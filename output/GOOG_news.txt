We recently published a list of George Soros Net Worth and Top 10 Holdings in 2024. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stands in the list of George Soros Net Worth and Top 10 Holdings in 2024. George Soros is one of the biggest investors, businessmen, and philanthropists. Soros currently has a net worth of $7.2 billion, as of October 4, according to Forbes. The legendary billionaire investor managed client money between 1969 and 2011. Soros made a fortune after shorting the British pound in 1992, making $1 billion. He has donated over $32 billion to his philanthropic organization, Open Society, of which almost $15 billion has been distributed. You can also read our piece on the best growth stocks to buy according to George Soros. Soros is the author of multiple books including the very popular The Alchemy of Finance, Soros on Soros: Staying Ahead of the Curve, and The New Paradigm for Financial Markets: The Credit Crisis of 2008 and What it Means. He last wrote a book in 2019 named In Defense of Open Society. The book is a collection of Soros’ writings on various topics including artificial intelligence, machine learning, political philanthropy, and financial markets. According to Soros, AI poses a threat to democracies especially with its extensive surveillance capabilities. He suggests that to distinguish between right and wrong humans must strike a balance between understanding reality and assessing how to change the world in our favor. Artificial intelligence destroys the very essence of reality, creating a disbalance. Soros emphasizes the need for AI to be regulated but for these regulations to work, societies from across the globe must work together. He also added that in an ideal world, standard regulations may have been possible but our countries our run on two distinct ideologies, the open and closed society. Here is what Soros stated: “AI destroyed this simple schema because it has absolutely nothing to do with reality. AI creates its own reality and when that artificial reality fails to correspond to the real world –which happens quite often — it is discarded as hallucination. This made me almost instinctively opposed to AI and I wholeheartedly agree with the experts who argue that it needs to be regulated. But AI regulations have to be globally enforceable, because the incentive to cheat is too great; those who evade the regulations gain an unfair advantage.” Adding to this, he suggests that while AI may make closed societies more powerful it may pose a threat to open societies. In addition to that, Soros suggested that repressive regimes like China and Russia are benefitting from the incidence of AI and thus are able to garner greater control over less powerful nations. His primary concern around AI and technology is surveillance and the misuse of data. Soros said the following about the future of AI: “AI is developing incredibly fast, and it is impossible for ordinary human intelligence to fully understand it. Nobody can predict where it will take us. But we can be sure of one thing: AI helps closed societies and poses a mortal threat to open societies. That’s because AI is particularly good at producing instruments of control that help closed societies to surveil their subjects.” Soros founded the Soros Fund Management LLC, a private investment management firm in 1970. He is known for his contrarian investing philosophy and has made fortunes for himself and investors through his strategies. His hedge fund is based on the idea of making elaborate one-way bets on currency movements, commodity prices, stocks, bonds, and any assets driven by macroeconomic conditions. Soros is known to have let macroeconomic conditions shape his investment decisions. This is a crucial aspect of his trading strategy referred to as reflexivity. This strategy defies standard economic conditions and emphasizes that market participants have the power to influence market fundamentals, and consequently the financial market. In light of his contrarian investment philosophy, Soros said the following in his book, Staying Ahead of the Curve: “The prevailing wisdom is that markets are always right. I take the opposition position. I assume that markets are always wrong. Even if my assumption is occasionally wrong, I use it as a working hypothesis. It does not follow that one should always go against the prevailing trend. On the contrary, most of the time the trend prevails; only occasionally are the errors corrected. It is only on those occasions that one should go against the trend. This line of reasoning leads me to look for the flaw in every investment thesis. … I am ahead of the curve. I watch out for telltale signs that a trend may be exhausted. Then I disengage from the herd and look for a different investment thesis. Or, if I think the trend has been carried to excess, I may probe going against it. Most of the time we are punished if we go against the trend. Only at an inflection point are we rewarded.” Now that we have studied one of Soros’s most important investment philosophies, let’s take a look at the top 10 holdings of George Soros. Our Methodology We sifted through Soros Fund Management’s Q2 2024 13F filings and picked the fund’s top 10 picks. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the fund’s stakes in them. We have also mentioned the hedge fund sentiment around each stock. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting. Soros Fund Management’s Stake Value: $166.66 Million Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 216 Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is one of the biggest holdings of George Soros. The company owns a range of products, including Google Search, Google Maps, YouTube, Google Cloud, and Wyamo. The company is relentlessly working to improve the Gemini experience and is also actively involved in developing AI hardware, having launched its NVIDIA chip rival in May. While Google’s tensor processing units (TPU) only account for almost 20% of the market, its advancements promise higher market shares in the future. In addition to that, its six-generation chips are 67% more energy efficient compared to the previous generation of processors. The new chip will be made available to Google Cloud users by the end of 2024. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) logged revenue worth $85 billion in the fiscal second quarter of 2024, driven by the growing momentum in cloud and search. Additionally, over 60% of generative AI startups and 90% of generative AI unicorns are customers of the Google Cloud. One can infer that the technology giant is well-positioned to exploit the next wave of artificial intelligence and innovation, making it a solid investment. Analysts are bullish on GOOGL and their 12-month median price target of $205 points to a 26% upside from current levels. Overall, 216 investors held stakes worth $35.31 billion in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Of those, Fisher Asset Management was the highest stakeholder with a position of $8.86 billion. Patient Capital Management mentioned Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q2 2024 investor letter“ “Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) was a top contributor in the second quarter, finally catching up to its peers in the Magnificent 7. The company gained 20.8% in the period following strong first quarter earnings, a new $70B repurchase program (3% of shares outstanding) and the initiation of a cash dividend ($0.20 per share; 0.42% yield). We continue to believe the market underappreciates Google’s exposure to AI with its Gemini model being integrated into search results, YouTube advertising and its cloud offering. We continue to think that the cloud players will be the AI winners in the long-term, with Google being well positioned to take advantage. While the company trades at 24x 2024 earnings, if you remove the money-losing and under-earning businesses, you realize that you are paying below a market multiple for the core Google business. We do not believe there are many other AI winners trading at such an attractive multiple.” Overall, GOOG ranks 2nd on our list of George Soros Net Worth and Top 10 Holdings in 2024. Overall, GOOG ranks first among the top 10 holdings of George Soros. While we acknowledge the potential of healthcare companies, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: What Happens When a Stock Is Dropped From the S&P 500?

Being listed on the S&P 500 is a hallmark of success for many companies, symbolizing market leadership and investor confidence. However, it's not uncommon for companies to sometimes be delisted from this prestigious index. In fact, the average life span of a company on the S&P 500 is about 21 years. Delisting can occur for several reasons and may have immediate negative consequences for the company and its investors, affecting stock prices and market perceptions. Understanding what happens when a stock is delisted from the S&P 500 is crucial for investors and stakeholders. Read on to better understand the reasons behind delisting, its impact, and how recent examples shed light on this aspect of the stock market. The S&P 500, short for Standard & Poor's 500, is one of the most widely followed stock market indexes in the world. It represents the performance of 500 large companies listed on stock exchanges in the U.S. Along with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and the Nasdaq composite, the S&P 500 is considered one of the main benchmarks of the U.S. stock market's health and performance. The index is host to many of the world's most important companies and household names, including the following (by market cap weight as of the fourth quarter of 2024): The S&P 500 has specific criteria for including companies in the index. While the choice by S&P 500 about inclusion is more than just specific measures, these are the main thresholds a company must meet: The S&P 500 is not simply a list of the 500 largest companies by market capitalization. The inclusion process involves careful consideration by the index committee. They meet quarterly to review which companies to add or drop. The committee also monitors for significant developments (such as mergers, bankruptcies, or restructuring) that might affect index composition. While meeting the inclusion criteria is necessary, it doesn't guarantee being included. The committee has discretion when adding new companies. When adding or removing companies, the committee aims to decrease index turnover while ensuring the index represents the large-cap U.S. equity market. The index's composition changes are typically announced with several days' notice. This allows index funds and other market participants time to prepare for the change. Companies can be removed from the S&P 500 for various reasons, which we can broadly categorize into voluntary and involuntary delistings: Some companies delist themselves from the S&P 500 or other major indexes. Reasons for voluntary delisting include the following: More commonly, companies are involuntarily removed from the S&P 500 because of failing to meet the index's criteria. Reasons can include the following: When a stock is removed from the S&P 500, it typically has significant effects on the stock and its investors. Short-Term Consequences: Long-Term Consequences: Companies that fall out of the S&P 500 can be included again. For example, Dell was in the S&P 500 before going private in 2013. The company was relisted in the index Sept. 23, 2024, to mark its 40th anniversary. Being added to the S&P 500 is often a significant achievement for a company. It brings several benefits, many of which are the opposite of being removed from the index: Here are several of the major companies removed from the index in 2024: Whirlpool, a major U.S. manufacturer of home appliances, was removed from the S&P 500 index in early 2024. Reasons for delisting: Effects: The removal of American Airlines (AAL) from the S&P 500 in 2024 reflected broader challenges facing the airline industry and the company's specific financial struggles. Reasons for delisting: Effects: The removal of Etsy Inc. (ETSY) from the S&P 500 was driven by changes in consumer behavior and ever more competition in ecommerce. Reasons for delisting: Effects: Other companies removed from the S&P 500 in 2024 include the following firms: As companies are moved out of the S&P 500 index, new companies are added to take their place. In 2024, the following were some of those added: You don't get your money back when a stock is removed from the index. You still own the same number of shares in the company. However, the value of those shares may decrease, and it may become more difficult to sell them. Index funds are mutual and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the performance of a specific market index, such as the S&P 500. It provides investors with broad market exposure and typically offers lower fees than actively managed funds, as it simply mimics the composition of the chosen index rather than trying to outperform it. This depends on your investment strategy and the specific circumstances of the stock's removal. Stock prices are often negatively affected following its removal. In any case, it's important to reassess the company's fundamentals and prospects. Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice if needed. Being delisted from the S&P 500 is a significant event for any company, often leading to immediate and negative consequences, such as a drop in stock price and reduced visibility. It can be voluntary because of a merger, going private, a falling market cap, or not meeting other index criteria. However, it's important to remember that delisting doesn't necessarily mean a company is doomed to fail. Some companies use this as a chance to restructure, refocus, and potentially return more robust than before. For investors, a stock's delisting from the S&P 500 should prompt a careful reassessment of the investment.
