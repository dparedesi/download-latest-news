ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) possesses a strong historical precedent for delivering rapid, significant share price appreciation, including rallies of over 30% in under two months (as seen in 2010 and 2024), and an even rarer surge of more than 50% in 2025. This established momentum highlights the stock's potential for high-velocity gains, which investors can capitalize on when specific business catalysts align. The current market strength is anchored by recent performance across three core business segments, all detailed in the company's Q2 2025 results. The primary drivers for continued growth are: These quantifiable operational successes provide a strong fundamental basis for another powerful upswing in Alphabet's share price. Investing in a single stock can be risky, but there is a huge value to a broader diversified approach. If you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock like GOOGL, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. It certainly helps if the fundamentals check out. For details on GOOGL, read Buy or Sell GOOGL Stock. Below are a few numbers that matter. *LTM: Last Twelve Months When thinking about risk for GOOGL, it helps to look at how much it fell during major market crises. The biggest hit was the Global Financial Crisis, with a drop of about 65%. The Inflation Shock in 2022 also pushed shares down by around 44%. The Covid pandemic brought a dip near 31%, and even the 2018 correction wasn’t mild, with a 23% decline. Look at – How Low Can GOOGL Stock Really Go – for more details. These numbers show that while GOOGL is strong on fundamentals, it’s not immune when markets turn sour. Drawdowns of this size are something to keep in mind, even for big names. Investing in a single stock without comprehensive analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.
