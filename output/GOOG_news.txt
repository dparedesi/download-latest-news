Thinking at the speed of AI? … “Bitcoin was the solution to being profitable on the Internet without advertising after all”— essay in eric kim voice … Curiosity —> these tech stocks,,,, are based on digital information ,, not physical products,, so why they dropping? Key Points Why Google’s and Meta’s Stocks Are Down Market Reaction to TariffsRecent tariff announcements by President Donald Trump, effective as of early April 2025, have led to significant market volatility. These tariffs, including a 10% blanket tariff on all imports and higher rates for specific countries like China (34%), have raised concerns about increased costs for companies with global supply chains. For Google, this means higher expenses for imported components used in hardware like Pixel phones and Chromebooks, potentially squeezing profit margins. For Meta, similar cost increases affect its hardware division, such as Oculus VR headsets. Impact on Advertising RevenueBoth Google and Meta rely heavily on advertising revenue, which could be indirectly hit by tariffs. Higher prices for imported goods may reduce consumer spending, leading to lower ad budgets from businesses, especially international advertisers. For Meta, it’s noted that 10% of its 2023 revenue came from Chinese companies advertising on platforms like Facebook and Instagram, which could be at risk if tariffs raise costs for these advertisers Why Trump’s Tariffs Are Rattling Even Meta. Global Operations and Economic UncertaintyBoth companies have significant international operations, and the tariff-induced economic uncertainty could disrupt global trade, affecting their revenue streams. This broader market unease, as seen in the sharp declines in major indexes like the Nasdaq (down 5.97% on April 3, 2025), has contributed to the stock drops Stocks ravaged by tariff fallout as global supply chains brace for impact.
