Investing.com -- GE Vernova's shares hit a new intraday high of over $407 on Tuesday, bolstered by investor confidence despite recent political developments. RBC Capital analysts reaffirmed their Outperform rating on the stock in a note Tuesday, emphasizing that President Trump's recent executive order on wind leasing and permitting is unlikely to have a significant impact on the company. The executive order temporarily bans offshore wind energy leases within the Outer Continental Shelf and pauses the issuance of new or renewed permits for onshore and offshore wind projects on federal lands, pending a review of federal wind leasing and permitting practices. However, RBC noted that only about 5% of the total utility-scale wind energy capacity in the U.S. comes from facilities on public lands. "We do not believe the executive order is of material significance," RBC analysts wrote. "We do not believe the announcement will have a material impact on GEV, given the limited exposure to offshore wind in the U.S. and limited onshore wind development on Federal land." The executive order aligns with President Trump's campaign promises to foster a reliable energy economy, citing legal deficiencies as the rationale for the ban. Despite this, RBC maintains a neutral sentiment on the broader implications for GE Vernova and reiterated its price target of $376 ib the stock.

Title: What Analysts Think of GE Vernova's Stock Ahead of Earnings
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/what-analysts-think-of-ge-vernova-stock-ahead-of-earnings-8775587

GE Vernova (GEV) is set to report earnings before the market opens Wednesday as the energy company approaches one year since General Electric completed its split into three separate companies. Analysts covering the stock tracked by Visible Alpha are mostly bullish, with 10 rating the stock a "buy," and two giving it a "hold" rating. Their price targets range from $361 to $446, with the average at about $392 sitting below Friday's record level after a strong week for the stock. Shares of GE Vernova gained nearly 3% Friday to close at an all-time high of $401.41, and have nearly tripled in value since their April debut. The company is expected to report revenue of $10.73 billion for the final quarter of 2024, up from $10.04 billion in the same time last year, when it was still part of General Electric. Net income is expected to come in at $634.87 million, after two of the company's first three quarters as a standalone company have resulted in net losses. The company said in previous quarters that its wind segment, the lone unprofitable arm of GE Vernova's three divisions, should be "approaching profitability" by the end of the fiscal year. The company said the shift will take time as it moves away from higher-cost offshore wind projects. Analysts have upgraded GE Vernova or lifted their price targets several times since it became its own company, including Bank of America analysts earlier this week. They have cited the growing demand for energy, especially in renewable forms, to power projects like data centers and artificial intelligence products as a positive catalyst for GE Vernova's sales going forward. The other former GE divisions, GE Aerospace (GE) and GE HealthCare (GEHC), are set to report their fourth-quarter results on Jan. 23 and Feb. 13, respectively.
