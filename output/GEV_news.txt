Natural gas (NG=F) prices are on track to close out the year in negative territory. But there's optimism for 2025, largely because of exports and more demand stemming from artificial intelligence. "We’re constructive on power, and because we’re constructive on power, we think natural gas is going to perform well," said Francisco Blanch, head of Bank of America's global commodities and derivatives research, during a recent energy outlook roundtable. Natural gas prices are down 13% year to date, largely because of milder winters and a supply glut. But industry watchers are betting on increasing gas exports and greater power demand from the on-shoring of manufacturing facilities and AI data centers. "These ... centers have to run 24/7," BofA's Blanch said. Power demand for data centers is expected to grow between 10% and 15% per year between now and 2030 — and that could account for up to 5% of total worldwide power demand by 2030. "[Natural gas] will allow the infrastructure to be built and let it power the generation plants to make electricity," Dennis Kissler, senior vice president at BOK Financial, told Yahoo Finance. "Natural gas will be the fuel of the future," he added. Case in point: Energy equipment maker and servicing company GE Vernova (GEV) recently raised its projections for its gas turbines. "You think about the US, and between 40% to 45% of our electricity comes from gas power today, and we're about to go into a real load cycle," GE Vernova CEO Scott Strazik recently told Yahoo Finance. "In the rest of the world, that number is closer to 25%. But as other parts of the world shift like the US has shifted — with things like coal to gas — the proportion of gas electricity will only grow." The erosion of regulation surrounding the energy business, which is anticipated under the new Trump administration, is also expected to benefit the industry. For example, the administration is expected to get rid of restrictions surrounding liquified natural gas (LNG) export permits and pipeline projects. "Regulations act as an added cost," said Philip Rossetti, a resident senior fellow at the right-leaning R Street Institute. "If you're expecting less regulation you're probably going to be expecting more profitability." Oklahoma-based natural gas processing and transportation company the Williams Companies (WMB) and oil and gas midstream operator Oneok (OKE) are both up more than 40% year to date. Meanwhile, US LNG exports are expected to rise 15% next year, according to government data, as Europe continues to build storage capacity to reduce its dependence on Russia amid the Ukraine war. S&P Global Commodity Insights predicts prices at Henry Hub, the main futures contracts delivery point, will average more than $4.00 per million metric British thermal units (MMBtu) in 2025 after two years averaging below $3.00/MMBtu. "The uptick in exports will put significant strain on the domestic US natural gas market," the organization's 2025 energy outlook report said. Still, some Wall Street analysts believe the full impact of policy changes around exports and delays around LNG supply projects may slow any upward price move. Goldman Sachs analysts now expect natural gas to reach $4/MMBtu in 2026 instead of its previous timeline of the fourth quarter of 2025. Ines Ferre is a senior business reporter for Yahoo Finance.

GE Vernova (GEV) shares jumped on Wednesday, one day after the energy equipment maker raised its long-term sales outlook. The company, which projected 2028 sales of about $45 billion, also announced a 25-cent quarterly dividend and $6 billion stock buyback. Since the company’s spinoff from GE Aerospace (GE) on April 2 as part of three-way breakup of the General Electric conglomerate, GE Vernona shares have more than doubled, boosted by surging demand for gas turbines and electrical grid equipment used to generate power for artificial intelligence (AI) data centers. The stock gained 5% to close Wednesday near $344. Below, we take a closer look at GE Vernova’s chart and apply technical analysis to locate important price levels worth watching after the company’s financial update. After topping out in November, GE Vernova shares consolidated within an ascending triangle before breaking down below the pattern’s lower trendline in Tuesday’s trading session. However, the shares staged an impressive intraday reversal today to close back within the triangle on the highest trading volume since early June, potentially creating a bear trap in the process. Moreover, the relative strength index (RSI) turned upwards after several consecutive lower readings, signaling improving price momentum. Let’s identify important overhead areas on GE Vernova's chart to watch and also point out two key support levels to monitor during retracements. Amid further buying, investors should watch how the stock's price responds to the $355 area, a region on the chart where it may encounter selling pressure near the ascending triangle's top trendline. To project a price target above the stock's record high, investors can use the measuring principle, a technique that analyzes prior price action to forecast future moves. To apply the tool to GE Vernova’s chart, we calculate the distance between the ascending triangle’s two trendlines near their widest point and add that amount to the pattern’s top trendline. In this case, we add $45 to $355, which projects a bullish target of $400, an area where those who bought the stock at lower levels could decide to lock in profits. The first lower level to watch sits around $295. This area, currently situated just below the 50-day moving average, could provide support near the low of a bullish engulfing pattern and other nearby trading activity that formed on the chart towards the top of the stock’s trending move between August and November Finally, selling below this area could see a decline to the $258 level, a region on the chart where the shares could attract buying interest near a cluster on candlesticks positioned around the September peak.
