Investors are excited about the nuclear energy outlook. Energy demand is on the rise, partly due to the rapid buildout of AI data centers. These technology campuses can use as much electricity as small cities. Nuclear energy is an appealing option for serving increased power demand because it has low carbon emissions and cost advantages relative to wind and solar power. If you expect nuclear energy companies to capitalize on the growing need for cheap, clean energy, then read on. The five best nuclear energy stocks introduced below may be worth a look for your portfolio.

The company operates natural gas, nuclear, coal, solar assets and battery energy storage facilities. With a total capacity of about 41,000 megawatts, Vistra is one of the largest power producers in the U.S. Vistra has been increasing and protecting its nuclear capacity by acquiring the minority interest in its Vistra Vision subsidiary and extending licenses at two owned nuclear facilities. The company created Vistra Vision with an 85% ownership position after purchasing nuclear and retail assets from Energy Harbor in 2023. Vistra has great liquidity and an active share repurchase program. The third quarter 2024 balance sheet included $905 million of cash and equivalents plus nearly $2.5 billion in availability on a revolving credit facility. Share repurchases over the last three years have totaled $4.58 billion. The company has reduced its share count by 30% in that time, achieving a buyback yield over 7%. Vistra also pays a small dividend yield of 0.52%. GE Vernova is a clean energy spin-off from General Electric (GE). The company generates, transfers, converts and stores electricity in the U.S. and globally. GEV's power portfolio includes products and services for gas, nuclear, hydro and steam power generation. Since spinning off from GE in 2023, GEV has turned a profit and more than tripled its free cash flow. The company has also published a promising five-year outlook. GEV’s 2028 guidance includes $45 billion in revenue and $14 billion in free cash flow. This represents substantial growth from the 2024 results of $1.4 billion in revenue and $1.7 billion in free cash flow. Capacity expansions and rising EBITDA margins across the power, electrification and wind businesses will be key profit drivers. Nuclear will play a role in GEV's growth. The company's alliance GE Hitachi produces the BWRX-300 small modular reactor, which offers scale and size advantages. Specifically, the reactor can be constructed in 36 months and requires a much smaller plant footprint than other options. The BWRX-300 will be deployable globally as early as 2029. Talen Energy sells electricity produced by its nuclear, fossil, solar and coal power plants. The company's power generation capacity is approximately 10.7 gigawatts, including 2.2 gigawatts of nuclear power. Talen Energy has a relationship with Amazon’s cloud computing division AWS. The power company sold a nuclear-powered data center campus to AWS in 2023. Talen also signed a 15-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with AWS. In November 2024, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) blocked the PPA due to transparency issues. Talen has subsequently filed a lawsuit against the ruling. Despite the FERC disagreement, the investment community is excited about Talen’s ability to supply carbon-free power to data centers. Analysts expect a revenue dip for Talen in 2025, followed by four years of double-digit growth. The average revenue growth expectation in 2026 is nearly 93%. The company also has a strong share repurchase program and good liquidity. The share repurchase target is 70% of adjusted free cash flow. At September 30, 2024, Talen had $648 million of cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet. BWX Technologies supplies nuclear components and services, primarily to the U.S. government. The offering includes naval nuclear reactors, commercial nuclear components and nuclear facility management. BWXT recently announced it would acquire Kinetrics, a leading nuclear services company. The acquisition, to close mid-2025, should add $300 million to BWX’s commercial segment. This complements the company's government business, which recently secured $2.1 billion in new naval nuclear contracts. Strength in the company’s government business drove 14% revenue growth and 15% GAAP EPS growth in the third quarter 2024. The company raised its full-year 2024 revenue and non-GAAP EPS guidance based on the strong performance through the third quarter. The consensus price target for BWXT is $127.50, 18.4% higher than the stock’s current value. Centrus Energy provides uranium enrichment and nuclear reactor engineering services. Nuclear reactors require enriched uranium fuel, which has a higher concentration of the uranium-235 isotope. LEU is the only U.S.-owned, U.S.-technology uranium enrichment company. Centrus’s leadership team believes this is an advantage in winning U.S. federal contracts. The future opportunity in federal work could be substantial. There is currently $3.4 billion in federal funding already approved by Congress. However, $700 million of that is appropriated under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which President Trump paused by an executive order in January. Centrus already has multiple contracts with the Department of Energy, including one with a recently expanded Phase 2 contract value of $129 million. The company has sales momentum, too. 2024 revenue grew 38% to $442 million. However, higher cost of sales led to a profit decline in the period. Centrus does have a $3.7 billion backlog that extends to 2040. Bottom Line Nuclear companies are uniquely positioned to provide cost-effective, low-carbon energy to power the future. The ones that will rise to the top—whether they're power generators, reactor and component makers or service providers—will have proven business models, substantial liquidity and recurring cash flow to support capacity expansion and innovation.
