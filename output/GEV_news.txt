Since it emerged as an independent energy entity in early 2024, its stock has soared nearly 68% year-to-date. This performance isn't merely strong—it far surpasses market expectations, crushing the S&P. So, what is driving this impressive surge? At its essence, GE Vernova is benefiting from a robust energy infrastructure supercycle. With the rapid expansion of AI data centers, electrification, and grid developments, there is a pressing need for infrastructure—and Vernova’s gas turbines, grid technology, and renewable energy solutions are central to this growth. The firm has reported a significant increase in turbine orders, and its backlog has now surpassed $120 billion. This demand is not just busy—it signifies a booked-out-for-years scenario. With the AI boom also playing a role, it becomes clear why major investors are investing heavily. Although GEV stock has shown volatility, if you're looking for potential rewards with less fluctuation than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative, having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns of over 91% since its launch. When GE separated into distinct companies, Vernova was perceived as the more industrial, slower-growing counterpart. However, that perception has quickly changed. The company has strengthened its balance sheet, enhanced profit margins, and demonstrated impressive execution under its new leadership. All attention is focused on the Q2 earnings report (scheduled for July 23), with expectations soaring. If Vernova continues to exceed projections and demonstrate solid profitability, the upward trend could persist. The AI energy boom shows no signs of fading—and Vernova’s turbines are right at the heart of the action. High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which includes a selection of 30 stocks, boasts a history of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the past four years. Why does this happen? As a collection, HQ Portfolio stocks have yielded superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; resulting in a smoother experience, as demonstrated by HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
