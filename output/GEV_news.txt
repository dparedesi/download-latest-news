GE Aerospace (GE) is set to report second-quarter results before the opening bell on Thursday, with traders expecting a sizable move in the company's stock by the end of the week. Current options pricing suggests traders anticipate GE Aerospace stock could move about 5% above or below Wednesday's close to around $266 by Friday. At the high end, that would put GE Aerospace shares above $280, after a strong year for the stock so far. The shares have surged about 60% in 2025 as GE Aerospace has passed the one-year mark since General Electric's transformation into three separate companies was completed last April. GE Vernova (GEV) is slated to post its own second-quarter results next week. GE Aerospace shares have been volatile after their recent reports. In the last two quarters, shares rose more than 6% on the day of each report, while they fell 9% and 5.6% on the day of the two prior reports. Last quarter, GE Aerospace topped estimates as the company said it was taking steps to mitigate the negative impact tariffs could have on its profits. GE Aerospace is expected to report a 13% increase in revenue from the same time a year ago to $10.27 billion, while adjusted earnings per share are projected have jumped nearly 20% to $1.43, according to estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. All 10 analysts tracked by Visible Alpha who cover GE Aerospace call the stock a "buy," though not all of them expect the stock to continue rising, with some price targets below Wednesday's close. Their average price target, however, assumes slight upside at about $270.
