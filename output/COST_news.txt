Title: Costco shares downgraded to Hold at Truist amid valuation concerns

On Tuesday, Truist Securities adjusted its stance on Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST), moving from a Buy rating to Hold. The firm has set a price target for Costco at $873.00. The downgrade reflects a cautious view on the stock's current valuation despite the company's strong market position and its success in gaining market share across various retail segments. According to Truist Securities, Costco has established significant barriers to entry in the retail sector and continues to exhibit robust business performance. "However, some changes like the shift towards scanning IDs on entry and packaging changes to their chickens could add some sls headwinds, key catalysts are in the rearview mirror and the stock's valuation leaves little room for error," said Truist analysts in a note to cients. Additionally, Truist Securities notes that while Costco's stock has seen substantial growth, increasing by approximately 60% over the past 12 months compared to the S&P 500's 30% gain, the stock is now trading at around 54 times forward twelve-month earnings per share (EPS), which is considered a multi-decade high. The analysts from Truist Securities stated, "The business remains strong, it is gaining share vs. virtually all classes of trade and likely has the highest barriers to entry in all of retail, in our view." Despite this, the firm suggests that the major catalysts for Costco's stock performance have already occurred. In other recent news, Costco Wholesale Corp (NASDAQ:COST) has made significant updates to its bylaws, introducing a cure process for shareholder director nominations. This move is part of a larger effort to refine the company's corporate governance practices and enhance communication with shareholders. Costco has seen considerable analyst activity and strong sales growth. Redburn-Atlantic revised its rating from "Buy" to "Neutral," citing concerns over the stock's valuation, despite raising the price target to $890. Oppenheimer, Stifel, and Baird maintained positive ratings, with Oppenheimer and Stifel raising their price targets to $955 and $915 respectively, due to robust sales growth and positive earnings estimates. Costco reported a 6.7% rise in U.S. comparable sales and a significant 23.3% growth in consolidated e-commerce sales. The company's non-foods category experienced a low double-digit increase, contributing to the robust performance. Baird maintained an Outperform rating with a consistent price target of $975, emphasizing Costco's steady global core comparable sales and a slight increase in its fourth-quarter earnings per share forecast. As investors digest the cautious stance from Truist Securities on Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST), a glance at the real-time data from InvestingPro provides additional context for the stock's current valuation. Costco holds a significant market capitalization of $406.57 billion, with a high Price/Earnings (P/E) ratio of 56.7, which aligns with Truist's concerns about the stock trading at a multi-decade high earnings multiple. Despite the high valuation, Costco's revenue growth remains robust, with a 7.75% increase over the last twelve months as of Q3 2024. From an operational standpoint, Costco's gross profit margin stands at 12.5%, a figure that may raise some eyebrows considering the InvestingPro Tip that highlights the company's weak gross profit margins. However, investors might find solace in the company's ability to maintain dividend payments for 21 consecutive years, coupled with a strong return over the last year, which could signal a continued commitment to shareholder returns despite the high valuation metrics. For those seeking more detailed analysis, InvestingPro offers additional tips, including insights on Costco's cash flow capabilities and its position within the Consumer Staples Distribution & Retail industry. With 17 more InvestingPro Tips available, investors can further evaluate the company's financial health and market position by visiting the dedicated InvestingPro page for Costco at https://www.investing.com/pro/COST.

Dirt Cheap Gold is a gold price comparison tool that helps you find the best deals on 1-ounce gold coins and bars from trusted vendors. Our bots search the internet for the lowest prices, so you donât have to waste time checking multiple sites. We donât use gimmicksâjust straightforward, unbiased data. If you're looking for the cheapest way to stack gold, this is your go-to resource. We automatically update deals every hour. The deals on this page are current as of 00:02 UTC on 2024-09-26. Email paydirt@dirtcheapgold.com Gold has historically been considered a strong store of value, especially during times of economic uncertainty or inflation. Over the long term, the price of gold has steadily increased, reflecting its role as a hedge against currency depreciation and market volatility. While gold may not offer the same short-term returns as stocks, it tends to retain its value over time, making it a popular choice for preserving wealth. However, like any investment, its performance can fluctuate, and it's important to consider it as part of a diversified portfolio. A stacker is someone who accumulates precious metals, like gold or silver, as a form of wealth preservation. Stackers typically prefer physical bullion such as coins or bars and focus on long-term investment strategies. The goal is often to "stack" as much metal as possible to protect against inflation or economic uncertainty. Most stackers aim to accumulate 5-10% of their net worth in metal. Stacking starts with choosing the right type of gold for your collection. Most beginners opt for popular 1 ounce coins or bars like the American Gold Eagle or Canadian Maple Leaf. Make sure to buy from reputable dealers, compare premiums over spot price, and consider storage options like a safe or bank vault. Diversify your purchases over time, and be mindful of your budget, ensuring that you buy when the price aligns with your goals. The premium on gold coins and bars is the additional cost above the spot price of gold. This premium covers manufacturing, minting, distribution, and dealer costs. Coins tend to have higher premiums than bars due to their intricate designs and collectible value, whereas bars are usually closer to the spot price because they are simpler to produce. We focus on 1-ounce gold bars and coins because they are the most popular and widely traded form of gold bullion. They offer a great balance between affordability and liquidity, making them ideal for both new investors and experienced stackers. Larger bars might offer lower premiums, but 1-ounce products are more flexible when it comes to buying, selling, or trading. Costco began selling gold to members in 2023, offering 1 oz gold bars primarily through its online store. Executive members can enjoy a 2% discount, and using the Costco Anywhere Visa card adds an additional 2% cashback â a combined 4% discount that you'll receive later in the form of a rebate. These savings make Costco a competitive option for purchasing gold, though stock is often limited and sells out quickly. Costco's products don't always appear in the main list on this page, but the table below shows all of the 1 ounce gold products currently available on Costco's website. The discounted prices of these products might make them competitive with products from other sellers. Purchase from Costco or Walmart. Those sellers don't have higher prices or fees for credit cards. Storing your gold securely is crucial to protecting your investment. Many stackers choose to store their gold in a home safe, but itâs important to ensure it is fireproof and bolted down. Alternatively, you can store gold in a bank's safe deposit box or a specialized vault service, which offers additional layers of security and insurance. Whether you need to pay sales tax on gold depends on your location. In many states or countries, precious metals like gold are exempt from sales tax if purchased for investment purposes, especially above certain thresholds. Itâs important to check local tax laws to see if exemptions apply where you live. Selling gold is relatively straightforward. You can sell to local coin shops, bullion dealers, or on online platforms like r/Pmsforsale that specialize in precious metals. Itâs important to shop around for the best offer, as prices and premiums may vary. Ensure you understand any fees involved before making a transaction. The amount you can sell your gold for depends on the current spot price of gold and the type of gold you are selling. Dealers will typically offer you slightly below the spot price to cover their costs, and this is known as the buyback price. The condition and purity of your gold, as well as market demand, can also affect the price. Shop around for competitive offers, and always sell to a reputable dealer to get the best value.

Investors seeking stocks that can withstand short-term pressures and deliver over the long term should track the recommendations of top Wall Street analysts. Bearing that in mind, here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance. This week's first pick is game developer Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO). In August, the company reported better-than-expected adjusted earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Recently, Baird analyst Colin Sebastian reiterated a buy rating on Take-Two Interactive stock with a price target of $172. The analyst is upbeat about the company's upcoming releases and expects its bookings to increase by at least 40% in the next fiscal year following mid-single-digit growth this year. Sebastian's robust bookings growth estimate is backed by the expected release of key titles – Civilization VII, Borderlands 4 and the much-anticipated Grand Theft Auto VI (GTA VI). Moreover, he expects the company's new console/PC releases to deliver about $2.25 billion in incremental bookings. He anticipates the mobile business will contribute around $3.1 billion, and catalog/live services will generate $2.5 billion in the full year. While management has expressed high confidence in its ability to release GTA VI next year, the analyst thinks that any potential delay between two fiscal years would have a limited impact on TTWO's two-year earnings path. He expects this vital release to generate about $3 billion of bookings in the first year, while enhancing the company's financial flexibility with over $2 billion in free cash flow. "Beyond the next 12-24 months, Take Two should benefit from the long-tail of live services/catalog sales and further depth in the pipeline with sequels to Red Dead, BioShock and Max Payne, and perhaps new 2K sports franchises," said Sebastian. Sebastian ranks No. 286 among more than 9,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 56% of the time, delivering an average return of 12.8%. (See TTWO Ownership Structure on TipRanks) Baird analyst Peter Benedict is bullish on the prospects of membership-only warehouse chain Costco Wholesale (COST). Earlier this month, Costco reported a 7.1% rise in its net sales for the retail month of August (the four weeks ended Sept. 1). Excluding the impact of changes on gasoline prices and foreign exchange, Costco's August comparable sales also grew 7.1%. Benedict noted that the August comparable sales growth was sequentially steady compared to the 7.2% increase in July, as stronger traffic was offset by some moderation in average traffic growth. Benedict increased his Q4 fiscal 2024 EPS estimate to $5.10 compared to the Street's consensus estimate of $5.07 per share to reflect better-than-expected sales in the fiscal quarter. "COST's traction with consumers continues to stand out against an increasingly challenged spending backdrop," said the analyst. Benedict highlighted that the company delivered solid core comparable sales growth yet again and displayed persistent strength in the non-foods area, even as there is continued softness in discretionary categories across most of the retail sector. The analyst thinks that Costco's "growth staple" appeal remains intact, thanks to its consistent performance, store network expansion, encouraging membership key performance indicators and the recently announced fee hike. He reiterated a buy rating on COST stock with a price target of $975. Benedict ranks No. 30 among more than 9,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 71% of the time, delivering an average return of 16.1%. (See COST Options Trading on TipRanks) Streaming giant Netflix (NFLX) is the third pick for this week. Despite macro pressures and intense competition in the streaming space, the company has been able to impress investors with its crackdown on password sharing and the rollout of an ad-supported tier. JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth contends that while "advertising is not in NFLX's DNA" and the company is creating the ad tier from scratch, it has the ability to emerge as a major ad player as scale and monetization grow in 2025 and beyond. He estimates that ad revenue, excluding the subscriptions component, will account for more than 10% of the company's revenue in 2027. The analyst acknowledges that the scale of Netflix's ad tier currently lags behind that of peers like Amazon, which gained from automatically including its Prime members in its ad-supported tier. That said, he is confident that Netflix can boost its scale by making changes in plans and pricing, bundling offers and providing live content that has extensive appeal. Anmuth further explained that while Netflix's ad tier is dilutive to its overall average revenue per member, the impressive 150% growth in the company's upfront ad sales commitments, greater scale and improved focus on ad formats and ad tech should drive higher monetization. Overall, Anmuth is optimistic about Netflix's ability to grow its top line in the mid-teens this year and in 2025, further improve its margins, and deliver multi-year free cash flow growth. He reaffirmed a buy rating on NFLX stock with a price target of $750. Anmuth ranks No. 99 among more than 9,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 61% of the time, delivering an average return of 17.7%. (See NFLX Financials on TipRanks) Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Title: What To Expect in the Markets This Week

Time Published: 2024-09-22T11:00:00Z

Federal Reserve officials will speak this week, providing more insight into their recent decision to reduce interest rates. Friday's release of the August Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index will show whether inflation continues to slow. Investors can expect fresh data on new and pending home sales, along with an update on housing prices, and consumer sentiment surveys. Micron Technology (MU), Costco Wholesale (COST), Accenture (ACN), and more will also report earnings. Monday, Sept. 23 Tuesday, Sept. 24 Wednesday, Sept. 25 Thursday, Sept. 26 Friday, Sept. 27 Following last week’s closely watched Federal Reserve decision to enact a jumbo-sized interest rate cut, investors will hear from Fed officials this week about their impressions of the U.S. economy. Fed Chair Jerome Powell will deliver pre-recorded opening remarks at Thursday’s 2024 U.S. Treasury Market Conference, his first remarks since last week’s press conference. Other notable speakers will deliver remarks at the event, including New York Fed President John Williams, Fed Vice Chair Michael Barr, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, and Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, and Boston Fed President Susan Collins are also scheduled to deliver remarks this week. On Friday, market watchers will likely be focused on the latest inflation data, as the August reading of the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index will show whether price pressures continue to cool. The July PCE reading showed the Fed’s preferred inflation measurement was down to an annual rate of 2.5%, still higher than the central bank’s target. Investors will look for more progress on inflation. KB Home’s earnings report on Tuesday could also provide some insight into the health of the housing market. According to a Bank of America analysis, the Fed’s interest rate decision is likely to drive down mortgage rates and potentially improve homebuilders' performance. Memory chip maker and Nvidia (NVDA) partner Micron Technology will report earnings Wednesday, after Morgan Stanley recently downgraded its stock, warning about the health of the memory chip market. Micron’s report comes after its prior quarter earnings were lower than analysts projected, and its revenue guidance disappointed investors. Costco’s earnings on Thursday follows its recent decision to raise membership fees for the first time in seven years, effective Sept. 1. Analysts are expecting the retailer to report higher year-over-year revenue and profit, with memberships rising to 75 million.
