WESTCHESTER COUNTY, New York (WABC) -- Iris Katz arrived at the Trader Joe's in Hartsdale on Monday on a mission to buy some eggs. The mission failed. "Not even hard-boiled eggs," Katz said. "I'll try other places?" Even if she found the eggs, Trader Joe's now limits sales to one dozen per customer. "To ensure that as many of our customers who need eggs are able to purchase them when they visit Trader Joe's," said a company spokesperson. The short supply and the ever-present demand for eggs mean price hikes for consumers. According to the USDA, the average price of a dozen eggs is now $7.95, up from $3.30 this time last year. "I really noticed around December. The price was crazy. And normally, around the holiday times, it always goes down," shopper Dina Rose said. The egg shortage and resulting price hikes are the direct result of the highly contagious bird flu, which has decimated the number of egg-laying hens. Governor Kathy Hochul said inspectors recently detected bird flu at seven live poultry markets in Queens, the Bronx and Brooklyn. The governor has ordered two live markets in Westchester County to close, clean, and disinfect their premises. The same order applies to markets in Nassau and Suffolk counties, even though inspectors never detected bird flu at those locations. "It was $6.99 for a dozen, and I said forget about it. So my daughter buys at Costco, and she buys a bunch of them," shopper John Esposito said. We visited the Costco in Yonkers. They had eggs in stock at the cost of $8.49 for two dozen, but Costco also issued a limit of 3 cartons per customer. Analysts say stabilizing the egg supply centers on containing the bird flu outbreak and repopulating the number of egg-laying hens. They estimate that the process could take months. ---------- * Get Eyewitness News Delivered * Follow us on YouTube * More local news * Send us a news tip * Download the abc7NY app for breaking news alerts Have a breaking news tip or an idea for a story we should cover?

Since eggs have become the new measure of how our economy is doing, it’s worth noting our local Costco is completely out of them, which, if in stock, cost nearly twice as much as they did in December. (Note: It was never about the price of eggs… It’s about racism.)

Title: McDonald's earnings miss due to E. Coli outbreak and a decline in consumer spending

McDonald’s customers aren’t “lovin’ it.” The fast-food giant missed Wall Street’s expectations for the fourth quarter, largely due to the lingering effects of an E. coli outbreak and ongoing inflation pressures. The October incident sickened hundreds of customers and caused a massive drop in foot traffic, leading to a decline in same-store sales. In early trading, McDonald’s shares were slightly up. “Our fourth-quarter performance reflects the impact of the food incident,” CEO Chris Kempczinski said during the company’s Feb. 10 earnings call. The Illinois-based company reported revenue of $6.39 billion, missing Wall Street’s forecast of $6.44 billion in revenue, while earnings per share came in at $2.80 — meeting expectations. Additionally, U.S. same-store sales fell 1.4% year-over-year, surpassing the Street’s modest projection of 0.6%. The impact of the E. Coli outbreak, which began in late Oct. 2024, has started to reveal the toll it took on McDonald’s performance. Citi analyst Jon Tower said in a research note that he believes the outbreak marked the company’s “low point” and sees the coming quarter as “setting the table” for a recovery. However, inflation remains a challenge and is expected to persist in the near future. Jan. 2025 was another tough month for McDonald’s, despite optimism surrounding its McValue platform. BTIG analyst Peter Saleh noted that severe weather conditions across the U.S. complicated efforts to determine whether the value menu had increased foot traffic. In a note covering the restaurant industry, Bank of America set a 12-month price target of $312 for McDonald’s, reflecting steady growth expectations despite the challenges of its franchised business model. In Nov. 2024, the company announced a $100 million investment to support marketing efforts and franchisee operations. About 95% of U.S. locations are run by franchisees. BoA highlighted both upside and downside risks: Stronger-than-expected sales and cost savings could boost McDonald’s stock, while slow sales and margin pressure from inflation could weigh on its performance. According to foot-traffic analytics firm Placer.ai, inflation likely contributed to dips in McDonald’s visits, while budget-conscious consumers flocked to limited-time offers and special releases. The company has capitalized on this trend, driving significant foot traffic with the June launch of its $5 Meal Deal. Additionally, the Chicken Big Mac, introduced in Oct. 2024, drove a 7.2% increase in visits during its first week. The promotions help McDonald’s maintain its relevance. The company recently launched a “McValue” menu, expanding on its $5 meal deal. It’s also bringing back the Shamrock Shake. Other nostalgic promotions, such as collector’s cups relaunched in Aug. 2024, have proven extremely successful. The cups were so popular that customers resold them on third-party websites such as eBay for as much as $100 each. Elsewhere, McDonald’s also made headlines in Oct. 2024 when President Donald Trump staged a cook shift at a Pennsylvania location. The company quickly clarified it had no involvement in the event, noting that it was not “red or blue, but golden.” In Jan. 2025, McDonald’s announced it would scale back its Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) efforts, joining the likes of Google, Meta, and Walmart — but not Costco.

Title: Pokemon TCG Shortages Continue with Blooming Waters Release

The latest Pokemon TCG release once again results in empty shelves at release. By Amanda Kay Oaks It feels like only yesterday that people were brawling in Costco over Scarlet and Violet – Prismatic Evolutions Pokemon cards. Yet another popular Pokemon TCG set has arrived, and it’s seeing similar shortage issues to the Eeveelution set. The Pokemon 151: Blooming Waters Premium Collection launched on February 7th alongside the Prismatic Evolutions mini-tins. Both of these are new collections of cards that have already been printed, but clearly, demand for Pokemon 151 and Prismatic Evolutions remains high. This led Pokemon fans and resellers to once again line up at their local Gamestop, with disappointing results. Though no all-out fist fights have made the rounds with this latest release, many fans are sharing the long lines at retailers, particularly GameStop. Once again, there don’t seem to be nearly enough cards to go around as fans attempt to get ahold of even just one Blooming Waters set. In fact, many GameStop locations have reportedly been posting paper signs on their store windows with updates on their stock. And that stock seems suspiciously low, even by Pokemon TCG standards. While some lucky fans have managed to get their hands on the Blooming Waters Premiun Set, plenty of collectors are once again leaving empty handed. Many GameStop locations appeared to have anywhere from just a few to zero of the new Mini Tins, Surprise Boxes, and Blooming Waters sets. This led some fans to wonder if employees weren’t taking advantage of the early access to stock, as many question how stores have so few of the new sets even after the Pokemon Company promised to do better after Prismatic Evolutions. Shortly after the Costco debacle with the last Prismatic Evolutions release, GameStop posted a sassy message on social media. The repost of the viral video included a suggestion that, due to GameStop’s Blooming Waters limit of 2 per customer, their stores were above such issues. We support battling Pokémon, not battling over Pokémon.Blooming Waters arrives at GameStop on February 7th with a 2 per customer limit.Do better, @Costco. https://t.co/CgMXd8MY0E Many fans are thinking back on this post now, as stores seem unable to provide even those two measly boxes for most customers. As one post compiling signs from various GameStop locations reveals, many shops claimed to have only 1 or 2 total boxes of the new Pokemon TCG cards before they even opened. This has led many fans to speculate that employees must be buying up the stock before it hits shelves. Whether or not that’s true, many stores accepted preorders for Blooming Waters and the new additions to the Prismatic Evolutions line. So, it is certainly possible that the shortages are due to the fact that preorders accounted for most of the stock these locations received. Regardless of the cause, collectors are frustrated to once again line up early only to find no Pokemon TCG cards available. Others note the upcharge on stock that is available. The Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for the Blooming Waters Premium Collection. is $59.99. According to customer reports and the current website pricing, GameStop is selling the sets for $10 above that, at $69.99. This isn’t nearly the upcharge we can expect from resellers who nabbed the cards today, but has some customers feeling extra frustrated as the stock shortages and excess cost combine. Unlike with Prismatic Evolutions, The Pokemon Company has not yet issued a statement about the shortage issues for Blooming Waters specifically. They have, however, implemented changes to the Pokemon Center website in an effort to tackle bots and scalpers buying up cards online. Despite this, many fans report being unable to get ahold of the cards on release day. Clearly, the difference in supply and demand will continue to be an issue for Pokemon TCG fans for the foreseeable future. Were you able to get the Prismatic Evolutions or Blooming Waters sets?

Title: ‘I Feel Like a Drug Dealer’: How Beth’s Cafe Sources Eggs for Its 12-Egg Omelets

Filed under: The egg shortage has hit the legendary Green Lake diner, where the massive omelets cost as much as $42, particularly hard Beth’s Cafe, on the side of Aurora as you drive through Green Lake, is a battered, venerable diner that for decades has been the place in north Seattle to go when you need to eat after midnight. It’s small, it’s unpretentious, it’s family-friendly, and it has a problem: eggs. As nearly everyone knows by now, an outbreak of bird flu has killed so many chickens that the supply chain has been badly disrupted. Prices have gone up, stores are struggling to keep eggs in stock, and restaurants nationwide are scrambling (pun intended) to navigate the new environment. Some places have changed their menus to de-emphasize eggs while others are charging more — Waffle House now has a 50-cent per-egg surcharge. Among Seattle restaurants, Beth’s is particularly affected by this shortage. It’s famous for its massive, 12-egg omelets, and even its six-egg omelets and three-egg scrambles are heavy on the eggs. The diner goes through 15 to 20 cases of eggs a week, co-owner Mason Reed (who took over Beth’s last year) tells Eater Seattle. A case is 15 dozen eggs, so that means the restaurant cracks open upwards of 3,600 eggs a week, which averages to more than 500 per day. Since the onset of the bird flu, Reed has been stressed about getting enough eggs to meet that demand. Beth’s had been sourcing its eggs from Wilcox Farms, but “lately we’ve had to branch out,” the owner says. Reed and his team have been going to Costco and US Food’s Chef’Store and making calls to anywhere that might have eggs. The prices can vary wildly, and some distributors have limits on how many eggs they can sell. “It’s been a juggling act,” Reed says. “I feel like a drug dealer trying to find my source,” Reed adds. “I’m calling around, going, ‘What’s the price? How many can you offer?’” It’s not just the bird flu causing prices to rise. At the beginning of 2024, a new Washington law required all eggs sold in the state to be cage-free. The price per egg Beth’s was paying jumped from 9 cents to about 27 cents; a case was around $40, Reed says. In the past few months prices have jumped again and now Reed is paying anywhere from $80 to $150 per case, depending on the week. “It just is really turbulent,” says Reed. Menu prices reflect these changes. In 2020, the Triple Bypass version of the 12-egg omelet (with bacon, sausage, ham, and two kinds of cheese) was $22.50, according to the Seattle Times. In 2023, when Beth’s reopened after a temporary closure, the price had ticked up to $34.95. Now that same omelet is $41.95. Reed says he’s raised prices twice since the start of 2024, once to deal with the cost of the cage-free law and once to offset the cost of Seattle’s rising minimum wage. “Beth’s is famous for their big omelets, it’s not something I want to get rid of,” Reed says. But he is contemplating menu changes. Reed says the restaurant may try to have more non-egg options, including tofu scrambles, and offer smaller portions for under $15. “We’re trying our best to keep prices as low as possible,” he says. Beth’s may offer $42 omelets for the wannabe competitive eaters out there, but at its core it’s a diner that’s supposed to serve affordable, filling food to families and working people. At least Reed has found a stable source of eggs, for now. “They’re a lot more than they were, but [the price] is not going up,” he says. His new supplier is a California-based company called Alderwood Eggs, but he hesitates to throw that name around. “I don’t want to put it out there because I don’t want everyone to buy all my eggs.” Sign up for our newsletter.
