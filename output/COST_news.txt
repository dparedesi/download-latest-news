Dirt Cheap Gold is a gold price comparison tool that helps you find the best deals on 1-ounce gold coins and bars from trusted vendors. Our bots search the internet for the lowest prices, so you donât have to waste time checking multiple sites. We donât use gimmicksâjust straightforward, unbiased data. If you're looking for the cheapest way to stack gold, this is your go-to resource. We automatically update deals every 30 minutes. The deals on this page are current as of 13:02 UTC on 2024-09-24. Email paydirt@dirtcheapgold.com Gold has historically been considered a strong store of value, especially during times of economic uncertainty or inflation. Over the long term, the price of gold has steadily increased, reflecting its role as a hedge against currency depreciation and market volatility. While gold may not offer the same short-term returns as stocks, it tends to retain its value over time, making it a popular choice for preserving wealth. However, like any investment, its performance can fluctuate, and it's important to consider it as part of a diversified portfolio. A stacker is someone who accumulates precious metals, like gold or silver, as a form of wealth preservation. Stackers typically prefer physical bullion such as coins or bars and focus on long-term investment strategies. The goal is often to "stack" as much metal as possible to protect against inflation or economic uncertainty. Most stackers aim to accumulate 5-10% of their net worth in metal. Stacking starts with choosing the right type of gold for your collection. Most beginners opt for popular 1 ounce coins or bars like the American Gold Eagle or Canadian Maple Leaf. Make sure to buy from reputable dealers, compare premiums over spot price, and consider storage options like a safe or bank vault. Diversify your purchases over time, and be mindful of your budget, ensuring that you buy when the price aligns with your goals. The premium on gold coins and bars is the additional cost above the spot price of gold. This premium covers manufacturing, minting, distribution, and dealer costs. Coins tend to have higher premiums than bars due to their intricate designs and collectible value, whereas bars are usually closer to the spot price because they are simpler to produce. We focus on 1-ounce gold bars and coins because they are the most popular and widely traded form of gold bullion. They offer a great balance between affordability and liquidity, making them ideal for both new investors and experienced stackers. Larger bars might offer lower premiums, but 1-ounce products are more flexible when it comes to buying, selling, or trading. Costco began selling gold to members in 2023, offering 1 oz gold bars primarily through its online store. Executive members can enjoy a 2% discount, and using the Costco Anywhere Visa card adds an additional 2% cashback â a combined 4% discount that you'll receive later in the form of a rebate. These savings make Costco a competitive option for purchasing gold, though stock is often limited and sells out quickly. Costco's products don't always appear in the main list on this page, but the table below shows all of the 1 ounce gold products currently available on Costco's website. The discounted prices of these products might make them competitive with products from other sellers. ð¢ Costco doesn't have any 1 ounce gold products for sale right now. Purchase from Costco or Walmart. Those sellers don't have higher prices or fees for credit cards. Storing your gold securely is crucial to protecting your investment. Many stackers choose to store their gold in a home safe, but itâs important to ensure it is fireproof and bolted down. Alternatively, you can store gold in a bank's safe deposit box or a specialized vault service, which offers additional layers of security and insurance. Whether you need to pay sales tax on gold depends on your location. In many states or countries, precious metals like gold are exempt from sales tax if purchased for investment purposes, especially above certain thresholds. Itâs important to check local tax laws to see if exemptions apply where you live. Selling gold is relatively straightforward. You can sell to local coin shops, bullion dealers, or on online platforms like r/Pmsforsale that specialize in precious metals. Itâs important to shop around for the best offer, as prices and premiums may vary. Ensure you understand any fees involved before making a transaction. The amount you can sell your gold for depends on the current spot price of gold and the type of gold you are selling. Dealers will typically offer you slightly below the spot price to cover their costs, and this is known as the buyback price. The condition and purity of your gold, as well as market demand, can also affect the price. Shop around for competitive offers, and always sell to a reputable dealer to get the best value.

Investors seeking stocks that can withstand short-term pressures and deliver over the long term should track the recommendations of top Wall Street analysts. Bearing that in mind, here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance. This week's first pick is game developer Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO). In August, the company reported better-than-expected adjusted earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Recently, Baird analyst Colin Sebastian reiterated a buy rating on Take-Two Interactive stock with a price target of $172. The analyst is upbeat about the company's upcoming releases and expects its bookings to increase by at least 40% in the next fiscal year following mid-single-digit growth this year. Sebastian's robust bookings growth estimate is backed by the expected release of key titles – Civilization VII, Borderlands 4 and the much-anticipated Grand Theft Auto VI (GTA VI). Moreover, he expects the company's new console/PC releases to deliver about $2.25 billion in incremental bookings. He anticipates the mobile business will contribute around $3.1 billion, and catalog/live services will generate $2.5 billion in the full year. While management has expressed high confidence in its ability to release GTA VI next year, the analyst thinks that any potential delay between two fiscal years would have a limited impact on TTWO's two-year earnings path. He expects this vital release to generate about $3 billion of bookings in the first year, while enhancing the company's financial flexibility with over $2 billion in free cash flow. "Beyond the next 12-24 months, Take Two should benefit from the long-tail of live services/catalog sales and further depth in the pipeline with sequels to Red Dead, BioShock and Max Payne, and perhaps new 2K sports franchises," said Sebastian. Sebastian ranks No. 286 among more than 9,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 56% of the time, delivering an average return of 12.8%. (See TTWO Ownership Structure on TipRanks) Baird analyst Peter Benedict is bullish on the prospects of membership-only warehouse chain Costco Wholesale (COST). Earlier this month, Costco reported a 7.1% rise in its net sales for the retail month of August (the four weeks ended Sept. 1). Excluding the impact of changes on gasoline prices and foreign exchange, Costco's August comparable sales also grew 7.1%. Benedict noted that the August comparable sales growth was sequentially steady compared to the 7.2% increase in July, as stronger traffic was offset by some moderation in average traffic growth. Benedict increased his Q4 fiscal 2024 EPS estimate to $5.10 compared to the Street's consensus estimate of $5.07 per share to reflect better-than-expected sales in the fiscal quarter. "COST's traction with consumers continues to stand out against an increasingly challenged spending backdrop," said the analyst. Benedict highlighted that the company delivered solid core comparable sales growth yet again and displayed persistent strength in the non-foods area, even as there is continued softness in discretionary categories across most of the retail sector. The analyst thinks that Costco's "growth staple" appeal remains intact, thanks to its consistent performance, store network expansion, encouraging membership key performance indicators and the recently announced fee hike. He reiterated a buy rating on COST stock with a price target of $975. Benedict ranks No. 30 among more than 9,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 71% of the time, delivering an average return of 16.1%. (See COST Options Trading on TipRanks) Streaming giant Netflix (NFLX) is the third pick for this week. Despite macro pressures and intense competition in the streaming space, the company has been able to impress investors with its crackdown on password sharing and the rollout of an ad-supported tier. JPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth contends that while "advertising is not in NFLX's DNA" and the company is creating the ad tier from scratch, it has the ability to emerge as a major ad player as scale and monetization grow in 2025 and beyond. He estimates that ad revenue, excluding the subscriptions component, will account for more than 10% of the company's revenue in 2027. The analyst acknowledges that the scale of Netflix's ad tier currently lags behind that of peers like Amazon, which gained from automatically including its Prime members in its ad-supported tier. That said, he is confident that Netflix can boost its scale by making changes in plans and pricing, bundling offers and providing live content that has extensive appeal. Anmuth further explained that while Netflix's ad tier is dilutive to its overall average revenue per member, the impressive 150% growth in the company's upfront ad sales commitments, greater scale and improved focus on ad formats and ad tech should drive higher monetization. Overall, Anmuth is optimistic about Netflix's ability to grow its top line in the mid-teens this year and in 2025, further improve its margins, and deliver multi-year free cash flow growth. He reaffirmed a buy rating on NFLX stock with a price target of $750. Anmuth ranks No. 99 among more than 9,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 61% of the time, delivering an average return of 17.7%. (See NFLX Financials on TipRanks) Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

Federal Reserve officials will speak this week, providing more insight into their recent decision to reduce interest rates. Friday's release of the August Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index will show whether inflation continues to slow. Investors can expect fresh data on new and pending home sales, along with an update on housing prices, and consumer sentiment surveys. Micron Technology (MU), Costco Wholesale (COST), Accenture (ACN), and more will also report earnings. Monday, Sept. 23 Tuesday, Sept. 24 Wednesday, Sept. 25 Thursday, Sept. 26 Friday, Sept. 27 Following last week’s closely watched Federal Reserve decision to enact a jumbo-sized interest rate cut, investors will hear from Fed officials this week about their impressions of the U.S. economy. Fed Chair Jerome Powell will deliver pre-recorded opening remarks at Thursday’s 2024 U.S. Treasury Market Conference, his first remarks since last week’s press conference. Other notable speakers will deliver remarks at the event, including New York Fed President John Williams, Fed Vice Chair Michael Barr, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, and Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, and Boston Fed President Susan Collins are also scheduled to deliver remarks this week. On Friday, market watchers will likely be focused on the latest inflation data, as the August reading of the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index will show whether price pressures continue to cool. The July PCE reading showed the Fed’s preferred inflation measurement was down to an annual rate of 2.5%, still higher than the central bank’s target. Investors will look for more progress on inflation. KB Home’s earnings report on Tuesday could also provide some insight into the health of the housing market. According to a Bank of America analysis, the Fed’s interest rate decision is likely to drive down mortgage rates and potentially improve homebuilders' performance. Memory chip maker and Nvidia (NVDA) partner Micron Technology will report earnings Wednesday, after Morgan Stanley recently downgraded its stock, warning about the health of the memory chip market. Micron’s report comes after its prior quarter earnings were lower than analysts projected, and its revenue guidance disappointed investors. Costco’s earnings on Thursday follows its recent decision to raise membership fees for the first time in seven years, effective Sept. 1. Analysts are expecting the retailer to report higher year-over-year revenue and profit, with memberships rising to 75 million.

Title: What You Need To Know Ahead of Costco Earnings Thursday

Costco Wholesale (COST) reports fiscal 2024 fourth-quarter earnings after the closing bell Thursday, the warehouse retailer's first report since raising its membership price for the first time in seven years. Costco is projected to report $2.26 billion in net income on just shy of $80 billion in revenue, up from $2.2 billion and $78.9 billion, respectively, a year earlier, according to consensus estimates of analysts compiled by Visible Alpha. Costco's leadership has signaled plans to catch up to rivals who have a larger share of digital sales, as the retailer has lagged in online shopping, Morgan Stanley analysts wrote earlier this month. In last quarter's earnings call, Costco leadership said e-commerce sales grew more than 20% year-over-year as the company has sought to improve its website and app shopping experiences. Costco has worked to make its app faster, and added features like searching the inventory of a nearby warehouse to see if it has a particular item in stock. Morgan Stanley analysts recently raised their price target for Costco shares to $950 from $855, calling it "among the best compounding growth stories in retail," and said they believe Costco's next decade could see digital growth and comparable store sales grow at a higher rate than it averaged before the pandemic. Costco announced in July that it would raise its membership fees for the first time in seven years, effective Sept. 1. The changes won't have an impact on fourth-quarter earnings, but executives may get asked on the earnings call about if they've seen any changes in signups or renewals since the new prices were implemented. The retailer is projected to reach 75 million members in the quarter, up from 71 million a year ago and 74.5 million members in Q3. Costco shares finished Friday just below $907 a share, below its record high above $923 set last month. The shares are up nearly 40% this year.

Alliance Entertainment (AENT), a leader in direct-to-consumer and e-commerce in the entertainment sector, disclosed its financial outcomes for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2024 on [date]. The company reported a decrease in net revenue for Q4 to $236.9 million from $247.1 million the previous year, with a gross profit of $26.9 million. Despite the revenue dip, they saw an improvement in net income and a significant reduction in operating expenses, debt, and inventory levels. Management remains optimistic about future growth, highlighting strategies for cost savings, operational efficiencies, and revenue expansion through acquisitions and exclusive distribution deals. Alliance Entertainment's earnings call revealed a mixed financial performance with declines in revenue but improvements in net income and operational efficiencies. The company's management is confident in their growth strategy, which includes leveraging exclusive distribution rights and pursuing strategic acquisitions to boost revenue. They also anticipate cost savings from operational consolidations and technological investments. With these measures, Alliance Entertainment is positioning itself for a stronger performance in the coming fiscal years. Alliance Entertainment, with a market capitalization of $103.91 million, has been navigating a challenging fiscal period, as reflected in its latest financial results. The company's revenue for the last twelve months as of Q3 2024 stands at $1.11 billion, marking a decline of 5.62% from the previous year. Despite the dip in revenue, the firm's gross profit margin has remained relatively stable at 11.9%. InvestingPro Tips suggest that Alliance Entertainment has had a significant return over the last week, with a 12.83% price total return, and even more impressively, a 44.53% return over the last month. This indicates a recent surge in investor confidence, which may be tied to the company's strategic growth initiatives such as acquisitions and exclusive distribution deals as outlined in their recent earnings call. Moreover, the company's valuation implies a strong free cash flow yield, which could be a sign of underlying financial health and potential for future profitability, as analysts predict the company will be profitable this year. Investors considering Alliance Entertainment should note that the stock generally trades with high price volatility, which could present opportunities for high-reward investments but also carries a greater risk. For those interested in a deeper analysis, there are 10 additional InvestingPro Tips available, offering further insights into the company's performance and investment potential. In summary, while Alliance Entertainment has faced revenue challenges, the company's recent price performance and the potential for improved profitability present an interesting case for investors.

At this time, I will turn the call over to Alliance Entertainment Executive Chairman, Bruce Ogilvie. Bruce Ogilvie: Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased to welcome you to today's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2024 financial results conference call. For those of you that are new to our story, we bring entertainment to you. We are a category leading direct-to-consumer and e-commerce provider for the entertainment industry, serving as the gateway between brands and retailers. With over 325,000 SKUs in stock, we provide the world's largest selection of music, home video movies, video games, gaming, hardware, arcades, collectibles, toys, and consumer electronics. We are a needed supplier for omni retailers in helping them expand their long tail entertainment selection online and putting them on a level playing field with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). We white label all their direct-to-consumer shipments to look like it was shipped by the omni retailer, but it was really shipped by Alliance. We are a trusted omni-channel supplier to retailers and wholesalers worldwide, including Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Amazon, Best Buy (NYSE:BBY), Costco (NASDAQ:COST), Target, Kohls, BJ's, Meyer, plus 2,500 independent music stores and many other retailers. We are a trusted distributor of home entertainment movies for Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS), Paramount, Sony (NYSE:SONY) Pictures, Warner Brothers, the Universal Pictures and others. For video games, video game consoles, retro arcades, controllers, and physical software games. We distribute products for Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Nintendo, Arcade1Up, Activision, Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA), Sega, Ubisoft, Square Enix, and Take-Two (NASDAQ:TTWO). In music for LPs, CDs and YES cassettes. We are a trusted distributor for Universal Music (AS:UMG), Sony Music, Warner Music Group, and every independent music label. For the toys category, for collectibles, we distribute for Funko (NASDAQ:FNKO), Mattel (NASDAQ:MAT), LEGO, Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS), and over 600 other suppliers. Alliance Entertainment is a global leader in the 10 billion physical media industry, and we generate over $1.1 billion in revenue in fiscal 2024 with our team of 654 dedicated employee owners. Our leading position in the industry provides us with unparalleled scale and leveraged and has created significant structural and economic barriers of entry that we believe safeguards our market leadership position. We are a value-added retail distributor with exclusive distribution rights for approximately 150 movie studios and music labels and the film and music industry. Our exclusive distribution licensing deals accounted for over $250 million of our revenue in fiscal 2024. Our extensive portfolio of unique content combined with our deep inventory of long tail selections of the more than 325,000 in stock SKUs enables us to cater to bulk shipments for B2B and direct-to-consumer retailers with a vast selection of products, including a growing number of products unavailable through other distributor competitors. This helps us create sticky relationships with our retailers, and growing these exclusive relationships is a key for us moving forward. We have over 200 online retailers that rely on us to stock the world's largest selection of entertainment products for them, and we shipped to more than 35,000 storefronts reaching 72 countries globally. Importantly, we have a long and proven track record of growth through strategic acquisitions. Over the past 20 years, we successively acquired and integrated a dozen companies allowing us to rapidly enter new markets, expand our product selection, and further diversify our revenue streams. Building Alliance from the ground up into the market leader has provided our team with a deep bench and unrivaled experience, which further strengthens our position as we remain very much aligned with our shareholders, with insiders and employees holding approximately 94% of the outstanding shares of the company. After experiencing a surge in demand during the pandemic, many areas within the physical media market have been normalizing back to the historical growth levels in the high single-digits. Even the CD market has joined the revival with CDs outselling digital albums at a rate of 3 to 1 margin in the first 6 months of the year, according to a mid-year report from the Recording Industry Association of America. As part of our $1.1 billion annual revenue, over $250 million was generated from products for which we are the exclusive distributor. These exclusive deals are managed through our Distribution Solutions, AMPED, Mill Creek and Arcade1Up division, and they have significantly enhanced our market position by providing unique content that deepens relationship with both suppliers and retailers. Distribution Solutions was responsible for $134 million of this revenue in the first fiscal 2024. Distribution Solutions partners with over 60 home video movie studios to manufacture, supply, and market their content. We distribute this exclusive content to major retailers such as Amazon, Walmart, and Target, as well as thousands of other smaller retailers. By leveraging Alliance Entertainment's vast distribution network, this exclusive content creates a strong, sticky relationship with retailers, strengthening ongoing demand. In addition, Distribution Solutions have developed a growing digital distribution business. In fiscal year 2023, we generated $8.4 million in digital revenue, and we have more than doubled that in fiscal 2024 reaching $20 million. On the music side, our AMPED division is a leader in physical distribution of exclusive music content. AMPED works more than 90 exclusive music labels distributing music across major retailers like Amazon, Walmart, Target, as well as over 2,500 independent music stores throughout the U.S. Labels and artists such as Shaboozey, Usher, K-Pop sensation, ATEEZ, can bypass major music suppliers, thus lowering their cost and self-distribute themselves using AMPED for their physical distribution needs because they control their own digital streaming and social media marketing, while maximizing profitability through our extensive brick and mortar and omni retail relationship. K-Pop in particular has become a rapidly growing segment for AMPED, contributing significantly to our sales growth. Our Mill Creek division specializes in exclusive video content licensing from major studios, including Disney, Sony Pictures, Universal, Lionsgate Studios and others. Mill Creek licenses, manufactures and distributes DVDs for these leading studios, enhancing our ability to offer exclusive unique and in demand video content that is sought out by consumers and retailers alike. We are also exclusive North American distributor for Arcade1Up, which licenses and manufactures home arcade consoles with significant market share in the retro gaming space. These include some of the most well recognized arcade games like PAC-MAN, Ms. PAC-MAN, NBA Jam, Mortal Kombat, Golden Tee, and more. The Infinity Game Table even includes a digital version of classic board games, including Hasbro’s Monopoly, Scrabble, Trivial Pursuit, Chutes, Platters, Candy Land, Yahtzee, and many other iconic games. We've had a long history of discipline accredited acquisitions, and I want to take a moment to highlight the strategic acquisitions that have been critical to our gaining leadership position in the entertainment space and our growth overall. By 2013, Jeff and I had built up Super D from $18 million in sales, starting in 2001 to $194 million. Then we made the pivotal move in requiring Alliance Entertainment, our largest competitor, which was doing $725 million in revenue at the time and significantly expanded our footprint, transforming us overnight into the largest distributor of music and video in the world. This acquisition marked our first major step in consolidating the package media categories of music and video. We continue to build on this strategy in 2016 with the acquisition of ANconnect, which gave us exclusive access to sell CDs to Walmart and Best Buy, and expanded our important vendor managing inventory capabilities for our portfolio. Our entry into the gaming space came in 2018 through the acquisition of Mecca enabling us to distribute products from major suppliers like Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo. That same year, we also acquired Distribution Solutions from Sony Pictures, which got us into the exclusive home video distribution relationships with 20 movie studios, further strengthening our position in the industry and giving us another vendor number with Walmart and Best Buy, and enabling us to become the exclusive seller for these movie studios to Walmart, Amazon, Best Buy, Target, Barnes & Noble, and other retailers in the U.S. and Canada. In 2020, we expanded our video gaming presence with the acquisition of Mecca's compare to COKeM, thus expanding our relationship with Best Buy, Target, Kohls, Dell (NYSE:DELL), and Verizon (NYSE:VZ). With the acquisition of COKeM, we also started distributing retro arcade from Arcade1Up, and most recently in 2022, we added collectibles to our portfolio. With the acquisition of Think 3Fold, and move that further diversified our product offering gave us another supplier number with Walmart. As you can see, we have a proven track record of completing acquisitions, and we will continue with that same strategy to further growth and diversify our company moving forward. While we did put ourselves on hold for acquisitions in 2022 and 2023 for our SPAC merger and getting our new three year line of credit in place, we are currently working on four possible future transactions all-in time for our deal pipeline. To better understand what that could mean for Alliance and moving forward, I want to briefly share a case study from our acquisition of Distribution Solutions in 2018. At the time, they were doing around $80 million in revenue working with 18 studios. Fast forward to today, in fiscal 2024, Distribution Solutions accounted for $134 million in revenue, and we're now working with nearly three times the number of studios. As we look at new deals, we continue to apply the same criteria that's worked for us in the past and we're confident this strategy will continue to yield great results. Technology is the backbone of our operations and critical drivers of efficiency, cost savings, and growth. In 2023, we began making strategic investments and automation and technical innovation to enhance our ability to serve our customers more effectively. In January, 2023, we went live with AutoStore automated storage and retrieval system at our Shepherdsville, Kentucky warehouse. I call AutoStore the Rubik’s Cube of auto storage retrieval system. This state-of-the-art system has greatly improved our Kentucky warehouse operations, allowing us to achieve increased levels of speed, reliability, capability, and precision that result in in significant cost savings. With AutoStore, we now process over 2,000 lines per hour with a fraction of the staff. We went from 41 pickers down to seven and receiving went from 14 associates down to eight. Year-over-year, our fulfillment costs are running 1% lower. Because of AutoStore, we eliminated aisles. It created more storage location capacity, enabling us to consolidate operations and close the larger of two buildings in Shakopee, Minnesota, thus removing 162,000 square feet of the 192,000 square feet we had leased there. This closure process, which began in January, was completed on May 31. The savings from this consolidation will positively and permanently impact and reduce our cost structure in fiscal year 2025, further strengthening our ability to operate efficiently and deliver value to our shareholders. In addition, in the Q3 of fiscal 2024, we announced the installation of Sure Sort X system from OPEX, a cutting edge sortation technology that delivered nearly $0.5 million in immediate savings by eliminating need to retrofit older technology and is expected to deliver another nearly $400,000 in annual labor cost savings in our Kentucky facility. In additional cost savings, the Sure X technology has allowed us to handle larger products such as toys and electronics, removing the need for manual sorting and driving new levels of efficiency and precision. In the investor presentation, there are hyperlinks to see AutoStore and OPEX and other processes we do in Kentucky. I will now hand the call over to Alliance's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, Jeff Walker, my partner. Jeff Walker: Thank you, Bruce, and thank you all for joining us today. We will now turn to an overview of our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. We generated $236.9 million in net revenue for the fourth quarter, compared to $247.1 million in the same period last year. While this represents a modest decline, we saw positive shifts in several key areas that position us well for the future. Our gross profit for the fourth quarter was $26.9 million down from $30.2 million in the same quarter last year. This resulted in a gross margin of 11.4%, slightly below the 12.2% achieved in Q4 2023. Although margins tighten, we've taken steps to streamline costs and improve efficiencies, which will be reflected in future quarters. We are pleased to report we delivered net income of $2.5 million for the quarter, a major turnaround from the $4.6 million net loss in the same period last year, an impressive $7.1 million improvement and a clear signal that our focus on operational efficiency is paying off. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter came in at $2.1 million our fifth consecutive quarter of positive adjusted EBITDA. Moving on to our full year highlights. Net revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, were $1.1 billion compared to $1.16 billion for fiscal year 2023. Our shift towards higher margin business, including growth in consumer direct shipments is one factor helping to drive improved margins and profitability. Consumer direct shipments increased to 36% of our gross revenue, up from 31% in fiscal 2023. Gross profit for the fiscal year was $128.9 million compared to $103.9 million in the prior year, an impressive 24% increase. This improvement was driven by the combination of shifting product mix and new operational efficiencies. Gross profit margin also saw a substantial boost rising to 11.7%, up from 9% in fiscal 2023, representing a 270 basis point improvement. In addition to the year-over-year growth in our quarterly gross profit, we achieved a significant $21.9 million reduction in operating expenses. A 16% decrease bringing expenses down from $136.7 million to $114.7 million. This reduction was largely driven by the warehouse efficiencies and new technologies we implemented throughout the year. These improvements are not just one-time gains. They will continue to positively impact our cost structure and overall profitability moving forward. Net income for fiscal 2024 was $4.6 million, a $40 million improvement over the $35.4 million net loss in fiscal 2023, underscoring the effectiveness of our ongoing initiatives to improve margins and manage costs. Our adjusted EBITDA tells a similar story improving by $41.9 million to $24.3 million up from an adjusted EBITDA loss of $17.6 million in fiscal 2023. Net cash provided by operating activities surged to $55.8 million in fiscal 2024, up from $3.4 million in the prior year, a remarkable increase of 1,547%. This cash generation strengthens our ability to reinvest in the business and drive future growth. And just to reiterate something Bruce mentioned earlier, we expect significant cost savings in fiscal 2025 from the closing of our Minnesota facility, which was completed in late May. Over the past year, we've also made significant efforts to strengthen our balance sheet, and those efforts are continuing to bear fruit with both inventory and debt continuing to decline year-over-year. Inventory dropped from $147 million to $97 million as of June 30th, 2024, and debt was reduced from $133 million to $73 million. In conjunction with these initiatives, we've secured a new three-year $120 million senior secured asset-based credit facility with White Oak Commercial Finance earlier this year, the proceeds of which was used to refinance the existing credit facility fund working capital needs, and provide for general corporate purposes. These steps have also positioned us to focus and execute on implementing our acquisition strategy going forward. Taking a broader view of our financial performance over the last five fiscal years. This slide showcases how we've navigated a dynamic environment. In fiscal 2020, we generated $776 million in revenue. Over the next two years, a combination of growth initiatives, strategic acquisitions, and an unprecedented surge in demand during COVID-19 pandemic drove our top line to a peak of $1.4 billion in fiscal 2022. As expected, this demand is normalized with revenues adjusting to around $1.1 billion for fiscal ’23 and ‘24. While adjusted EBITDA in fiscal 2023 was impacted by one time supply chain issues, the significant rebound in fiscal 2024 also reflects the strategic steps we've taken to enhance profitability, including reducing costs and optimizing operations. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 2.2% for fiscal 2024. Turning to our balance sheet. As mentioned a moment ago, our focus on reducing inventory and debt has paid off with inventory levels dropping to $97 million and debt reduced to $73 million as of June 30, 2024. These reductions have streamlined our operations and improved our financial flexibility. As already mentioned, we also expect further cost savings for fiscal 2025, particularly from the closure of our Minnesota facility in May. Additionally, our $120 million asset based credit facility with White Oak, which was secured to support working capital and refinance existing debt, has positioned us well for continued growth and execution of our acquisition strategy going forward. I will now turn the call back over to Bruce. Bruce Ogilvie: Thank you, Jeff. As we look to the future, Alliance Entertainment is poised for continued growth by leveraging our strength as a capital light, low-cost provider with unmatched reach in the industry. Our strategy is clear expand our market share, improve margins, and drive EBITDA growth. First, we see tremendous opportunities to expand into underpenetrated channels, particularly in areas like digital video streaming, where direct vendor selling remains low and cost effective. This is where Alliance can truly shine by offering efficient scalable solution. In fiscal 2024 alone, our exclusive distribution agreement generated over 250 million in sales, and we expect to build on this momentum moving forward. Second, we are investing in automation and restructuring to enhance our operational efficiency. Technologies like AutoStore are already driving significant cost savings, and these improvements will continue to bolster our margins while providing the scalability to capture more market share. Third, mergers and acquisitions remain central to our growth strategy. Through strategic M&A, we plan to rapidly expand our product categories in verticals across music, home video movies, video gaming, toys and collectibles. By doing so, we will not only diversify our offerings, but also strengthen relationships with our major retail partners positioning Alliance for long term success. The opportunities ahead are significant. Family-owned competitors are aging out and large movie studios and companies are looking to sell or license physical media rights. Our capital-light model combined with our proven ability to integrate acquisition sets us apart from the competition. These major movie studios, we lean on Alliance to allow opportunities to license their home video content and allow these major movie studios to focus on their core competency of making movies, exhibiting in theaters, doing premium downloads, and focusing their streaming services. Alliance's core competency is distributing packaged physical media. We are excited about the road ahead, and we're confident that our strategic initiatives will drive future growth and profitability for years to come. With that, I'd like to hand the call back to the operator and begin our question-and-answer session. Operator? Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from [David Levine] with [Critical Research]. Unidentified Analyst: Great results, really impressive, great turnaround, all that stuff. I'm wondering if you would be willing to comment a little bit on, given all the changes that have been made and some of the positive developments that you are seeing in the business, if it's reasonable to expect, say, adjusted EBITDA in the future quarters and coming years to trend something closer to where you were previously, say, in the 4% and 5% range. Jeff Walker: Hello, David, this is Jeff Walker. I'll answer that there for you. We definitely see our EBITDA trending upwards, and we do believe that we can get back into that 4% to 5% EBITDA goal or target that we've been focused on. That ‘24 was still a year of some cleanup as well as consolidation. So we should definitely see that improving as we're moving into fiscal ‘25 and ‘26. Operator: Thank you. There are no further questions in the queue at this time. I would like to pass it back to Paul Kuntz for any web questions from the webcast. Unidentified Company Representative : Thank you, Paul. Now we are going to turn to the questions coming in from the webcast participants. Our first question was, how will interest rate reductions impact the earnings? Jeff Walker: Thank you, Paul. I'll take this one as well here. We expect to see a very big decline in our interest expense for fiscal ‘26 with our continued debt reduction that we are in the process of today, and continuing through fiscal ‘25 and combining that with potential fed interest rate reductions. That should have a pretty significant impact on our interest cost in fiscal ‘25, but a real significant impact for fiscal ‘26 as well. Unidentified Company Representative : Thank you. And our next question, what growth initiatives are Alliance is focused on in fiscal 2025? Jeff Walker: Thank you, Paul. We're really focused intently right now on increasing our exclusive distribution opportunities and video music and collectibles. We definitely mentioned that quite a bit in this statement in our press release here. It's a very important aspect of our business to have the exclusive distribution of products. It really helps us with sales to our retailers and it really drives our business there. We are looking at including, significant video licensing opportunities with our Mill Creek division, and we currently have a significant conversation happening here because of Alliance's extensive distribution capabilities and being great solutions for our partners. So really, our solution has been very successful for the labels and studios that have come to us for exclusive distribution. And part of that is that we have all their inventory in stock and our sales opportunities and sales channels, not only to the brick-and-mortar, but across all e-commerce, selling media products is really our bread-and-butter there for our exclusive vendors, and it's really driving incremental sales for them. Unidentified Company Representative: Thank you. And our next question, collectible sales were down in fiscal 2024. What is the future in them? Jeff Walker: Some of you probably know that are on this call, COVID was fantastic for consumer all consumer products and collectibles were definitely super-hot during COVID with, for retailers, wholesalers, manufacturers. We as it was humming along so well, we all really got severely overstocked, and lots of products had to be marked down and sold through with all the major retailers and wholesalers and manufacturers. I think today, the collectible market is in a much better position today. There's just a small amount of excess products still in the pipeline, but nothing like it was a couple of years ago. And when there's a lot of excess product in the pipeline, it really slows down sales for everybody in the category. So, Alliance was not immune to it. We took hits on those that affected our sales and margins, and we've come through this as well. And if you follow Funko, who is definitely a leader in collectibles, they definitely describe the challenges, and going into 2025, the collectible business is definitely normalizing for them and other manufacturers. I will say that the overall collectible industry is very, very robust. Consumers are still loving to collect their favorite products, and so we see we also see more exclusive distribution opportunities for Alliance in collectibles as well as a lot of great acquisition opportunities in the collectibles space that we're in discussions and will be in our acquisition strategy for years to come. Unidentified Company Representative: Thanks, Jeff. And we had another question. I know you do not provide guidance, but it sounds as if we should be looking for going forward as perhaps limited revenue growth with better gross margins and net margins. Is that a fair assessment? Jeff Walker: Yes, I would say that's a pretty fair assessment. Our overall core business is stable and we might have a small uptick in sales, but really, our growth from overall net revenue is definitely going to come from our acquisition strategy and adding acquisitions to the business. That is how we've grown the company over the last 20 years. And so there's definitely from the acquisition side, we are definitely in some other organic conversations that to bring on some more exclusive distribution, that could drive some growth in our top line revenue. And then, as we mentioned on the call, really continuing to focus on our operational efficiencies will also help to reduce our costs and improve our overall net margins. Unidentified Company Representative : Thank you, Jeff. And we have two related questions to what you're just talking about there. The next one is, can you give any clarity on the offering, filing and your intent to raise cash for future acquisitions? Jeff Walker: Could you repeat that one for me? Unidentified Company Representative : Can you give any clarity on the offering, filing and your intent to raise cash for future acquisitions? Jeff Walker: We did put an S1 filing out earlier this year, and with the intent to raise capital for acquisitions. I think, it's dependent on having a significant acquisition queued up and ready to go. But we're trying to prepare ourselves for all the different options and things that might come our way. Last part on that from an acquisition standpoint, we're very diverse business as we just described. From that diversity that gives us a lot of different acquisition opportunities in all the different categories and divisions and sales channels that we mentioned earlier today. Unidentified Company Representative: Thank you, Jeff. And looks like we have one more question. What is the expected expense reduction in fiscal 2025 from the closing of the Minnesota warehouse? And is there additional reductions planned? Jeff Walker: We acquired COKeM in September of 2020 and we continue to operate their facilities and so forth through there. The lease was coming due in the main warehouse there at the end of May of ‘24 this year. About a year ago, we started our plan to do that consolidation and so in fiscal ‘24, we still ran that warehouse and that operation, so we did not have much savings in fiscal ‘24. The savings is really coming here as we move into fiscal ‘25, and we're forecasting right about $5 million of operational savings for fiscal ‘25. And obviously going forward from that completed consolidation. And a key aspect on it is not just the rent and the payroll, but one of the key aspects is that we were running on COKeM legacy IT system as well. So the company had alliance's system and COKeM system and being able to retire that legacy system at COKeM does save a huge amount of money, not only maintaining systems and as well as IT team and so forth, and compliance issues and all those different things as a public company. So that's where the significant part of that savings is coming from. We do also have a second smaller facility in Minnesota that was across the street from the big one. It's about 30,000 square feet. The lease is up in September of '25, so a year from now, and we will be exiting that one as our lease comes up. So we'll be working on that next summer. It's not as significant of a savings as the big warehouse that we just completed, but it will be some additional savings there. Unidentified Company Representative: Thank you, Jeff. And that was the last question we've had come in. Jeff Walker: Okay. Thank you, everybody. We're very excited. We had a fantastic fiscal year and we're pretty excited here going into fourth quarter and the holiday season. Operator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation. This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor. For more information see our T&C.
