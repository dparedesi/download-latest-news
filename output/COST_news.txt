The latest Pokemon TCG release once again results in empty shelves at release. By Amanda Kay Oaks It feels like only yesterday that people were brawling in Costco over Scarlet and Violet – Prismatic Evolutions Pokemon cards. Yet another popular Pokemon TCG set has arrived, and it’s seeing similar shortage issues to the Eeveelution set. The Pokemon 151: Blooming Waters Premium Collection launched on February 7th alongside the Prismatic Evolutions mini-tins. Both of these are new collections of cards that have already been printed, but clearly, demand for Pokemon 151 and Prismatic Evolutions remains high. This led Pokemon fans and resellers to once again line up at their local Gamestop, with disappointing results. Though no all-out fist fights have made the rounds with this latest release, many fans are sharing the long lines at retailers, particularly GameStop. Once again, there don’t seem to be nearly enough cards to go around as fans attempt to get ahold of even just one Blooming Waters set. In fact, many GameStop locations have reportedly been posting paper signs on their store windows with updates on their stock. And that stock seems suspiciously low, even by Pokemon TCG standards. While some lucky fans have managed to get their hands on the Blooming Waters Premiun Set, plenty of collectors are once again leaving empty handed. Many GameStop locations appeared to have anywhere from just a few to zero of the new Mini Tins, Surprise Boxes, and Blooming Waters sets. This led some fans to wonder if employees weren’t taking advantage of the early access to stock, as many question how stores have so few of the new sets even after the Pokemon Company promised to do better after Prismatic Evolutions. Shortly after the Costco debacle with the last Prismatic Evolutions release, GameStop posted a sassy message on social media. The repost of the viral video included a suggestion that, due to GameStop’s Blooming Waters limit of 2 per customer, their stores were above such issues. We support battling Pokémon, not battling over Pokémon.Blooming Waters arrives at GameStop on February 7th with a 2 per customer limit.Do better, @Costco. https://t.co/CgMXd8MY0E Many fans are thinking back on this post now, as stores seem unable to provide even those two measly boxes for most customers. As one post compiling signs from various GameStop locations reveals, many shops claimed to have only 1 or 2 total boxes of the new Pokemon TCG cards before they even opened. This has led many fans to speculate that employees must be buying up the stock before it hits shelves. Whether or not that’s true, many stores accepted preorders for Blooming Waters and the new additions to the Prismatic Evolutions line. So, it is certainly possible that the shortages are due to the fact that preorders accounted for most of the stock these locations received. Regardless of the cause, collectors are frustrated to once again line up early only to find no Pokemon TCG cards available. Others note the upcharge on stock that is available. The Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for the Blooming Waters Premium Collection. is $59.99. According to customer reports and the current website pricing, GameStop is selling the sets for $10 above that, at $69.99. This isn’t nearly the upcharge we can expect from resellers who nabbed the cards today, but has some customers feeling extra frustrated as the stock shortages and excess cost combine. Unlike with Prismatic Evolutions, The Pokemon Company has not yet issued a statement about the shortage issues for Blooming Waters specifically. They have, however, implemented changes to the Pokemon Center website in an effort to tackle bots and scalpers buying up cards online. Despite this, many fans report being unable to get ahold of the cards on release day. Clearly, the difference in supply and demand will continue to be an issue for Pokemon TCG fans for the foreseeable future. Were you able to get the Prismatic Evolutions or Blooming Waters sets?

Title: ‘I Feel Like a Drug Dealer’: How Beth’s Cafe Sources Eggs for Its 12-Egg Omelets
URL: https://seattle.eater.com/2025/2/7/24360468/egg-prices-at-beths-cafe-12-egg-omelets-seattle

Filed under: The egg shortage has hit the legendary Green Lake diner, where the massive omelets cost as much as $42, particularly hard Beth’s Cafe, on the side of Aurora as you drive through Green Lake, is a battered, venerable diner that for decades has been the place in north Seattle to go when you need to eat after midnight. It’s small, it’s unpretentious, it’s family-friendly, and it has a problem: eggs. As nearly everyone knows by now, an outbreak of bird flu has killed so many chickens that the supply chain has been badly disrupted. Prices have gone up, stores are struggling to keep eggs in stock, and restaurants nationwide are scrambling (pun intended) to navigate the new environment. Some places have changed their menus to de-emphasize eggs while others are charging more — Waffle House now has a 50-cent per-egg surcharge. Among Seattle restaurants, Beth’s is particularly affected by this shortage. It’s famous for its massive, 12-egg omelets, and even its six-egg omelets and three-egg scrambles are heavy on the eggs. The diner goes through 15 to 20 cases of eggs a week, co-owner Mason Reed (who took over Beth’s last year) tells Eater Seattle. A case is 15 dozen eggs, so that means the restaurant cracks open upwards of 3,600 eggs a week, which averages to more than 500 per day. Since the onset of the bird flu, Reed has been stressed about getting enough eggs to meet that demand. Beth’s had been sourcing its eggs from Wilcox Farms, but “lately we’ve had to branch out,” the owner says. Reed and his team have been going to Costco and US Food’s Chef’Store and making calls to anywhere that might have eggs. The prices can vary wildly, and some distributors have limits on how many eggs they can sell. “It’s been a juggling act,” Reed says. “I feel like a drug dealer trying to find my source,” Reed adds. “I’m calling around, going, ‘What’s the price? How many can you offer?’” It’s not just the bird flu causing prices to rise. At the beginning of 2024, a new Washington law required all eggs sold in the state to be cage-free. The price per egg Beth’s was paying jumped from 9 cents to about 27 cents; a case was around $40, Reed says. In the past few months prices have jumped again and now Reed is paying anywhere from $80 to $150 per case, depending on the week. “It just is really turbulent,” says Reed. Menu prices reflect these changes. In 2020, the Triple Bypass version of the 12-egg omelet (with bacon, sausage, ham, and two kinds of cheese) was $22.50, according to the Seattle Times. In 2023, when Beth’s reopened after a temporary closure, the price had ticked up to $34.95. Now that same omelet is $41.95. Reed says he’s raised prices twice since the start of 2024, once to deal with the cost of the cage-free law and once to offset the cost of Seattle’s rising minimum wage. “Beth’s is famous for their big omelets, it’s not something I want to get rid of,” Reed says. But he is contemplating menu changes. Reed says the restaurant may try to have more non-egg options, including tofu scrambles, and offer smaller portions for under $15. “We’re trying our best to keep prices as low as possible,” he says. Beth’s may offer $42 omelets for the wannabe competitive eaters out there, but at its core it’s a diner that’s supposed to serve affordable, filling food to families and working people. At least Reed has found a stable source of eggs, for now. “They’re a lot more than they were, but [the price] is not going up,” he says. His new supplier is a California-based company called Alderwood Eggs, but he hesitates to throw that name around. “I don’t want to put it out there because I don’t want everyone to buy all my eggs.” Sign up for our newsletter.

Title: Why CFOs Need To Control Prices In A Disrupted Economy
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/cfo/2025/02/04/why-cfos-need-to-control-prices-in-a-disrupted-economy/
Time Published: 2025-02-04T17:18:41Z

The whipsawing news about tariffs and trade wars during the last few days has caused confusion, quick calculations and frantic negotiations between global business partners. However, according to BCG’s most recent Executive Perspectives study, 85% of businesses have been preparing for this eventuality since Donald Trump won the presidential election in November, and more than 60% of executives have increased concerns about tariffs. Does that mean they’re ready for all that’s been going on? Not exactly. The study found that two in five executives feel unprepared for this latest round of market shocks, despite the previous five years characterized by market shocks: the Covid-19 pandemic, supply chain issues, war in Ukraine and the Middle East and high inflation. The balance of executives’ outlook toward market stability has also shifted this year. In North America, just 29% are optimists—a drop of 6% from 2024—while 19% are pessimists—an increase of 4% from last year. Business leaders’ financial mettle has been tested vigorously over the last few days with a raft of announcements about tariffs. On Friday, President Trump said he was enacting his first set of tariffs, which were to go into effect today: 25% on imports from Mexico and Canada, and 10% on China. Global markets dropped, and leaders went into negotiating mode. By the end of the day Monday, tariffs on Mexico and Canada were postponed for 30 days—Mexico promised to deploy 10,000 Mexican soldiers to the border to prevent drug trafficking, and Canada is spending $1.3 billion on a joint task force designed to combat fentanyl, organized crime and money laundering. China’s tariffs are beginning as planned, with the Asian nation placing retaliatory 15% tariffs on several American-made goods, as well as U.S. companies. This type of news is difficult to keep up with, let alone use to forecast your business plans. And while many companies prepared for potential tariffs on China last year, steep tariffs on Mexico and Canada weren’t in many companies’ viewfinders. Forbes senior contributor Michael Lynch writes that how Trump appears to be using tariffs so far—as a threat unless other countries do something the United States wants—makes it especially difficult for U.S. businesses. The tariffs are largely unrelated to business outcomes. Even without the open question of tariffs, the U.S. economy is in a volatile situation right now, as quick decisions have far reverberations. Stephan Liozu, chief value officer at financial software company Zilliant, says that companies can do much better if CFOs have a handle on pricing and can make quick changes to respond to the larger economic situation. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell speaks after last week's Open Market Committee meeting. The seesawing news on tariffs rocked the markets this week. In the U.S., all markets fell on Monday morning, but recovered slightly after Trump announced the pause on Mexico’s tariffs. However, the three major indexes closed down—the Dow down 0.3%, the S&P lost 0.8% and the Nasdaq minus 1.2%. The pause on Canada’s tariffs was announced after markets closed on Monday, and stocks slowly moved toward a recovery. But tariffs are far from the only decision of the last week that’s shaped the economic picture. Last week the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee decided to hold interest rates steady at 4.25% to 4.5%. It was the first meeting since July at which rates were not cut. In the announcement, the committee noted unemployment “has stabilized at a low level” and “inflation remains somewhat elevated.” Trump responded to the Fed’s decision with a Truth Social post saying the body “has done a terrible job on Bank Regulation. But Forbes senior contributor Simon Moore notes that tariffs tend to be paid for by consumers and U.S. companies in terms of higher prices, potentially increasing inflation—and therefore lowering the chances of additional rate cuts. Inflation and economic stagnation are persisting. Commerce Department data released on Friday showed that inflation remained sticky, with the personal consumption expenditures index at 2.6% in December. GDP only rose 2.3% in the fourth quarter, slower than expected. President Donald Trump, between Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent at left and Commerce Secretary nominee Howard Lutnick, speaks to the press as he signs an executive order to create a U.S. sovereign wealth fund. New policy choices are also potentially reshaping the U.S.’s financial picture. On Monday, President Trump signed an executive order establishing a U.S. sovereign wealth fund—a state-owned fund that can invest in stocks, real estate, bonds, hedge funds and more that can insulate the government from economic stress. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said it would be set up in the next 12 months, though it’s unclear where the money will come from. Trump said that perhaps TikTok could be put into this sovereign fund “if we make the right deal.” In his first week in office, Trump signed an order to create a working group on cryptocurrency, potentially creating a national digital asset stockpile, wrote Forbes senior contributor Jason Brett. Trump has been interested in cryptocurrency throughout his campaign, with his family creating the World Liberty Financial crypto venture last year, and $TRUMP and $MELANIA meme coins issued right before the inauguration. Former Forbes staffer Steven Ehrlich talked to former chair of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission Timothy Massad about Trump’s crypto ventures. Massad said it’s good that the administration is focusing on digital assets and is hopeful it will lead to a framework encouraging responsible development of the tech, but he sees no need for a strategic crypto reserve. A Costco Wholesale store in Chicago. Polling has shown that recent union success has increased the number of Americans who like them, with workers unions receiving a 70% approval rating on a Gallup poll, writes Forbes senior contributor Teresa Ghilarducci. According to the Labor Department, 9.9% of the workforce was in a union in 2024, down slightly from 10% the year prior. But organized labor may face an uncertain future. Last week, Trump fired Democrat National Labor Relations Board member Gwynne Wilcox, leaving the board with just two members and unable to conduct business. Her dismissal may be challenged in court. In the last week, organized labor had earned some big wins. Costco reached a last-minute tentative contract agreement with about 18,000 employees in the International Brotherhood of Teamsters union, averting a strike that would have started over the weekend, affecting more than 50 Costco locations nationwide, writes Forbes senior contributor Pamela Danziger. Employees at a Philadelphia Whole Foods location also voted last week to join the United Food and Commercial Workers union, Danziger writes. The next step is for the union to negotiate a contract with the grocery chain’s owner, Amazon, which has just one unionized warehouse under its flagship business. Zilliant Chief Value Officer Stephan Liozu. From the looks of it, price management software Zilliant Chief Value Officer Stephan Liozu believes we’re entering a period of hyperinflation, with costs going up and down all the time. For companies to perform better in times like this, he said CFOs need to have a better handle on and control of pricing—something that four in five companies don’t have a team dedicated to looking at. I talked to him about how companies should look at prices and plan for an uncertain future. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. How should prices be set? Liozu: I recommend the three Cs of pricing. You have to know your cost inside and out, and now the cost is changing on a minute[-by-minute] basis. That’s very dynamic and includes goods coming from outside, inside. The second C is competition. You need to anticipate what your competitors are going to do. How are we going to manage that hybrid inflation and tariffs? Are we going to do it better than you? Are they going to raise or decrease prices, et cetera? Then you have customer value. Right now, the perceptions of value are changing, and that means that you need to be aware that they might consider your offers, your product or services differently. The three Cs are in play constantly, and these three Cs are informing smart pricing decisions. Unfortunately, most companies will look at cost only, especially in periods of stagflation and inflation, but they need to really anticipate what competition is going to do and also the perceptions of value from consumers. What advice would you give to CFOs today that are trying to figure all this out? Number one is to take ownership of pricing. If no one is doing it and you don’t have a pricing team, create a task force, create a council and make sure you bring all these parties at the table, and say: OK, we’re going to do this better in a dynamic way, and with the right data. Number two is look at how pricing is managed, how long it takes you to do updates. Make a case for better investment in faster systems [for] optimization, automation. It pays for itself in six months when you look at money you save on not giving the right price to the market. Number three, I would say rethink your strategy with the three Cs. Most CFOs will go and focus on cost cutting, cost optimization and doing the calculations. Don’t forget competition and value because there is still a lot of value that can be captured from customers. There are a lot of strategies you could do in products and services to increase the value for the price. We’ve been in a period of disruption for a long time—the Covid-19 pandemic, supply chain issues, war in Ukraine and the Middle East, and high inflation. But when things finally settle down again, do you think this focus on dynamic pricing will stay? Right now, disruption is the new constant. Based on how things are right now with China, Russia and trends around the world, we’re going to see ongoing disruption for the next 10 to 20 years. Which means you need to be automating, you need to have dynamic processes and systems, and you need to adapt your DNA to this kind of environment. If your company’s not prepared for that type of change, then you’re going to disappear. The CFO needs to raise that flag in the C-suite, but also has the responsibility to make sure on the side of risk management, this is managed internally. Because shareholders are going to look at this, and say, what are you doing? Generative AI company OpenAI is reportedly in discussions for a funding round that could double its value, the Wall Street Journal wrote last week. $40 billion: Amount OpenAI is reportedly raising now $340 billion: Value of the company if it completes that funding round. OpenAI’s latest valuation is $157 billion ‘We’re only getting started’: OpenAI said in the statement announcing its $6.6 billion funding round last October Most companies are looking to optimize costs, and this is best accomplished by using technology. Here’s what you can do by using tech and data for this task. Large companies are full of diverse cultures: in different offices, departments and countries. Here are some tips to work well with all of them. In Monday’s stock selloff fueled by panic around potential U.S. tariffs, which large company saw its stock fall by the biggest percentage? A.
