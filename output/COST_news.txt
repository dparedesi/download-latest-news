December 08, 2025 16:05 ET | Source: Mama’s Creations, Inc. Mama’s Creations, Inc. Revenues Grow 50% YoY to $47.3 Million, Driven by Double-Digit Organic Sales Momentum and Integration of Crown 1 Asset Acquisition EAST RUTHERFORD, NJ, Dec. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mama’s Creations, Inc. (Nasdaq: MAMA), a leading national marketer and manufacturer of fresh deli prepared foods, has reported its financial results for the third quarter ended October 31, 2025. Financial Summary: Third Quarter Fiscal 2026 & Subsequent Operational Highlights: Management Commentary Adam L. Michaels, Chairman and CEO of Mama’s Creations, said: “Our third quarter demonstrated meaningful momentum in scaling the business. With the integration of the business of Crown 1 underway, we delivered broad-based growth across our protein portfolio, deployed high-return trade and marketing investments, leveraging newly added retail doors and cross-selling. We also implemented targeted price increases across both our beef and chicken portfolios to help offset commodity headwinds, while improvements in chicken operations enhanced throughput and lowered overtime, helping us meet our margin objectives. “With the acquisition of Crown 1’s assets, we began a straightforward integration supported by proximity and shared grill platforms. Crown’s initially lower gross margins weighed on the quarter, but we are executing a clear plan to lift the acquired Bay Shore facility’s margin performance through procurement scale, throughput and overhead efficiencies, shared services, and best-practice sharing – which we expect to lift consolidated corporate gross margins from the low-20% range to the mid-20% range over the next year. “We continue to see strong sales momentum across the portfolio, with Crown opening access to hard-to-penetrate customers and creating new cross-sell channels using its premium product offerings, while expanding SKU penetration across its base remains a core priority. This traction is reinforced by new tier-one wins at Target and Food Lion; at Target, we expect first shipments to begin in February, while our products should hit Food Lion’s shelves this month. This, paired with our ongoing National Costco collaboration, positions us for significant growth in the coming quarters. “As we look ahead, our strategic path toward becoming a $1 billion deli prepared foods company is becoming even clearer. We continue to manage our balance sheet conservatively and maintain strict discipline around capital allocation, prioritizing integration ahead of a new acquisition. With expanded capacity, access to premium retail accounts and ongoing grandma-quality innovation, we are well-positioned to drive sustained profitable growth and improved margins in the quarters to come,” concluded Michaels. Third Quarter Fiscal 2026 Financial Results Revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2026 increased 50.0% to $47.3 million, as compared to $31.5 million in the same year-ago quarter. The increase was attributable to both the acquisition of the Crown 1 business, as well as robust double-digit growth in the core business on a pre-acquisition basis. Gross profit increased 56.6% to $11.1 million, or 23.6% of total revenues, in the third quarter of fiscal 2026, as compared to $7.1 million, or 22.6% of total revenues, in the same year-ago quarter. The increase in gross margin rate was primarily attributable to operational efficiency improvements across the organization and stabilized chicken commodity prices, partially offset by higher beef commodity prices as well as the addition of lower-margin Crown 1 sales, which the Company expects to bring in-line with the corporate average in the mid-20% range over the next year. Operating expenses totaled $10.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2026, as compared to $6.6 million in the same year-ago quarter. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses increased in the third quarter fiscal 2026 to 21.8% from 20.8%. Operating expenses in the third quarter were impacted by the acquisition of the Crown 1 business, as well as $1.0 million in non-recurring professional fees and transaction expenses related to the acquisition. Excluding the aforementioned acquisition-related expenses, operating expenses remained below 20% of revenue. Net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2026 increased 31.7% to $0.5 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $0.4 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, in the same year-ago quarter. Third quarter net income totaled 1.1% of revenue, as compared to 1.3% in the same year-ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, increased 118.0% to $3.8 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2026, as compared to $1.7 million in the same year-ago quarter. Cash and cash equivalents as of October 31, 2025, grew to $18.1 million, as compared to $7.2 million as of January 31, 2025, primarily driven by improved profitability, ongoing working capital optimization and the private placement completed concurrent with the acquisition of the Crown 1 business. As of October 31, 2025, total debt stood at $6.4 million, as compared to $6.3 million as of October 31, 2024. Conference Call Management will host an investor conference call at 4:30 p.m. Eastern time on Monday, December 8, 2025 to discuss the Company’s third quarter fiscal 2026 financial results, provide a corporate update, and conclude with Q&A from telephone participants.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures This press release includes the following non-GAAP measure – adjusted EBITDA, which is not a measure of financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as a measure of financial performance. The company believes this non-GAAP measure, when considered together with the corresponding GAAP measures, provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to the company’s results of operations. However, this non-GAAP measure has significant limitations in that it does not reflect all the costs and other items associated with the operation of the company’s business as determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the company’s non-GAAP measures may be calculated differently and are therefore not comparable to similar measures by other companies. Therefore, investors should consider non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance in accordance with GAAP.

Title: Yep, Xbox Is Bleeding Out

Reading time 3 minutes Like the worst sort of father, Xbox doesnât show much care for its youngest consoles anymore, at least judging solely by recent sales data. Black Friday weekend, normally one of the most important for any brand for pre-holiday sales, shows Xbox got beat out by Nintendo, Sony, andâto give the news an ounce of ironyâeven a relatively obscure Kinect-like console. Mat Piscatella, a video game industry analyst at Circana, reported that the PlayStation 5 accounted for 47% of total Black Friday week console sales, in the U.S. ending Nov. 29. That makes sense, considering the console was on sale for about 40% at some retailers. Sony’s consoleâboth the digital version and one with a disc driveâwas on sale for less than even its pre-hike price. Meanwhile, coming up second was the Nintendo Switch 2 at 24% of total sales. The second-generation handheld console was on sale for $50 off the normally $500 Mario Kart World bundle from Walmart and Amazon. Finally, coming in third was the NEX Playground at 14%. See Xbox Series X and S at Amazon In the US, PlayStation 5 accounted for 47% of total Black Friday week hardware unit sales, leading the market. Nintendo Switch 2 ranked 2nd (24%), with the NEX Playground 3rd (14%). Source: Circana Retail Tracking Service [image or embed] â Mat Piscatella (@matpiscatella.bsky.social) December 6, 2025 at 3:37 PM Whatâs the NEX Playground, you may ask? Itâs an Android-based platform made for younger children. It includes motion sensors that can read body movements for games such as Fruit Ninja or tie-in titles like How to Train Your Dragon: Riders of the Skies. Yes, that’s very much like the long-defunct Kinect. Itâs a very specific kind of console that may make sense for budget-conscious families. Whatâs missing from this pie chart is the Xbox Series S and Series X. Microsoft pushed no sales for its consoles during Black Friday week. Even if some retailers went out of their way to move stock with extra gift cards or game sales, Xbox itself wasnât helping push the needle. The current Xbox Series X costs $650 after this yearâs latest price hike. The same console cost $500 at launch in 2020. Piscatella wrote on Bluesky, âStuff that does not price promote (generally speaking, here) does not see much of a seasonal lift at all from the prior week (usually none).â Since the PS5 was the most heavily discounted, it received the lionâs share of additional sales. Xbox either did not think it was necessary to push sales, or the brand just doesnât care anymore. Xboxâs whole strategy is now focused on software. If it does finally release a next-gen Xbox, it will likely be a premium, expensive gaming device made for players who want the very best. That means the Xbox Series consoles donât really have a place anymore. There have been signs that Xbox has been shipping far fewer consoles to retailers, such that Costco removed the companyâs consoles from its U.S. and UK websites. The move toward a software-based gaming ecosystem is inevitably disappointing for Xbox fans. At the same time, the cost of RAM and SSD memory blew past the point of reason several weeks ago, and it keeps getting worse. Burgeoning AI data centers are willing to pay so much for memory that semiconductor companies have created a drought of consumer-ready DRAM (dynamic random access memory). The reliable leaker Mooreâs Law is Dead reported Sony stockpiled enough memory for the short term, but the RAM shortage could last through 2028. Yes, RAM prices could still be out of control a few years from now. Meanwhile, Xboxâs cloud gaming service has reportedly seen an uptick in total usage hours lately. Whether that means there are more people buying into Game Pass is another question entirely. Microsoft hasnât been willing to share total subscriber numbers recently. Thereâs a chance Microsoftâs strategy will win out over the traditionalists like Sony and Nintendo. But for now, its console business is bleeding out so fast, it likely wonât last long. And things aren’t going to get easier for Xbox. Valve is launching its Steam Machine in early 2026 and there will no doubt be all kinds of third-party console-sized PCs of the same ilk.Â When the next-gen Xbox does arrive, it won’t be a battle directly with Sony’s “PS6.” The console wars will have changed by then, with more players fighting for the living room than ever before.
