You might know Dollar Tree stores are small for a good reason — it helps the company keep operating costs down. The stores then pass those savings on to consumers in the form of lower prices in hopes of keeping their shoppers coming back. Although the quality of some dollar store products is questionable, you can find some legitimately good deals if you know what to look for. Considering Americans' spending on Christmas and the holidays is expected to exceed $890 per person in 2025, according to the National Retail Foundation, cutting corners where you can isn't a bad idea. Save some money now by doing a bit of early holiday shopping at your local Dollar Tree. We've put together a list of the best deals at Dollar Tree for the month of October, all of which cost $5 or less per item. You can also shop online at Dollar Tree's website, though you may have to purchase some of these items in bulk which could drive up the total price. But if you have a Dollar Tree nearby, keep reading for the best ways to save. After the excitement of Halloween ends, all the candy is consumed, and the weather starts to turn cooler, kids might need some quieter activities they can do indoors. The Crayola Children's Painting Kit features a character's outline on a sheet of paper. The child can then use the included containers of watercolor paint to color the drawing. Each kit costs $1.75 at Dollar Tree. If you order online, you'll have to buy 20 kits for $35, which could make them a solid party favor or stocking stuffer for all the young kids in your life. The characters featured in the kits are all well-known figures from Disney and Marvel, including Stitch, Minnie Mouse, Spider-Man, and Super Kitties, so there's a good chance the kids will be excited to see them. Each kit contains a brush and four small paint containers, and the colors included depend on the selected character. Minnie Mouse has light yellow, light green, light pink, and hot pink paints, while Stitch has blue, yellow, red, and white paint containers. The instructions also reveal how you can make even more colors by mixing paints. Each kit is recommended for children ages 4 and higher. Whether you like wearing low-cut socks for physical activities or as a simple finishing touch on a formal outfit, you might appreciate having them on hand in significant quantities. When you have low-cut socks in abundance, you don't have to worry as much about getting caught short if your only pair wears thin or ends up with holes. Dollar Tree can help you build out your collection with a pack of 20 Women's Black Athletic Low-Cut Socks (10 pairs) that cost $3 per pack (or 30 cents per pair). If you buy them online, you'll have to buy a quantity of 12 packs — or 120 pairs — which will set you up for quite a while. The socks are made for women with shoe sizes between 5 and 9. Each sock consists of 98% polyester and 2% spandex. "They're thin, breathable, [and] washable athletic socks," said one Dollar Tree reviewer who buys the socks for their own use and donates them to food banks. Some Dollar Tree kitchen items are so affordable, you might not believe the savings. Even better, you can actually buy some well-known household brand name kitchen products at Dollar Tree. One such item that is both inexpensive and features a brand name is the Rubbermaid TakeAlongs Storage Bowls With Lids, which cost $1.50 for a pack of two bowls and lids. If you buy them online, you'll have to purchase a minimum of 12 packs, getting you 24 bowls and lids total, for $18. Each container can hold about three cups of food, which is perfect for sharing cookies and other holiday goodies with neighbors and friends without overdoing it. The container uses transparent plastic with a red lid. Rubbermaid is well-known for having reusable glass and plastic food containers, some of which are made for dozens of uses. You can wash and reuse these TakeAlongs products, too, but they'll need replacing if they show signs of visible wear. According to Dollar Tree's website, they are BPA-free, and safe to put in the microwave and dishwasher. If you're tired of the various marks and scratches that show up in plastic cutting boards, you may want to consider switching to a more durable, sustainable material. Bamboo cutting boards deliver this benefit, serving as a renewable material with a slightly rustic look to class up your kitchen. Bamboo is considered a renewable resource because it is a woody grass that multiplies and grows quickly, unlike trees. Cooking Concepts Bamboo Cutting Boards cost $1.25 apiece at Dollar Tree. And while online shoppers will need to buy a minimum of 24 boards, that still comes out to just $30. Each board measures 6.7 by 9.8 inches, which is large enough to chop all kinds of food while small enough to fit easily in a drawer or cupboard. While they're not dishwasher safe, they are versatile: In addition to making a great chopping surface, they also make the perfect platform for serving hors d'oeuvres. One Dollar Tree customer even used a laser machine to cut words and graphics into the surface to give them as custom gifts. If you love the idea of giving homemade gifts at the holidays, Dollar Tree and other dollar stores can give you a bargain on the starting point for the materials for many different craft projects. For many people, creating DIY snow globes is a favorite crafty holiday tradition. In addition to using them as homemade, personalized gifts, you can use the snow globes for affordable decorations around your house. With winter fast approaching, why not start on these projects a couple of months before the holidays arrive? Although some people use mason jars with lids to create homemade snow globes, Dollar Tree has products available that give you the traditional globe shape and the base to hold the globe upright. Dollar Tree's DIY Customizable Holiday Snow Globe Decorations cost $1.50 each. If you're shopping online, you'll have to buy 24 of them for a total of $36, and each clear globe measures almost 4 inches in diameter. When the base is attached, the unit measures 4.25 inches in height. Then, all you need is glitter, glycerine, water, and some tiny figurines to create the snow globe of your dreams. "Great for what I need it for," says one Dollar Tree customer reviewer. "Just the right size and not cheaply made."

by Michael Levanduski TikTok, Shutterstock TikTok, Shutterstock Everyone knows about inflation, and shrinkflation, and a dozen other ways that big companies are trying to boost their profits. This TikToker is shining a light on a whole new method that has been called ‘trickflation,’ and I’m sure you’ve seen it before. He starts his video by saying, “There’s an exciting new way that you’re being ripped off at the grocery store! You’ve, of course, heard of shrinkflation, where manufacturers take an existing product and just shrink it a little bit. Without applying that same shrinkage to the price. You might have even heard of skimpflation, where companies keep the size and the price the same, but just switch out those pesky expensive ingredients for much cheaper ones.” It is a never-ending battle trying to save money. TikTok/earlypete He then introduces the next way they try to get you, “But the new way the grocery industry has tried to screw us is what one Reddit user calls trickflation. You see, they haven’t reduced the amount of soda. Both of these cans are still 12oz. But since the grocery industry thinks the average consumer has the intelligence of a six-year-old child, they’ve put that same 12oz of soda in what looks like a larger can.” Why am I not surprised? Make people think they are getting more when they actually aren’t. TikTok/earlypete He continues, “No, of course, this trickflation only works if they eliminate the previous can, and jack up the price. Which is, of course, exactly what they did.” Great, so it is basically just raising prices with extra steps. TikTok/earlypete He finishes his video by saying, “So, not only do we have to worry about our products shrinking in size, or using ingredients of much lower quality, but we now have to worry about what is almost indisputably deceptive behavior.” They will do anything to keep their profit margins up. Hopefully, people will wise up to this and start shopping with companies that don’t do this type of thing. But I doubt it. Watch the full video below to see what you think. If it didn’t make me so angry, I would honestly be impressed with the creativity the grocery industry comes up with to rip us off #foodfacts#groceryhaul#exposed ♬ In The Hall Of The Mountain King/Grieg – もつ The people in the comments totally support this video. Check them out for yourself. This commenter says those cans actually cost more, too. I mean, this person isn’t wrong. Oh yes, a classic. Just keep paying more, you’ll keep getting less. If you liked that story, check out this one about a Costco customer who got their cart stolen… so she hatched a plan to get it back!
