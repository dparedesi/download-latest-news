By Claire Sibonney, KFF Health News Ali Foley Shenk still remembers the panic when her 10-year-old son, Dean, finished a 20-ounce box of raisins in the seconds the cupboard was left unlocked. They rushed to the emergency room, fearing a dangerous bowel impaction. The irony stung: When Dean was born, he was so weak and floppy he survived only with feeding tubes because he couldn’t suck or swallow. He was diagnosed as a baby with Prader-Willi syndrome — a rare disorder sparked by a genetic abnormality. He continued to be disinterested in food for years. But doctors warned that as Dean grew, his hunger would eventually become so uncontrollable he could gain dangerous amounts of weight and even eat until his stomach ruptured. “It’s crazy,” said Foley Shenk, who lives in Richmond, Virginia. “All of a sudden, they flip.” Prader-Willi syndrome affects up to 20,000 people in the U.S. The most striking symptom is its most life-threatening: an insatiable hunger known as hyperphagia that prompts caregivers to padlock cupboards and fridges, chain garbage cans and install cameras. Until recently, the only treatment was growth hormone therapy to help patients stay leaner and grow taller, but it didn’t address appetite. In March, the Food and Drug Administration approved Vykat XR, an extended-release version of the existing drug diazoxide choline, which eases the relentless hunger and may offer insights into the biology of extreme appetite and binge eating. This breakthrough for these patients comes as other drugs are revolutionizing how doctors treat obesity, which affects more than 40% of American adults. GLP-1 agonist medications Ozempic, Wegovy and others also are delivering dramatic results for millions. But what’s becoming clear is that obesity isn’t one disease — it’s many, said Jack Yanovski, a senior obesity researcher at the National Institutes of Health, who co-authored some of the Vykat XR studies. Researchers are learning that obesity’s drivers can be environmental, familial or genetic. “It only makes sense that it’s complex to treat,” Yanovski said. Obesity medicine is likely heading the way of treatments for high blood pressure or diabetes, with three to five effective options for different types of patients. For example, up to 15% of patients in the GLP-1 trials didn’t respond to those drugs, and at least one study found the medications didn’t significantly help Prader-Willi patients. Yet, researchers say, efforts to understand how to treat obesity’s many causes and pathways are now in question as the Trump administration is dismantling the nation’s infrastructure for medical discovery. While Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. promotes a “Make America Healthy Again” agenda centered on diet and lifestyle, federal funding for health research is being slashed, including some grants that support the study of obesity. University labs face cuts, FDA staffers are being laid off en masse, and rare disease researchers fear the ripple effects across all medical advances. Even with biotech partnerships — such as the work that led to Vykat XR — progress depends on NIH-funded labs and university researchers. “That whole thing is likely to get disrupted now,” said Theresa Strong, research director for the Foundation for Prader-Willi Research. HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said in a statement that no NIH awards for Prader-Willi syndrome research have been cut. “We remain committed to supporting critical research into rare diseases and genetic conditions,” he said. But Strong said that already some of the contacts at the FDA she’d spent nearly 15 years educating about the disorder have left the agency. She’s heard that some research groups are considering moving their labs to Europe. Early progress in hunger and obesity research is transforming the life of Dean Shenk. During the trial for Vykat XR, his anxiety about food eased so much that his parents began leaving cupboards unlocked. Jennifer Miller, a pediatric endocrinologist at the University of Florida who co-led the Vykat XR trials, treats around 600 Prader-Willi patients, including Dean. She said the impact she’s seen is life-changing. Since the drug trial started in 2018, some of her adult patients have begun living independently, getting into college, and starting jobs — milestones that once felt impossible. “It opens up their world in so many ways.” Over 26 years in practice, she’s also seen just how severely the disease hurts patients. One patient ate a four-pound bag of dehydrated potato flakes; another ingested all 10 frozen pizzas from a Costco pack; some ate pet food. Others have climbed out of windows, dived into dumpsters, even died after being hit by a car while running away from home in search of food. Low muscle tone, developmental delays, cognitive disabilities and behavioral challenges are also common features of the disorder. Dean attends a special education program, his mother said. He also has narcolepsy and cataplexy — a sudden loss of muscle control triggered by strong emotions. His once-regular meltdowns and skin-picking, which led to deep, infected lesions, were tied to anxiety over his obsessive, almost painful urge to eat. In the trial, though, his hyperphagia was under control, according to Miller and Dean’s mother. His lean muscle mass quadrupled, his body fat went down, and his bone mineral density increased. Even the skin-picking stopped, Foley Shenk said. Vykat XR is not a cure for the disease. Instead, it calms overactive neurons in the hypothalamus that release neuropeptide Y — one of the body’s strongest hunger signals. “In most people, if you stop secreting NPY, hunger goes away,” said Anish Bhatnagar, CEO of Soleno Therapeutics, which makes the medication, the company’s first drug. “In Prader-Willi, that off switch doesn’t exist. It’s literally your brain telling you, ‘You’re starving,’ as you eat.” GLP-1 drugs, by contrast, mimic a gut hormone that helps people feel full by slowing digestion and signaling satiety to the brain. Vykat XR’s possible side effects include high blood sugar, increased hair growth and fluid retention or swelling, but those are trade-offs that many patients are willing to make to get some relief from the most devastating symptom of the condition. Still, the drug’s average price of $466,200 a year is staggering even for rare-disease treatments. Soleno said in a statement it expects broad coverage from both private and public insurers and that the co-payments will be “minimal.” Until more insurers start reimbursing the cost, the company is providing the drug free of charge to trial participants. Soleno’s stock soared 40% after the FDA nod and has held fairly steady since, with the company valued at nearly $4 billion as of early June. While Vykat XR may be limited in whom it can help with appetite control, obesity researchers are hoping the research behind it may help them decode the complexity of hunger and identify other treatment options. “Understanding how more targeted therapies work in rare genetic obesity helps us better understand the brain pathways behind appetite,” said Jesse Richards, an internal medicine physician and the director of obesity medicine at the University of Oklahoma-Tulsa’s School of Community Medicine. That future may already be taking shape. For Prader-Willi, two other notable phase 3 clinical trials are underway, led by Acadia Pharmaceuticals and Aardvark Therapeutics, each targeting different pathways. Meanwhile, hundreds of trials for general obesity are currently recruiting despite the uncertainties in U.S. medical research funding. That brings more hope to patients like Dean. Nearly six years after starting treatment, the now-16-year-old is a calmer, happier kid, his mom said. He’s more social, has friends, and can focus better in school. With the impulse to overeat no longer dominating his every thought, he has space for other interests — “Star Wars,” “American Ninja Warrior” and a healthy appreciation for avocados among them. “Before the drug, it just felt like a dead end. My child was miserable,” Foley Shenk said. “Now, we have our son back.” ©2025 KFF Health News. Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

Title: Narwal Freo Z10 Robot Vacuum — Australian Review

I’m lazy. I quite like doing as little as possible that resembles a “chore”, and yet, I enjoy living in a nice, clean, tidy space. You might think these two attributes are at odds with each other, and in a way, they are … however not entirely. Even a lazy person can have a moderately clean space with a little bit of help, and that’s precisely what Narwal’s Freo Z10 robot vacuum offers me. A little bit of help… and it goes a long way. In a nutshell, the Narwal Freo Z10 is a robot vacuum and mop system. Superficially, it presents the same aesthetic that robot vacuums have since their inception – little round discs that float around your house, vacuuming up dust, hair, crumbs and whatever else. However, there are some marked differences between the Freo Z10 and most other robot vacuums I’ve seen, and they really set it apart. For starters: This last point is one I’d like to dwell on. Anyone – and I do mean anyone – who’s had a robot vac or a Dyson stick vac or anything similar, anything with a roller, knows what an absolutely disgusting job it is to remove hair from the roller brush. Even if there are no people with long hair in your house, somehow, your vacuum will get gummed up with long hair within a few days and removing it is gross. Sometimes it comes away easily, other times you need a knife or scissors to pry it off. With Freo Z10’s DualFlow Tangle Free System, you can literally forget about this. Its three-step system will remove the long hair from your place every time, and you’ll never have to cut it out of your vacuum. Its clever sweeper arms can fold into different shapes when it detects a hair tangle, and it spins them down to the roller which effortlessly sucks the hair off and into the dustbin. I think the thing that I like the most is that, for the most part, I don’t have to think about or see the Freo Z10, whether it’s working or resting. When its resting, it’s quiet and out of the way.. yes it takes up a bit of space in my laundry, but I can close the door, and that’s done. I just have to make sure the door’s open before I leave for work in the morning, and Freo Z10 can get to work. When its working, it’s quiet, deftly avoids most obstacles (though it can get caught up on mobile phone charger cables) and works quickly. It can mop and vacuum my entire apartment in an hour or two, and it’s so quiet that I don’t usually hear it should I happen to be working from home… unless of course it decides to vacuum under my feet. Yes, I don’t let it go into the kids bedroom, because they’re pathologically incapable of picking up socks, cables, toys, and whatnot, and I don’t really want my house clean to be interrupted by the Freo Z10 getting trapped in there before it’s finished everything else. It’s great in the kitchen, too – it vacuums first, then comes back to mop after on its usual program (which you can customise as you see fit), but it’s good for cleaning up ad-hoc messes too. The other day I spilled a coffee in the kitchen, and while I picked up the big bits of the broken cup, there were little shards of ceramic everywhere, as well as most of the contents. Freo Z10 went to work, and while it vacuumed first – and cleaned up all the shards – it did mean it drove through the coffee and I was a little concerned it might wheel coffee tracks over the carpet to get back to its base station. I’m not exactly sure how, but it this didn’t eventuate – the mop pads definitely were a bit brown, but it lifted them out of the way to drive over the carpet, cleaned itself, came back and finished the job. With no intervention whatsoever – besides picking up the larger ceramic pieces that you’d never vacuum anyway – my kitchen was returned to a sparkling clean state within ten minutes. So, too, were Freo Z10’s mop pads – the base station has a deep wash cycle after each mopping exercise, which rinses, washes, and then dries the mop pads. The downside is that it gets through a bit of water to do this, and the grey water tank needs emptying after three or four cycles, but the plus side is a functional mop every time, no stinky wet-mop smell, and a clean house. Can’t complain. Not a great deal. The elephant in the room is the price – Narwal’s Freo Z10 retails for $1,599 at the time of writing, down from its launch price of $1,999. It remains quite expensive, though, and there are definitely more affordable options on the market. However, it is a case of getting what you pay for, and with the Freo Z10, you get all the bells and whistles. It’s a top class vacuum. When I say you get all the bells and whistles, though, there are a couple missing. Yes, Freo Z10 integrates with your choice of voice assistant from Google, Amazon or Apple .. but the integration isn’t amazing. I had a few goes with Alexa and found that it generally didn’t work all that well – after pairing, it seemed reluctant to actually work, though this might’ve been more Alexa’s shortcoming than anything else. It pairs to Google Home, too, but it seems that when its paired with Alexa, you can’t pair it with anything else, which is a bit limiting if you happen to use both. It doesn’t integrate with Home Assistant, and Narwal’s developers have (according to discussion on Reddit) declined to make that possible in future, which smart home aficionados might be a little upset about. As much as I’d love this feature, it’s easy enough to run Freo Z10 on a schedule, and the phone app makes it easy to schedule ad-hoc tasks. The obstacle detection is really good – probably among the best in class – but even still, Freo Z10 manages to get caught up. Twice I’ve found it with a mouthful of my USB-C phone charger, once it ate my daughter’s swimming bag, and it chowed down on a hairbrush (??) one day. However, these were minor things and easily adjusted to avoid future problems, and in the last week, there’s been no jams or anything. Yes.. you do have to clean up a bit for your cleaner, the cliche holds true. Yes. Probably the only reasons you’d think otherwise is the cost, if you don’t have room for what isn’t the smallest base station around, or if you’ve already got a decent robot vacuum. Otherwise, for the lazy homekeeper, the Narwal Freo Z10 is a welcome addition and will reduce your household chores significantly. Yes, it can’t clean your toilets or scrub your shower down, but it can vacuum, mop and sweep, freeing you up for those less pleasant jobs. Narwal’s Freo Z10 retails for $1,599 and you can buy it online from Narwal Australia, Amazon (with delivery in a couple of days), or you can find it in-store at Costco nationwide, Good Guys, and JB HiFi (though not all retailers have actual stock, it might be more a delivery thing). However you get one, we recommend that you do, and you won’t be sorry.
