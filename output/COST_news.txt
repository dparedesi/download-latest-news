by Michael Levanduski TikTok, Shutterstock TikTok, Shutterstock Everyone knows about inflation, and shrinkflation, and a dozen other ways that big companies are trying to boost their profits. This TikToker is shining a light on a whole new method that has been called ‘trickflation,’ and I’m sure you’ve seen it before. He starts his video by saying, “There’s an exciting new way that you’re being ripped off at the grocery store! You’ve, of course, heard of shrinkflation, where manufacturers take an existing product and just shrink it a little bit. Without applying that same shrinkage to the price. You might have even heard of skimpflation, where companies keep the size and the price the same, but just switch out those pesky expensive ingredients for much cheaper ones.” It is a never-ending battle trying to save money. TikTok/earlypete He then introduces the next way they try to get you, “But the new way the grocery industry has tried to screw us is what one Reddit user calls trickflation. You see, they haven’t reduced the amount of soda. Both of these cans are still 12oz. But since the grocery industry thinks the average consumer has the intelligence of a six-year-old child, they’ve put that same 12oz of soda in what looks like a larger can.” Why am I not surprised? Make people think they are getting more when they actually aren’t. TikTok/earlypete He continues, “No, of course, this trickflation only works if they eliminate the previous can, and jack up the price. Which is, of course, exactly what they did.” Great, so it is basically just raising prices with extra steps. TikTok/earlypete He finishes his video by saying, “So, not only do we have to worry about our products shrinking in size, or using ingredients of much lower quality, but we now have to worry about what is almost indisputably deceptive behavior.” They will do anything to keep their profit margins up. Hopefully, people will wise up to this and start shopping with companies that don’t do this type of thing. But I doubt it. Watch the full video below to see what you think. If it didn’t make me so angry, I would honestly be impressed with the creativity the grocery industry comes up with to rip us off #foodfacts#groceryhaul#exposed ♬ In The Hall Of The Mountain King/Grieg – もつ The people in the comments totally support this video. Check them out for yourself. This commenter says those cans actually cost more, too. I mean, this person isn’t wrong. Oh yes, a classic. Just keep paying more, you’ll keep getting less.
