Mike Portal uses a no-fee credit card that gives 6% back on groceries. He pays it off every month. The chicken drumsticks in Chris Lovelace’s freezer cost 99 cents a pound, far cheaper than the red meat he used to buy. Margi Thornburgh, a night owl, checks ads and clips coupons every Wednesday at midnight and hunts for more discounts on store shelves. “I really get a thrill out of getting a bargain,” she said after spotting $1.99 smoothies at Vons recently, down from $3.99. Because they were half off, she bought 12 instead of six. “I was skipping out of the store with a big smile on my face.” These are some of San Diego’s super shoppers, who have been training for this era of fast rising grocery prices for decades. Some have the resources to turn frugal shopping into a sport of sorts — a car that lets them buy in bulk, time to shop for deals, storage space, multiple grocery stores close to home. For others, strapped for space or time, the path to eating adequately while not overspending is more challenging. Grocery prices have risen for a mix of reasons, including pandemic-era supply chain blockages and import tariffs that are passed on to shoppers. In San Diego County, food eaten outside of restaurants cost 4.4% more this July than a year earlier. That is the latest figure from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, whose publications stopped due to the federal shutdown. Fresher data — St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank’s nationwide FRED figures for September — show milk prices were up 10 cents a gallon over last year and up 68 cents over five years earlier, a rise of almost 20%. White bread was down 11 cents from last year but up 38 cents from five years earlier, about 25% higher. Ground beef cost $6.32 a pound, up from $5.67 a year ago and $4.08 in 2020. In the San Diego metro area, meat was 41% higher last month than in October 2019, dairy was 27% higher and produce was 18% higher, according to a grocery price index by Datasembly, a market analytics company that tracks prices of 1,000 products weekly across the United States. Local prices of meat and non-alcoholic beverages kept rising in the past six months, produce is almost even, and dairy and bakery items have fallen slightly, Datasembly found. Faced with these higher prices, San Diegans have changed how they plan and eat. They are abandoning foods and replacing stores they shopped at for decades with ones that have sales and coupons. They’re clinging to a few favorite items — Diet Coke, Diet Snapple, eggs and bourbon were mentioned. But they’re giving up a degree of control, opting to eat what’s on sale and not what they’re craving. They’re doing the math: if I spend this much on gas to drive around or spring for a freezer, but I save that much on food, is it worth it? As a teenager, Thornburgh learned to write grocery lists and shop weekly sales. Some 50 years later, she still uses those methods. But as local food prices have risen, outpacing the national inflation rate, Thornburgh has taken things further, combining every strategy she can think of so she doesn’t spend more than she must. “I look at all the ads either through the emails I receive or directly on the apps. I make my list by store of which items that I want to purchase. … I’m able to shop at multiple stores in one trip. I always bring a cooler to store cold and frozen items,” she outlined in an email to The San Diego Union-Tribune. Strolling through aisles, she keeps looking for deals. “I can be in a store, see an item on the shelf, and I will pull up the Target app, the Walmart app, the Food 4 Less app,” she said. “Any app of the store that I’m not in. And I will look for the price … and I will say, ‘Am I going to buy this here or am I going to go to another store?’” Her weekly grocery loop is time intensive, taking 90 minutes to two hours and covering as much as seven miles. Stops include Walmart, Food 4 less, Trader Joe’s and Vons. She recently folded in Aldi, drawn by an ad for 55-cent avocados. She picked those up, plus raspberries and asparagus, all on sale. Thornburgh, 70, gets income from contract sewing and Social Security. She is not among the 53% of adults who, according to a poll by AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, see grocery expenses as a “major source of stress.” (Groceries beat housing and health care costs and having inadequate savings or income as the top financial worry.) “I feel that I’m skilled enough and take advantage of all the tools out there,” she said. “I don’t feel stressed. But I’m very conscientious.” She reminds her husband: “If it’s not on sale, I’m not buying it. So he was really happy this week when Ding Dongs were on sale.” With these efforts, she spends around $100 a week, up from $60 before the pandemic, and saves around 50% on average at Vons and 40% at Food 4 Less. “With the money I save, it’s worth the investment of time,” she said. Thornburgh offered one more hint: don’t just shop online. Go inside stores. She acknowledged that shopping online and picking up groceries is convenient for some people, including parents of young children, but “you will miss the in-store sales, and sometimes those are substantial.” Jeff Lonsdale, Ken Sobel and Chris Lovelace are cutting back on red meat. “I don’t buy steaks anymore,” said Lonsdale, 68, who lives in a mobile retirement community in Oceanside. A half-package of sirloin burgers from Costco has been sitting in his freezer because he has “better, more affordable choices” today. He used to buy what he wanted, but as his income as a contract circuit designer fell and food prices hit new highs — especially for the beef burgers, steaks and pork chops he once enjoyed — he has changed his habits. “It used to be: I want it, I’ll go get it. Now I think, do I need it? Then maybe I go get it,” he said. “I don’t need doughnuts and cakes and desserts and that kind of thing, so I don’t even bother.” Currently, he said, “my income is short of expenses each month. My savings account keeps me above water.” Worried about cash flow, Lonsdale started tracking all food spending this year — both at stores and the occasional trip to Taco Bell. All together, his monthly spending on food is around $65 this year, he said. A food rescue program he visits three times a week helps him hold down costs, bringing surplus items from local grocery stores to his community. Around 40 people visit each time, he estimated. One recent morning, he picked up seafood salad with crackers, a 12-ounce watermelon cup, two mesquite-seasoned pork chops that totaled 12 ounces, an Earthbound Farms brand veggie tray with ranch dip, baby carrots, broccoli and celery, a Nathan’s hot dog and a 6-ounce Caesar salad. Based on the price tags he saw, he said the total might be around $20. “I mean, would you spend $3.99 for a little tray of cut up watermelon?” he said. “I get it for free and I’m loving it. And it’s not just the volume. It’s the variety. Things I have never thought about trying, never knew they had, wouldn’t have looked for.” Another nice surprise: goat cheese with herbs. “Wow, I’ll try that. It’s free. It was good.” Sobel, 71, who lives in La Jolla, cut out most meat and some other high-cost grocery items. “Sticker shock was a huge part of it — the prices that went higher all the time and the quality going down, almost commensurately,” he said. “That brought my focus back into buying only healthy foods, buying only what I’m going to eat, being careful about our choices.” After a hospitalization, Sobel decided to lose weight. He changed his diet in June and stopped buying “a lot of the high-price, mass-produced snack foods … that have skyrocketed in price.” One more change: “I really don’t throw away food anymore.” He makes a chef salad using turkey breast or sliced ham and eats that several days in a row, “until it’s completely gone.” “I’m lucky enough to be able to cut about 40% from my food budget and afford to eat,” added Sobel, who reduced his household’s average monthly grocery bill from around $550 (not counting the occasional restaurant delivery) before June to around $400 now. “But what about kids and seniors and low-income families who are losing their SNAP benefits?” Almost 400,000 San Diego County residents saw their CalFresh benefits — the state’s version of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) — halted Nov. 1 amid a federal government shutdown, now in its sixth week. Federal judges later ordered that funds be restarted. Between workers whose pay was frozen by the federal shutdown and people whose food benefits were postponed or trimmed, demand is surging at food banks and food-rescue nonprofits, whether in small communities like Lonsdale’s or at large distribution centers. In Encinitas, Lovelace rarely buys red meat at the store anymore. Instead, he goes out for quality burgers. “It’s got really, really good meat,” he said of Versailles Cafe’s $18 cheeseburger and fries. “It’s a real half pound, not a seven ouncer.” Lovelace’s rooftop solar on the house he and his wife, Dana, bought almost 50 years ago powers the two chest freezers he keeps in his garage. “I still don’t have any chicken breast in my freezer that I paid over $2 a pound for,” he said. Bacon was purchased at $4 a pound — around half of what it costs now full price. He is still working through the dozen packages of breakfast sausage he bought at half-off a while back. When he shops, he buys enough meat to last until the next big sale. Lovelace, who is 75 and retired, stopped shopping at stores that don’t send weekly ads. Like Thornburgh, he lives in a grocery-dense neighborhood with “all the big chains, so it’s really easy to get to places.” He focuses on house brands over pricier, name-brand versions. In-season food is also cheaper, he added. And he knows the market. “You have to know your prices. Sometimes that good deal really isn’t,” he said. These efforts are keeping the couple’s grocery costs almost even with last year: $560 a month in 2023 and 2024 and $577 this year, on average. “Doubtless expenses will begin to rise this holiday season as we liquidate our older inventories but we’ll still be kicking butt on money spent for food compared to any of my friends or neighbors when we compare notes on this topic,” Lovelace wrote in an email. He also credited his wife, who embraces his “cheapo philosophy.” In Mt. Helix, Portal is back to shopping like he did when he was a newlywed in the early 1990s — only now he has that cash-back credit card. “I was in the beginning of my career,” he said of his frugal youth. “We chose to have my wife stay home and take care of the babies. So, yeah, we pinched pennies and cut corners to save money.” Now his kids have kids and Portal, 65, has a home on Mt. Helix and a mortgage consulting business. But with the “tremendous increase in food costs” he has observed this year, he buys food on sale and stopped shopping at Whole Foods. “It’s just too high.” His small freezer holds berries bought on sale, which his toddler grandchildren devour. He also buys discounted meat and uses a vacuum sealer to avoid freezer burn. Ribeye on sale rose from $6 a pound to $9 or more, but even that is a relative bargain compared to full price, he said. Uncooked beef steaks cost on average $10.88 a pound last September and $12.26 this September, up from $8.13 five years ago, according to St. Louis Fed FRED data. To keep grocery expenses roughly the same as last year, even while springing for steak — and the chicken he cooks for RiRi, his 13-year-old Labrador pitbull mix — Portal and his wife stock up ahead of big holidays, when sales are “the best.” He gushed about his credit card, an American Express Blue Cash Everyday Card. Never carrying a balance is key, he said. Portal pointed value hunters to GTM Discount General Store, a surplus seller whose weekly sale recently featured 50% off Eddie Bauer sweatshirts, 40% off flood lightbulbs and 40% off spring wreaths. It has great deals on food, Portal added. Lovelace said he’s lucky to have two freezers and the garage shelves he built himself. “We have places to put stuff, and some people don’t. A lot of the things we do don’t apply across the board.” But his approach of stocking up when prices drop has worked across his lifetime. “In any given era, the same rule applies: prices on food have not gone down realistically over any real period of time in my lifetime. Little dips down and big jumps up,” he said.

Title: Tylenol to join Kleenex, Huggies and Listerine in $48.7 billion takeover deal between Kimberly-Clark and Kenvue
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/11/04/tylenol-takeover-kimberly-clark-kenvue-48-7-billion/
Time Published: 2025-11-04T11:47:11Z
Full Content:
Kimberly-Clark is buying Tylenol maker Kenvue in a cash and stock deal worth about $48.7 billion, creating a massive consumer health goods company. Shareholders of Kimberly-Clark will own about 54% of the combined company. Kenvue shareholders will own about 46% in what is one of the largest corporate takeovers this year. The deal must still be approved by the shareholders of both companies. The combined company will have a huge stable of household brands under one roof, putting Kenvue’s Listerine mouthwash and Band-Aid side-by-side with Kimberly-Clark’s Cottonelle toilet paper, Huggies and Kleenex tissues. It will also generate about $32 billion in annual revenue. Kenvue has spent a relatively brief period as an independent company, having been spun off by Johnson & Johnson two years ago. J&J first announced in late 2021 that it was splitting its slow-growth consumer health division from the pharmaceutical and medical device divisions. Kenvue has since been targeted by activist investors unhappy about the trajectory of the company and Wall Street appeared to anticipate some heavy lifting ahead for Kimberly-Clark. Kenvue’s stock jumped 12% Monday afternoon, while shares of Kimberly-Clark, based outside of Dallas, slumped by nearly 15%. Kenvue shares have shed nearly 50% of their value since approaching $28 in the spring of 2023. Morningstar analyst Keonhee Kim said Kenvue’s volatile journey as a public company may have been driven in part by poor execution and a lack of experience operating as a stand-alone business. He said the leadership of a more-established consumer products company like Kimberly-Clark could help unlock some of Kenvue’s value. He also noted that Kenvue brands include Neutrogena, Benadryl and other names that have been in store consumer health aisles for decades. Kim said he thinks Kimberly-Clark may have seen upside in adding those products. “I think that may have made the deal a lot more attractive … especially after the past couple of months of Kenvue’s stock price decline,” he said. Kenvue and Tylenol have been thrust into the national spotlight this year as President Donald Trump and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. promoted unproven and in some cases discredited ties between Tylenol, vaccines and the complex brain disorder autism. Trump then urged pregnant women against using the medicine. That went beyond Food and Drug Administration advice that doctors “should consider minimizing” the painkiller acetaminophen’s use in pregnancy — amid inconclusive evidence about whether too much could be linked to autism. Kennedy reiterated the FDA guidance during a press conference last week. He said that there isn’t sufficient evidence to link the drug to autism. “We have asked physicians to minimize the use to when it’s absolutely necessary,” he said. Kenvue has continued to push back on the Trump administration’s public statements about Tylenol and acetaminophen, the active ingredient it contains. “We strongly disagree with allegations that it does and are deeply concerned about the health risks and confusion this poses for expecting mothers and parents,” Kenvue said in a statement on its website. The merger could face other hurdles. Citi Investment Research analyst Filippo Falorni said he is concerned about the deal’s size given the recent history in the sector, particularly given the challenges faced by Kenvue. In July, Kenvue announced that CEO Thibaut Mongon was leaving in the midst of a strategic review, with the company under mounting pressure from activist investors unhappy about growth. Critics say Kenvue has relied too much on its legacy brands and failed to innovate. Industry analysts also point out the poor track record for mergers involving consumer packaged goods companies. In September, Kraft Heinz said it would break up its decade-old merger. Its net revenue has fallen every year since 2020. Kimberly-Clark and Kenvue, like Kraft Heinz, are facing increasing competition from cheaper store brands. In 2024, 51% of toilet paper and other household paper products sold in the U.S were store brands, according to Circana, a market research company, while store brands held a 24% share of sales of health products, including medications and vitamins. On Monday, a bottle of 100 extra-strength Tylenol caplets cost $10.97 on Walmart’s website. A bottle of 100 extra-strength acetaminophen caplets from Walmart’s Equate brand cost $1.98. Inflation drove some of that buyer behavior, Circana said. Shoppers are also shifting their purchases to stores with more private-label brands, like Aldi and Costco. And stores are improving their offerings and adding more of them; last year, Walmart and Target both launched new store brands to complement their existing ones. Still, both Kimberly-Clark and Kenvue make name-brand products in segments where consumers are less likely to shift to store brands, including hair care, skin care, feminine products and mouth care, according to Circana. Kenvue owns brands like Aveeno and Neutrogena, for example, while Kimberly-Clark makes Kotex and Depend. Kimberly-Clark Chairman and CEO Mike Hsu will be chairman and CEO of the combined company. Three members of the Kenvue’s board will join Kimberly-Clark’s board at closing. The combined company will keep Kimberly-Clark’s headquarters in Irving, Texas, but there will be significant operations around Kenvue facilities and locations as well. The deal is expected to close in the second half of next year. It still needs approval from shareholders of both both companies. Kenvue shareholders will receive $3.50 per share in cash and 0.14625 Kimberly-Clark shares for each Kenvue share held at closing. That amounts to $21.01 per share, based on the closing price of Kimberly-Clark shares on Friday. Kimberly-Clark and Kenvue said that they identified about $1.9 billion in cost savings that are expected in the first three years after the transaction’s closing. ___ AP Health Writer Tom Murphy contributed to this report. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Transcription (Edited): Darren: Hi, I’m Darren Woolley, founder and CEO of TrinityP3 Marketing Management Consultancy, and welcome to Managing Marketing, a weekly podcast discussing the issues and opportunities facing marketing, media, and advertising with industry thought leaders. If you’re enjoying the podcast, please like, review, or share this episode. To be the marketing leader for a major successful consumer packaged goods brand is one thing, but to oversee a portfolio of high-profile, well-loved brands—almost cultural signposts in the market, with decades of prominence—is a major challenge. How do you honor that tradition while nurturing these brands through changes in consumer dietary needs and habits? My guest today has taken on such a challenge at Bega Group. Please welcome the Executive General Manager at Bega Group, Darryn Wallace. Welcome, Darryn. Darryn: Hello, Darren, and thank you for having me. It’s a pleasure to join your podcast today. Career Evolution in Iconic CPG Brands Darren: It’s great catching up. We met when you were at Cadbury, and I’ve followed your career as you’ve built expertise in CPG, beverages, and most recently, dairy. How did you get here? Darryn: I got into consumer goods by chance. I joined Cadbury Schweppes as a graduate in the finance team, which gave me two or three years of grounding in how a business works. I was fortunate to join a company that invested in management experience and learning. I was able to weave my way through many roles, eventually becoming the general manager of marketing at Cadbury, applying the trade to growing great brands. I’ve always had a passion for creating products that the Australian public can love. I’ve zigzagged across categories: confectionery and beverage, and for the last 10 years, dairy, juice, spreads, and staples like Vegemite, Bega Peanut Butter, and Super-Duper ice creams. I’ve been fortunate to work on iconic local brands, but also global brands like Pepsi, Gatorade, and Red Bull. Darren: The portfolio you now manage includes what I call “passion brands.” Vegemite is a cultural signpost. Dairy Farmers, Daily Juice, Pura, and Bega are staples. It must be interesting to apply your global and local experience to these cultural icons. Darryn: If you think about it too long, you can be intimidated. Brands like Farmers Union Greek yogurt (1888), Bega (1899), and Dairy Farmers (1900) are in their third century. You feel a great sense of responsibility and accountability to ensure they remain relevant for today and the next generation. I find it exciting to shape brands with such established heritage and personality to make them modern. The Bega Group is one of the largest agricultural businesses listed on the ASX. We are Australian-owned and local. The ability to be empowered and manage these brands using our local team, local insights, science, and technology is incredibly rewarding. Local Ownership and Relationships in the Dairy Sector Darren: The heavy emphasis on dairy is interesting. Dairy was traditionally connected to the farm, often through co-ops, before corporatization. The industry seems to benefit significantly from local ownership. Darryn: It does. My first impression was that it’s a business of relationships. We run personalized relationships with over 800 farmers across the country who are critical to our success. The market was regulated for a long time, so brands like Big M in Victoria and Masters Milk in West Australia have deep history in their local communities, creating high levels of trust and loyalty. Dairy is an “always on” business. With short shelf-life products, you’re fighting for distribution every day. Our ability to service the market relies on deep relationships because we’re running seven days a week, 52 weeks a year. CPG/FMCG as the Ideal Marketing Training Ground Darren: Many marketers say starting a career in CPG/FMCG is one of the best ways to get hands-on training in the full skillset of marketing. Teams work across product, packaging, pricing, and distribution. Do you feel this comprehensive training is important? Darryn: One hundred percent. I was fortunate to join Cadbury Schweppes when it was integrating businesses, giving it a broad portfolio. As a local business, we had the autonomy to influence what products we made, how we marketed them, where we sold them, and how we priced and promoted them. Cadbury also invested heavily in people, providing training in core marketing disciplines and executive skills like managing change and acquisitions. This comprehensive training has changed over the last 10 years due to globalization. But one of the joys of working with the Bega Group is that we are a local business, which retains the ability to steward brands through a great local team with autonomy over brands and customer relationships. Darren: In global organizations, there’s often more siloing. A strength of CPG/FMCG is a clear understanding of the role of sales to customers (securing pricing and distribution) and marketing to consumers (driving demand) working hand-in-hand—the basis of the Four Ps. Darryn: I have a philosophy I call “removing alibis”—getting rid of excuses so the team can do their best work. Accountability is high. You have to develop the right product with the right insights, explain it to the customer so they stock it, have it come off the shelf, and ensure the consumer likes it enough to buy it again. You learn through doing, and you have no one else to blame. The ability for all technical and specialist functions to work in concert makes the difference. Darren: I find the talk that the generalist is no longer needed overlooks dealing with complexity. While you have specialists (the vertical of the ‘T’ capability), you still need someone with an overview to bring it all together (the horizontal of the ‘T’). Darryn: I grew up in a world that prioritized getting the product right and ensuring availability before promotion or advertising. That generalized capability is really important—knowing which dots to join up. I’m highly dependent on the team and the new skills they bring. I didn’t grow up in the e-commerce era, where for some categories, a third of sales are consumed online. The ability to blend that breadth of knowledge and experience with the art needed in each discipline is key. Product Trends and E-commerce in a Portfolio Strategy Darren: Thirty percent of sales through e-commerce is significant. While people focus on performance media in e-commerce, brand has never been more important. Also, customer experience of the brand has become more important than just the messaging. Darryn: We all shop with our eyes. In a digital environment, products need to “pop off the page and say, ‘Purchase me.'” For food or beverage, it’s the appetite appeal of the images, the relevant words, and being in the right place on the digital shelf. All these disciplines are still focused on making sure we stand out in the most compelling way. We have a large portfolio—more than 30 brands. To manage this, we prioritize eight “power brands” that are market leaders, bring a clear point of difference, and represent over three quarters of our profit. We look after the base and prioritize those eight to make them relevant and future-proof. Darren: Let’s focus on dairy trends. Dairy is ancient, yet we see trends like high fat, low fat, and now high protein. How do you determine whether a trend is a short-term fad or worth tapping into? Darryn: Protein is nearly a mega-trend right now, driven partly by a consequence of COVID. People of all ages are proactively attuned to their health and well-being, consciously focusing on macronutrients. Darren: The focus on longevity and the switch against sugar and carbohydrates have replaced the old low-fat focus, which often relied on corn syrup or high sugar to replace texture. This is now replaced by the need for high protein. Darryn: Flavored milk has taken the next leap. Dairy is a great source of protein, so we can now offer a drink with 30 grams of protein, no added sugar, and reduced fat milk. It brings all the macronutrients of dairy—hydration, calcium, B vitamins, and protein—at a low calorific value. This has become a convenient, enjoyable, and affordable meal replacement. We are seeing the advancement of functionality in dairy. pouch yogurt continues to grow because of its convenience and ease of consumption, with many offering 15 grams of protein. Distribution, Pricing, and the “Always On” Operation Darren: Let’s talk about distribution. I initially thought of your brands as supermarket grocery, but dairy drinks are in every convenience store and servo, plus 30% online. Darryn: I’ve really enjoyed the breadth of customer or channel in dairy. For yogurt, we sell through traditional supermarkets, bulk discounters (Costco, Aldi), online, petrol stations (7-Eleven), health and aged care, and QSR (McDonald’s Happy Meals). Back-of-house yogurt and cream go into most restaurants and cafes. We serve a diverse customer base, so understanding the right offers, pack sizes, and pricing equations for each is vital. Packaging serves multiple roles: providing the correct serve size and representing the brand as a trust mark. Darren: On pricing, the cost-of-living crisis has seen prices on essentials increase significantly, driven by whole supply chain issues, especially energy. Darryn: Inflation has been a real challenge for the Australian public, and dairy has been at the heart of it. We’ve had environmental issues impacting the cost to produce milk, as well as rising costs for transport, ingredients, and packaging. Dairy is a low-margin category, so our focus is productivity first, then pricing to offset costs after all productivity measures. We are deliberate about what price to take, on which products, and how it aligns with household affordability. The last few years have been challenging because you don’t want to take a price that causes consumers to reappraise your brand. Darren: With the short shelf-life of fresh white milk (18 to 20 days is the shortest), there’s little time to move the product from farm to consumption. You’re constantly trying to build a business model that’s efficient and without disruption. This makes it a seven-day-a-week operation—you constantly have to move. Brand Promotion and Distinctive Advertising Darren: For the agencies listening, let’s get onto promotion. You have brands with decades of positioning. What’s your philosophy or approach to advertising for building these brands? Darryn: It’s changed slightly in the last 10 years. We probably don’t invest enough, but where we do, we aim to be noticed and distinctive, leveraging existing assets and fame. For Dairy Farmers, the traditional ad would have shown the farmer, cows, and rolling paddocks, focusing on purity. Our most recent ad shows a cow surfing on a surfboard with people eating different Dairy Farmers products. We are trying to bring more personality and emotion to the advertising and move away from stereotypes. We wanted to capture the emotion of feeling alive and ready to conquer the day. Our advertising is about being brave to do something different. The message, “start the day with oomph,” brings distinctiveness and works well across all aspects of the brand. To me, staying modern, bringing personality to life, and capturing the emotion is the key to building loyalty. Darren: Absolutely.

Darren: Hi, I’m Darren Woolley, founder and CEO of TrinityP3 Marketing Management Consultancy, and welcome to Managing Marketing, a weekly podcast discussing the issues and opportunities facing marketing, media, and advertising with industry thought leaders. If you’re enjoying the podcast, please like, review, or share this episode. To be the marketing leader for a major successful consumer packaged goods brand is one thing, but to oversee a portfolio of high-profile, well-loved brands—almost cultural signposts in the market, with decades of prominence—is a major challenge. How do you honor that tradition while nurturing these brands through changes in consumer dietary needs and habits? My guest today has taken on such a challenge at Bega Group. Please welcome the Executive General Manager at Bega Group, Darryn Wallace. Welcome, Darryn. Darryn: Hello, Darren, and thank you for having me. It’s a pleasure to join your podcast today. Darren: It’s great catching up. We met when you were at Cadbury, and I’ve followed your career as you’ve built expertise in CPG, beverages, and most recently, dairy. How did you get here? Darryn: I got into consumer goods by chance. I joined Cadbury Schweppes as a graduate in the finance team, which gave me two or three years of grounding in how a business works. I was fortunate to join a company that invested in management experience and learning. I was able to weave my way through many roles, eventually becoming the general manager of marketing at Cadbury, applying the trade to growing great brands. I’ve always had a passion for creating products that the Australian public can love. I’ve zigzagged across categories: confectionery and beverage, and for the last 10 years, dairy, juice, spreads, and staples like Vegemite, Bega Peanut Butter, and Super-Duper ice creams. I’ve been fortunate to work on iconic local brands, but also global brands like Pepsi, Gatorade, and Red Bull. Darren: The portfolio you now manage includes what I call “passion brands.” Vegemite is a cultural signpost. Dairy Farmers, Daily Juice, Pura, and Bega are staples. It must be interesting to apply your global and local experience to these cultural icons. Darryn: If you think about it too long, you can be intimidated. Brands like Farmers Union Greek yogurt (1888), Bega (1899), and Dairy Farmers (1900) are in their third century. You feel a great sense of responsibility and accountability to ensure they remain relevant for today and the next generation. I find it exciting to shape brands with such established heritage and personality to make them modern. The Bega Group is one of the largest agricultural businesses listed on the ASX. We are Australian-owned and local. The ability to be empowered and manage these brands using our local team, local insights, science, and technology is incredibly rewarding. Darren: The heavy emphasis on dairy is interesting. Dairy was traditionally connected to the farm, often through co-ops, before corporatization. The industry seems to benefit significantly from local ownership. Darryn: It does. My first impression was that it’s a business of relationships. We run personalized relationships with over 800 farmers across the country who are critical to our success. The market was regulated for a long time, so brands like Big M in Victoria and Masters Milk in West Australia have deep history in their local communities, creating high levels of trust and loyalty. Dairy is an “always on” business. With short shelf-life products, you’re fighting for distribution every day. Our ability to service the market relies on deep relationships because we’re running seven days a week, 52 weeks a year. Darren: Many marketers say starting a career in CPG/FMCG is one of the best ways to get hands-on training in the full skillset of marketing. Teams work across product, packaging, pricing, and distribution. Do you feel this comprehensive training is important? Darryn: One hundred percent. I was fortunate to join Cadbury Schweppes when it was integrating businesses, giving it a broad portfolio. As a local business, we had the autonomy to influence what products we made, how we marketed them, where we sold them, and how we priced and promoted them. Cadbury also invested heavily in people, providing training in core marketing disciplines and executive skills like managing change and acquisitions. This comprehensive training has changed over the last 10 years due to globalization. But one of the joys of working with the Bega Group is that we are a local business, which retains the ability to steward brands through a great local team with autonomy over brands and customer relationships. Darren: In global organizations, there’s often more siloing. A strength of CPG/FMCG is a clear understanding of the role of sales to customers (securing pricing and distribution) and marketing to consumers (driving demand) working hand-in-hand—the basis of the Four Ps. Darryn: I have a philosophy I call “removing alibis”—getting rid of excuses so the team can do their best work. Accountability is high. You have to develop the right product with the right insights, explain it to the customer so they stock it, have it come off the shelf, and ensure the consumer likes it enough to buy it again. You learn through doing, and you have no one else to blame. The ability for all technical and specialist functions to work in concert makes the difference. Darren: I find the talk that the generalist is no longer needed overlooks dealing with complexity. While you have specialists (the vertical of the ‘T’ capability), you still need someone with an overview to bring it all together (the horizontal of the ‘T’). Darryn: I grew up in a world that prioritized getting the product right and ensuring availability before promotion or advertising. That generalized capability is really important—knowing which dots to join up. I’m highly dependent on the team and the new skills they bring. I didn’t grow up in the e-commerce era, where for some categories, a third of sales are consumed online. The ability to blend that breadth of knowledge and experience with the art needed in each discipline is key. Darren: Thirty percent of sales through e-commerce is significant. While people focus on performance media in e-commerce, brand has never been more important. Also, customer experience of the brand has become more important than just the messaging. Darryn: We all shop with our eyes. In a digital environment, products need to “pop off the page and say, ‘Purchase me.'” For food or beverage, it’s the appetite appeal of the images, the relevant words, and being in the right place on the digital shelf. All these disciplines are still focused on making sure we stand out in the most compelling way. We have a large portfolio—more than 30 brands. To manage this, we prioritize eight “power brands” that are market leaders, bring a clear point of difference, and represent over three quarters of our profit. We look after the base and prioritize those eight to make them relevant and future-proof. Darren: Let’s focus on dairy trends. Dairy is ancient, yet we see trends like high fat, low fat, and now high protein. How do you determine whether a trend is a short-term fad or worth tapping into? Darryn: Protein is nearly a mega-trend right now, driven partly by a consequence of COVID. People of all ages are proactively attuned to their health and well-being, consciously focusing on macronutrients. Darren: The focus on longevity and the switch against sugar and carbohydrates have replaced the old low-fat focus, which often relied on corn syrup or high sugar to replace texture. This is now replaced by the need for high protein. Darryn: Flavored milk has taken the next leap. Dairy is a great source of protein, so we can now offer a drink with 30 grams of protein, no added sugar, and reduced fat milk. It brings all the macronutrients of dairy—hydration, calcium, B vitamins, and protein—at a low calorific value. This has become a convenient, enjoyable, and affordable meal replacement. We are seeing the advancement of functionality in dairy. pouch yogurt continues to grow because of its convenience and ease of consumption, with many offering 15 grams of protein. Darren: Let’s talk about distribution. I initially thought of your brands as supermarket grocery, but dairy drinks are in every convenience store and servo, plus 30% online. Darryn: I’ve really enjoyed the breadth of customer or channel in dairy. For yogurt, we sell through traditional supermarkets, bulk discounters (Costco, Aldi), online, petrol stations (7-Eleven), health and aged care, and QSR (McDonald’s Happy Meals). Back-of-house yogurt and cream go into most restaurants and cafes. We serve a diverse customer base, so understanding the right offers, pack sizes, and pricing equations for each is vital. Packaging serves multiple roles: providing the correct serve size and representing the brand as a trust mark. Darren: On pricing, the cost-of-living crisis has seen prices on essentials increase significantly, driven by whole supply chain issues, especially energy. Darryn: Inflation has been a real challenge for the Australian public, and dairy has been at the heart of it. We’ve had environmental issues impacting the cost to produce milk, as well as rising costs for transport, ingredients, and packaging. Dairy is a low-margin category, so our focus is productivity first, then pricing to offset costs after all productivity measures. We are deliberate about what price to take, on which products, and how it aligns with household affordability. The last few years have been challenging because you don’t want to take a price that causes consumers to reappraise your brand. Darren: With the short shelf-life of fresh white milk (18 to 20 days is the shortest), there’s little time to move the product from farm to consumption. You’re constantly trying to build a business model that’s efficient and without disruption. This makes it a seven-day-a-week operation—you constantly have to move. Darren: For the agencies listening, let’s get onto promotion. You have brands with decades of positioning. What’s your philosophy or approach to advertising for building these brands? Darryn: It’s changed slightly in the last 10 years. We probably don’t invest enough, but where we do, we aim to be noticed and distinctive, leveraging existing assets and fame. For Dairy Farmers, the traditional ad would have shown the farmer, cows, and rolling paddocks, focusing on purity. Our most recent ad shows a cow surfing on a surfboard with people eating different Dairy Farmers products. We are trying to bring more personality and emotion to the advertising and move away from stereotypes. We wanted to capture the emotion of feeling alive and ready to conquer the day. Our advertising is about being brave to do something different. The message, “start the day with oomph,” brings distinctiveness and works well across all aspects of the brand. To me, staying modern, bringing personality to life, and capturing the emotion is the key to building loyalty. Darren: Absolutely. The heritage was good for its time, but being much more consumer-focused—answering the question “what’s in it for me?”—is really important, and your approach does that.
