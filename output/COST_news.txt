Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily U.S. retailers are looking for consumers to stay resilient and expect low-single-digit sales gains and minimal impact on prices from tariffs this holiday season. Senior Editor, Retail Retailers are feeling pretty good about the holiday 2025 season, even though shoppers are likely to shorten their gift lists as they fret over tariffs, the economy and geopolitical turmoil. Retailers, partially lifted by inflation, expect on average low-single-digit sales gains for the holiday season, slightly under last year’s 4.2 percent sales growth. Here’s why: Number one, Americans’ spending behaviors belie how they feel about the world and their personal finances. Consumers continue to show shopping resilience while purchasing selectively and cautiously for deals. The back-to-school season has been good and widely seen as a barometer for the holiday period. Tariffs shouldn’t jack up merchandise prices too much, at least not for the rest of this year, as major retailers absorb much of the higher costs of importing.

Furthermore, the stock market is holding up, interest rates are seen coming down, and the end of the de minimis exemption for goods valued under $800 — which allowed retailers, including Chinese mass merchants, to sell their wares directly to U.S. consumers without incurring extra costs — should make U.S. retailers more competitive. You May Also Like More significantly, retailers have been extending their holiday marketing, many launching campaigns around Halloween, some even promoting “Christmas in July,” after importing holiday goods earlier this year. Macy’s ran a “Black Friday in July” sales event for five days starting July 23. It also marketed a “Christmas in July” sale on July 25 for the first time, offering holiday and general merchandise, according to a news release. For some consumers, “Christmas in July” is not just about saving money, it’s also about saving time and avoiding the holiday rush for popular items. Like last year, there are 27 days between Thanksgiving and Christmas in 2025. Sources told WWD they expect mass merchants, discounters, off-pricers, warehouse clubs, electronics stores and selected apparel specialty retailers to do well during holiday 2025. Walmart has an upbeat outlook on the season, based on steady back-to-school shopping. The company raised its forecast for sales gains this year to 3.75 percent to 4.75 percent, up from the previous forecast of gains ranging from 3 percent to 4 percent. “Back-to-school is usually something of an indicator of how the holidays will go, and we feel good about how it went for us in terms of units and dollars sold and inventory sell through at both Walmart and Sam’s Club,” Doug McMillon, president and chief executive officer, said during a second-quarter conference call with investors and industry analysts. “Our top back-to-school items had a lower price than last year, and we offered a basket of everything students need for their first day of school for under $65. “We had our Walmart U.S. store managers together last week for our holiday planning meeting, where they got to see many of our new items, and pricing for the upcoming season. We liked what we saw and heard, and we like our position for the back half of the year. We’re expecting to have a good holiday season at Walmart,” he added. “It should be a good, solid holiday season,” said Stephen D. Lebovitz, president and CEO of CBL Properties. His outlook, he said, is “definitely more positive now than if you would have asked me the same question in April or May.” He said U.S. President Donald Trump’s recent pause on China tariffs for 90 days, and locking in some trade deals in Europe “gives the retailers more clarity on what they are paying for goods, more confidence in ordering inventory and being stocked correctly for the holidays. Also, the economy has continued to perform well. The stock market is up. Consumer confidence has hit some low points, but the degree to which we see consumers shopping would suggest otherwise.” Asked when he thinks retailers will kick off their holiday campaigning, Lebovitz said, “I don’t think it can start any earlier than it has in recent past seasons. Once we finish Halloween, holiday starts ramping up. It’s hard to imagine it accelerating anymore.” The National Retail Federation predicts holiday sales gains of between 2.5 percent and 3.5 percent over the 2024 holiday season; Deloitte forecasts 3.1 percent growth. Somewhat less optimistic is Marshall Cohen, chief retail adviser at Circana, who sees retailers posting flat to 2.5 percent growth for holiday 2025. He said that’s based on current trends; consumer behavior from last year; how the calendar falls; the propensity for travel and other expenses cutting into retail spending, and some elevated prices. “Retailers will absolutely push for an early start [to the holiday season] and consumers will respond because they are thinking about price increases and supplies running out. You will see an early start form a promotional standpoint. Then there will be a post-Black Friday lull and a surge in shopping in the last week, but that lull after Black Friday is getting deeper,” he said. Asked if the back-to-school season is a barometer for how the holiday season plays out, Cohen said, “It is sometimes an indication of good things, it tells you the willingness of the consumer to engage, look for a deal, buy higher price or new product, and where and how the consumer is shopping. Back-to-school is definitely a strong indicator of things to come but not necessarily foolproof.” “We have always felt that the back-to-school season is a good but imperfect predictor of subsequent holiday sales,” said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners, the consulting and research firm. He said he’s “cautiously optimistic” about the holiday season, partly because shoppers have shown resourcefulness and resilience ever since the COVID-19 bounceback by retailers in late 2020. “There are four key macro ingredients to a successful holiday landscape,” Johnson explained. “There has to be solid disposable personal income growth, which year-to-date is up 4.5 percent which is solid and consistent with overall holiday sales of between 4 and 6 percent, in nominal numbers.” Factoring in inflation, 4.5 percent comes out to 1.6 percent to 1.7 percent real sales growth, he added. “The second macro factor is that consumers have money in hand to spend — the dry powder. We believe the personal savings rate is a nice solid 4.7 percent and that compares to last year’s 3.8 percent. “The third factor is you have to have newness, in both format and fashion. We are seeing a lot of new openings by stronger players,” Johnson said, also pointing to the teen market with such players as Abercrombie & Fitch partnering with the NFL. “Retailers doing joint marketing do bring some newess,” he said. “The fourth macro factor is there has to be a catalyst that can trigger growth. We think the rebound in the housing market, which just bottomed out, will gain momentum while interest rates slide down further. Once the interest rate hits 5 percent, housing will take off,” spurring sales of home improvement merchandise, consumer electronics and major appliances, he said. On the fashion side, Johnson expects athleisure and footwear to shine this holiday season, including such brands as Free People, Alo and Vuori, which deliver newness. “Strong and consistent transaction growth, not footfall necessarily, is the hallmark of all superior retailers. Look for them to be the winners this holiday season. So it’s Home Depot, Lowe’s, Costco, TJX Cos., Walmart. They all know how to drive growth, and the bigger you are, the more likely you are able to motor through whatever tariff tides come your way. They will work out deals to protect their customers. A lot of them will take cost pressures off the consumer and move it up the value chain,” Johnson said.

Title: Celebrate Labor Day with these awesome (electric) work truck deals

It’s Labor Day weekend, which means big deals on car lots across America – especially if you’re shopping for a new electric vehicle to help with your labor. We’ve rounded up the best offers on electric pickups, vans, and even a great option for ride share drivers! Sure, there’s a bit of irony in pitching “work vehicles” on a holiday meant for not working – but for many small business owners, work is part of who they are. And with the $7,500 federal EV tax credit set to expire, plus a wave of great Labor Day deals on work-ready EVs, now might be the best time yet to plug into a new electric ride. Here are some of the standout electric vehicles offers we found this Labor Day weekend (2025), organized by vehicle type. The “Ford for America,” summer sales event continues through Labor Day with interest-free 0% financing, $0 down payment, and zero payments for up to 90 days for retail customers. Ford is also throwing in $0 maintenance for 24 months. But wait, there’s more! Ford Authority is reporting that a complimentary home charger and standard installation might also be included as part of the Ford Power Promise promotion happening at participating dealers in select markets with the purchase of a new F-150 Lightning pickup through the end of September. Lease customers aren’t being left out, either. You can lease a 2025 Ford F-150 Lightning XLT 4P 311A pickup at $399 per month for 36 months, with “just” $399 due at signing (basically your first month’s payment). The best electric vehicle deal in the business keeps on truckin’ into Labor Day weekend, with new 2025 Brightdrop models currently eligible for up to $21,500 in manufacturer rebates before any Federal, state, local utility, or even Costco membership incentives kick in. For your money, you get a capable, Ultium-based electric cargo van with more room than your college dorm and a nationwide dealer network to keep it up and running when you need it most. Despite being based on the company’s existing diesel platform, Mercedes’ eSprinter has proven itself a capable urban hauler in the hands of Amazon, DHL, and countless European tradespeople. Despite that, there are still a handful of leftover 2024 models hanging around dealer lots – enough that Mercedes is offering up to $30,000 (!) Customer Cash on any new ’24MY eSprinter purchased from dealer stock. That discount is enough to bring the price of this 2024 eSprinter in Chicago from $87,823 all the way down to $57,823 this Labor Day weekend – and that’s before you factor in state and local utility incentives that can bring the price down even further. As you can imagine, there’s some fine print on that Customer Cash deal. It can’t be combined with Special APR programs through Mercedes-Benz Financial Services (MBFS), but it can be combined with the Mercedes-Benz Commercial Vehicles Medium Fleet Program. Ride share drivers looking for comfortable seats, room for five adults and their luggage, proven battery life, and lickety-quick charging speeds can stop looking. Volkswagen is offering a sweet ID.4 lease at nearly half the cost of an entry-level Jetta with payments starting at just $129/mo. – that’s despite the ID.4 carrying a significantly higher MSRP. And, while we’re at it, it’s probably worth noting that serious road warriors will probably save more than $129/mo. in fuel alone. If you prefer to own your vehicles after making payments on them for a few years, you can also get 0% interest financing on select ID.4s for up to 72 months. It’s important to note here that Volkswagen’s deals can vary wildly by region. That $129/mo. offer is available in California and a few other West Coast states, for example, but the electric crossover’s listed at $329 for 24 months with $4,499 due at signing in others. Disclaimer: the vehicle models and financing deals above were sourced from CarsDirect, CarEdge, and (where mentioned) the OEM websites – and were current as of 29AUG2025. These deals may not be available in every market, with every discount, or for every buyer (the standard “with approved credit” fine print should be considered implied).
