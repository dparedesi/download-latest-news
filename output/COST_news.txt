We believe everyone should be able to make financial decisions with confidence. And while our site doesn’t feature every company or financial product available on the market, we’re proud that the guidance we offer, the information we provide and the tools we create are objective, independent, straightforward — and free. So how do we make money? Our partners compensate us. This may influence which products we review and write about (and where those products appear on the site), but it in no way affects our recommendations or advice, which are grounded in thousands of hours of research. Our partners cannot pay us to guarantee favorable reviews of their products or services. Here is a list of our partners. Many, or all, of the products featured on this page are from our advertising partners who compensate us when you take certain actions on our website or click to take an action on their website. However, this does not influence our evaluations. Our opinions are our own. Here is a list of our partners and here's how we make money. November is a great month for bargains. Black Friday happens this month after all, and the supposed single-day sale holiday seems to get stronger and go longer every year. Plus, online retailers like to keep you guessing and may drop a worthy deal on any given day. Your strategy to save money this month? Review your budget, make a list of what you want and remember to ABC: always be checkin’ (or just set deal alerts) for discounts. Consult this Nerdy list of the best things to buy and skip in November, too. Black Friday, which falls on Nov. 29 this year, is synonymous with great deals on gadgets, but you may not have to wait until the end of the month to get the goods you’re after. Jane Boyd Thomas, a professor of marketing at Winthrop University, says she’s noticed retailers are getting an early jump on technology deals. “We know that a lot of spending on Black Friday is self-giving, not gift-giving,” says Thomas. And with consumers still dealing with high prices in non-discretionary categories like food and fuel, retailers can entice shoppers to spend discretionary dollars with deals that come early and often. Look for markdowns on TVs, tablets, laptops, gaming systems, smartwatches and smartphones at all the usual places — Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy, Target and Costco — between now and Black Friday. Need a thicker comforter for the cold months? January is just around the corner, and it’s your best bet for a deal on bedding and linens. Stores promote bedding discounts, called white sales, at the beginning of each year as a way to bring shoppers into their home departments. In past years, bedding basics were slashed by 50% or more at stores like JCPenney, Macy’s and Pottery Barn. We expect similar savings again in 2025. Aside from spring cleaning season, November might be the best time to add a new vacuum cleaner to your closet. We usually see vacuum models from Dyson, Shark, Bissell, Hoover and more on sale during Black Friday events. At NerdWallet, we tracked prices on a handful of products during major sale days. The iRobot Roomba i5 vacuum had a lower price on Black Friday 2023 than on Amazon’s Prime Day in July of this year. Expect sweeping sales on high-tech sweepers to land at the end of the month. This is unconventional, but to save money you may want to wait on apparel — especially items like shoes, hats, coats and gloves — says Thomas. “As we get closer to Christmas, I think the deals on those are going to be better and better,” she says. November, especially Black Friday, isn’t a bad time to buy clothes, but larger retailers that hold a lot of stock could be eager to offload unsold items as the gift-giving season gets closer. Stores like Gap, Anthropologie and Ann Taylor are likely to have more inventory than one-off boutique clothing stores, “so you have a better chance of getting what you want by playing the ‘wait game’ there,” says Thomas. Air fryers burst onto the scene around 2017, and the versatile cookers are still hot. Black Friday is a good time to go after these hot products, or you could score a deal on any given day in November. I found an Instant Vortex Plus air fryer for half off list price on Nov. 5 last year. The shiny stainless steel model caught my eye while at a friend’s house for dinner one evening. I checked Amazon when I got home and couldn’t pass up the $69.95 price. At the time of this writing, it retails for $139.95. I got a Black Friday price on a random Sunday in November. What else is hot in November? Coffee makers. Look for great deals on Nespresso, Keurig and other popular coffee maker brands in November, especially on Black Friday. On the other hand, you may want to roll the dice and wait for Cyber Monday — which falls on Dec. 2 this year — for other kitchen gadgets. We’ve seen items like the KitchenAid Classic Series stand mixer reach a lower price on Cyber Monday than on Black Friday at Amazon and Target. You know that meat and cheese board or tin filled with peppermint bark you send to family when you run out of time and gift ideas? According to Thomas’ advice, you can keep specialty treats as your backup plan. Retailers may not be motivated to move items quickly because seasonal treats tend to have a long shelf life and people often send them as last-minute gifts, she says. Veterans Day doesn’t pack the shopping punch of Black Friday. Still, here are some bonus ways to save a buck on Nov. 11. If you serve or have served in the military, ask about special discounts at stores, restaurants and even barbershops. For example, Rack Room Shoes will offer a 20% discount (normally 10%) to current and former U.S. military members and their dependents. Sport Clips is doing free haircuts for vets and active duty military at participating locations on Veterans Day. Whether you've served in the military or not, you can visit one of the U.S. National Parks that typically charges an entrance fee for free on Veterans Day. Mobile shopping and dynamic pricing (e.g., the random air fryer deal I found on Nov. 5) make it all too easy to spend on a whim. Go into November knowing what you want to buy and how much you’re willing to spend on a given item. If you know what you want, you can monitor and compare prices throughout the month, says Thomas. You can use a site like Slickdeals.net to set deal alerts for price drops all over the internet or use a price tracker like CamelCamelCamel for alerts on products sold on Amazon. And if you buy something in November, but before Black Friday, you’ll want to check the retailer’s price-matching, price-protection and return policies first. For example, Amazon’s site specifically states that because the retailer strives to maintain competitive prices, it does not offer price matching. Be sure to dig into the details, too. Best Buy’s price match guarantee, for example, excludes items for sale Nov. 21 through Dec. 2 this year. Thomas’ advice: Let the store’s policy help you decide whether to take the deal now or risk it and wait for a better one on Black Friday. On a similar note...

Title: I've worked at Costco for over 19 years. Here are my 7 best tips for shopping there.

I've worked at Costco's membership counter for over 19 years. Throughout my time at the warehouse, I've picked up a few tips to help save money and grab my favorite items before they're gone. Here are eight tips I use almost every day so I don't miss out on groceries and items at Costco. I think Costco's executive option is the best way to get your money's worth and make the most out of your membership. Although it's twice the cost of a gold-star membership at $130, the executive membership gives customers 2% back on most purchases, including at the pharmacy and tire shop, and on optical and hearing-aid services. Cardholders usually get their 2% reward in the mail two months prior to renewal time and may use it for future purchases or their next membership fee. Executive members can also receive up to $1,250 on qualified Costco purchases annually. Just keep in mind that certain products — including tobacco, gasoline, Costco cash cards, and postage stamps — are excluded from the 2% cash-back reward. If you buy something at full value and it decreases in price, you might be able to take advantage of Costco's price and coupon adjustments 30 days from the date of purchase. Bring in your original receipt and head to the refund counter to try for your adjustment. If you can't find your receipt, just simply ask a team member at the counter to help you out. If you purchase something online and notice a difference in the price, go to Costco.com under "rebates" and do a price adjustment yourself. Signs with the asterisk at the upper-right corner mean it's time to stock up because Costco will not be restocking that item. If you enjoy a product, make sure to check its sign occasionally. Employees at Costco's membership counter can also check if any surrounding warehouses will continue to restock that item. Prices ending in .97 or .00 are on sale. Most markdown prices mean the warehouse is trying to get rid of it, or it's a seasonal item. That being said, prices may vary per location. Kirkland Signature is Costco's own brand and has products that are comparable to more mainstream brands. To me, it's worth trying Kirkland Signature items because Costco offers a satisfaction-guarantee policy. If you're unhappy, you can usually return the item for a full refund. Downloading the Costco app before your shopping trip can be very useful because you can see what's on sale as you shop or even before your trip. You can also access your membership card (which may even eliminate the need to bring your physical card) receipts, online orders, any 2% reward balance, and your Costco Anywhere visa card — if you have one — through the app. Costco doesn't provide grocery bags, but there are boxes available to help pack your items, usually toward the exit of the store. I also recommend bringing some reusable bags to make packing up your shopping go smoother. This story was originally published on May 2, 2023, and most recently updated on November 1, 2024. Jump to

Heavenly Homemakers Encouraging women in homemaking, healthy eating and parenting November 1, 2024 by Laura 3 Comments Here’s our Big Family Grocery Spending for October, 2024 post! Here’s how we spent our grocery budget for our large household during the month of October. We fed 14 people three meals each day, plus a lot of wonderful guests… 1. Sam’s On October 3, we had a huge grocery stock-up trip at Sam’s. We got potatoes, grapes, strawberries, nectarines, spinach, tomato soup, hamburger meat, chicken thighs, meat sticks, snacks, peanut butter, honey, milk, cream, eggs, shredded cheese, pistachios, olive oil, coconut oil, brown sugar, condiments, chicken broth, yogurt and applesauce pouches, tomato sauce, spaghetti sauce, maple syrup, coffee, bacon, white queso, and avocado cups. Total for groceries at Sam’s: $582.44 2. Hy-Vee Pick-Up That same day, I had put a pick-up order in at Hy-Vee for some of our WIC items for our girls for the month. Malorie picked it up for me, which was a huge help. Total out of pocket at Hy-Vee: $0 3. Aldi On October 10, Malorie and I took the four littlest to Aldi. I mostly needed milk and salsa, but since it’s tough to get to the store and we were already there, I stocked up on many of our favorite Aldi items: Milk, Yogurt, Granola, Fruit/Veggie Pouches, a case of Salsa, Sausage, Grass Fed Beef (on sale!), Coffee Creamer, Organic Pears, Bananas, Blackberries, Sliced Ham, Frozen Fries, Canned Fruit in 100% juice, and Clementines. Total for groceries at Aldi: $207.71 4. Costco On October 16, Auggie and I went to Costco to stock up on fresh fruit and veggies plus other Costco favorites/needs. We got 6 pounds of strawberries, 2 containers of raspberries, bananas, spring mix, spinach, grapes, 6 pounds of apples, a large bag of oranges, applesauce cups, mandarin orange cups, peach cups, frozen fruit for smoothies, cocoa powder, chicken nuggets, fries, applesauce pouches, yogurt pouches, heavy whipping cream, half and half, sliced cheese, cream cheese, frozen meatballs, avocado cups, canned pumpkin, frozen pizza, turkey lunch meat, and butter. Total for groceries at Costco: $360.31 5. Walmart I needed Walmart that day too but didn’t have time, so I put in a pick-up order for Matt to grab while he was out that afternoon. My order that day was mostly non-grocery, but we also got milk, pickle relish, wheat germ, cheese, carrots, and Caesar salad. I forgot to take a picture. :/ Total for food at Walmart: $29.68 6. Amazon We have a standing order of subscribe and save items from Amazon, which is mostly applesauce and yogurt pouches. I also get these pizza crusts for cheap, x2. Again, no picture. :) Total for food from Amazon: $51.97 7. Wal-Mart On October 24, Auggie and I went to Wal-mart to finish picking up our WIC items for the month. I also got 8 pie crusts, coffee creamer, fritos, a 4-pound chunk of Colby jack cheese, and a jar of jelly. I always check for meat markdowns at Walmart because that’s one way I save a lot on meat for our family. This day I got a roast for $4.92 per pound, which is a higher than my preferred price point for meat, but still a really good price for beef. I also got four big packages of boneless chicken thighs marked down to just $2.02 or $1.98/pound. AMAZING! I checked out and loaded the van, then Auggie and I went in for round two – a cart full of fruits and veggies. WIC covered most of the produce cost that day. I got frozen fruit for smoothies, frozen peas, green beans, and corn, frozen fajita veggies, fresh baby carrots, regular carrots, Caesar salad, broccoli, cilantro, potatoes, spring mix, spinach, mandarins, pears, grapes, mushrooms, blueberries, and bananas. Total out of pocket at Wal-mart: $113.63 — > Without WIC, our total this month would have been closer to $1,545. <—– Running totals for 2024: January: $1,178 February: $849 March: $1,356 April: $1148 May: 1091 June: $1,121 July: $1,190 August: $1,611 September: $1,218 October: $1,345 Filed Under: Big Family Food, Feeding the Family Tagged With: aldi, costco, grocery budget, healthy eating, hy-vee, large family grocery spending, sam's, wal-mart Shelby H. says November 1, 2024 at 11:13 am I always enjoy reading about how you manage grocery shopping for a big family! Your tips and budget breakdowns are so helpful. As a mother and a carpet cleaner I know how important it is to find ways to save money and make things stretch. Thanks for sharing your insights—it’s always inspiring! Loy says November 1, 2024 at 5:40 pm Thanks for the tip on the pizza crusts. I have added a package to my November shipment. I always enjoy reading any of your posts. Megan H. says November 4, 2024 at 5:10 pm I want to let everyone know those 12″ pizza crusts are available at Dollar Tree for only $1.25 each! They’re available in-store in my area (NE Oklahoma). They’re also available on their website – a case of 20 for $25. They also sell the smaller 7″ crusts in a 2-pack. https://www.dollartree.com/golden-home-ultra-thin-pizza-crusts-12/182986 Your email address will not be published.
