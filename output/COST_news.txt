by IR Staff posted Friday, November 15, 2024 at 1:51 PM EST Black Friday Sony camera sales have landed! Although Sony have branched out into myriad other products besides, they're still one of the top dogs when it comes to both photography and video cameras, as well as the lenses to go with them. See below for the finest deals you'll see all year on these products, plus some advice from us on what you should bear in mind when shopping during this period. Sony Alpha 7 IV Full-frame Mirrorless Camera (body only): $400 OFF at - B&H - Amazon Sony FE 50mm f/1.2 GM: $100 OFF at - B&H - Amazon Sony FE 35mm f/1.4 GM: $100 OFF at - B&H - Amazon Sony FE 40mm f/2.5 G: $50 OFF at - B&H - Amazon Sony FE 14mm f/1.8 GM: $100 OFF at - B&H - Amazon Sony FE 50mm f/1.4 GM: $100 OFF at - B&H - Amazon Black Friday deals on Sony cameras typically start appearing in early to mid-November, as many retailers launch their early Black Friday sales in the weeks leading up to the main event. The biggest discounts are usually available on Black Friday itself, which is the day after Thanksgiving, and continue through Cyber Monday. Retailers like Amazon, B&H Photo Video, Adorama, and Best Buy often begin teasing or releasing discounts on Sony cameras, lenses, and accessories well before the official Black Friday date, so it’s a good idea to start monitoring prices early to secure the best deals. Yes, Black Friday is one of the best times to find deals on Sony cameras, lenses, and accessories. During this period, retailers like B&H Photo Video, Adorama, Amazon, and Best Buy compete to offer some of the year's steepest discounts on Sony gear, including popular models like the Sony Alpha mirrorless cameras and G-Master lenses. You can often find bundle deals that include extra lenses, memory cards, or camera bags at no additional cost, making it an excellent time to maximize value. While Black Friday offers significant savings, the discounts often depend on the product category. Entry-level and mid-range Sony cameras, older models, and discontinued lenses tend to see the most aggressive price cuts. However, newer and high-end models, like the Sony A7R V or Sony FX3, might not be as heavily discounted. All things considered though, Black Friday invariably provides the widest selection of deals in one concentrated shopping window. Several retailers are expected to offer deals on Sony cameras, lenses, and accessories this Black Friday, both online and in-store. B&H Photo Video and Adorama are top destinations, offering discounts on Sony Alpha cameras, lenses, and bundles, often including accessories like memory cards and camera bags. Amazon is another excellent option, featuring a wide range of Black Friday deals, including lightning deals on popular models, lenses, and bundles. You may also find discounts on refurbished Sony products. Best Buy frequently offers promotions on Sony Alpha cameras, point-and-shoot models, and kits, sometimes including extras like tripods or batteries. For members, Costco often provides value-packed bundles on Sony cameras with accessories, especially entry-level and mid-range models. Walmart, though more limited in selection, typically features deals on Sony point-and-shoot cameras and entry-level mirrorless models. Additionally, the Sony Store itself often runs Black Friday promotions, offering discounts on cameras, lenses, and accessories, with exclusive offers for direct purchases. Black Friday deals on Sony cameras and lenses usually begin in mid-November, with many retailers launching early Black Friday sales before the main shopping day. The steepest discounts are typically available from Black Friday itself, the day after Thanksgiving, through Cyber Monday. Some retailers extend these promotions into Cyber Week, lasting until the first few days of December. However, stock for popular Sony products, like Alpha mirrorless cameras and G-Master lenses, often sells out quickly, so it’s best to shop early. While some deals may linger after Cyber Week, the selection and savings tend to diminish as inventory runs low. My Father once told me when I was a young boy: 'never trust anyone in this life, they'll always let you down or stab you in the back, you can only rely on yourself'. Clearly he wasn't aware at the time of the stellar credibility of Imaging Resource when it comes to all things cameras. We have an extensive back catalogue of in-depth camera reviews, so we know what we're talking about in terms of the tech, plus a huge amount of collective experience covering the Black Friday sales period over previous years. Rest assured: you're in safe hands.

Title: Wondering How Much Cheaper Costco Groceries Are? I Did the Math

Our expert, award-winning staff selects the products we cover and rigorously researches and tests our top picks. If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Reviews ethics statement Costco is known for cheap groceries sold in bulk. If you're wondering how much you can save by joining the membership wholesale club for a year, I did the math to find out. A Costco membership can save you more than $1,000 yearly in groceries alone. Groceries are the biggest ongoing expense for most families after housing and they've seen an annoying tick up since the pandemic and all its supply chain chaos. One way to combat high supermarket prices is buying in bulk and nowhere is that more easily done that at Costco -- well, if you have one in your town or city that is. At Costco, groceries are packaged in larger quantities and sold at cheaper per-pound prices, meaning you can save major dough as long as you have the space to store a 50-pack of paper towels or a 20-pound bag of rice. Shopping at Costco also typically means fewer trips to the store, which will require less gas. To see exactly how much money can you save by buying bulk groceries from Costco, I decided to price out a grocery list at the wholesale club and a more typical grocery store. After running the numbers, it's possible to save over $1,000 in one year by shopping at Costco instead of a supermarket. Below is a breakdown of how I reached that figure. (And if you get a Costco Executive membership, you could save even more.) Using grocery list templates available online, I assembled a list of 25 typical, staple grocery items that are suitable for longer storage, either in the pantry, refrigerator or freezer. This ruled out most fresh produce with some exceptions. If you're hosting a large gathering, buying produce in bulk may be worthwhile. Bulk shopping doesn't mean buying a year's worth of groceries all at once, but I didn't include anything that wouldn't hold up well for at least a month, with the notion that bulk grocery shopping can be done less often. Bulk buying also requires spending more upfront, which is why Costco's per-item total is considerably higher than Stop & Shop's. Assuming either bi-weekly or monthly consumption of those staple grocery items for a household of one or two people, I came up with the approximate yearly consumption for each. I chose Stop & Shop to represent a conventional grocery retailer, as it's largely considered to be a quality store with median prices, and Costco to represent bulk buying, as its Kirkland Signature products have a bit of a following in their own right -- Costco is the Trader Joe's of the bulk set, for sure. Unless a national brand is otherwise indicated, I used Stop & Shop's SB brand, or the least expensive name-brand product for a given item, to compare to Costco's Kirkland Signature brand. For the Stop & Shop items, coming up with the yearly price for each item was a simple matter of multiplying by 26 for bi-weekly consumption, or 12 for monthly consumption. For Costco's items, I scaled the prices accordingly based on whatever package size Costco offers to indicate a yearly cost for the same amount of a given item. If you can afford the freezer space, buying meat in bulk will save you big money over the course of a year. Since I was primarily interested in food cost savings, I didn't factor in cleaning supplies, paper products or other items, but you can safely assume these also amount to big saving potential over the year when bought in bulk. Also, since my calculations were based on a small household, the bigger your household, the bigger the savings. Costco requires a membership to take advantage of its bulk savings and low-cost signature brands. A basic membership costs $65 a year and is valid at all locations. Read more about the different Costco membership options. The economics of buying in bulk is simple: The more you buy of something at one time, the less it costs per count or unit of weight. Producers, distributors and retailers are able to offer lower prices this way not only because bulk items often require less packaging, but also because for them it's a sure sale over a potential sale -- they'd rather have your money now, even at a discount, than parsed out over a period of time. Shelf-stable items including cereal, sauces and coffee make up some of the biggest savings when buying in bulk. Given this particular grocery list, buying in bulk would allow you to save over $1,000 during the course of a year, representing a 33% savings overall over conventional groceries. (In today's economy, it is worth mentioning that you also save gas money with fewer trips to the store.) In a few cases, the Stop & Shop item ended up being the cheaper option: organic milk, carrots, potatoes and frozen salmon filets, for example. In all of these cases, there wasn't a huge size difference between the conventional and bulk items. Milk is an especially good example, as it's still offered in a larger quantity at Costco, but there's only so much of it you can buy at one time without risking it spoiling, and so the bulk offering is comparatively modest. Costco also doesn't have a Kirkland brand offering of organic milk, whereas Stop & Shop does. The savings for bulk fresh produce were not as significant as pantry staples and shelf-stable groceries. Generally speaking, the larger the scale on the bulk item, the larger the savings. If you buy a 40-ounce quantity of Cheerios, for example, rather than the 12 ounces you get in a typical box, they become nearly 75% cheaper. Buying 25 pounds of white rice all at once instead of 2 pounds at a time saves you 60%. With at least a grand in savings available yearly for just a portion of your grocery list, even if you need to buy additional home storage to accommodate it, the verdict is clear: Bulk grocery shopping is well worth the effort. Some of the biggest savings by percentage come from shelf-stable and pantry items including chips, crackers, jarred sauce, rice and whole-bean coffee. These items are typically easier to store and less likely to spoil or deteriorate in quality. Buying pantry items in bulk from a discount grocer such as Costco represents a clear and risk-free strategy for saving money on your grocery bill bill the course of a year. If you're a Costco shopper, make sure you check out how to maximize your Costco savings, and how much you can save with a Costco Executive membership. And for more We Do the Math, check out how much you can save by shopping at Trader Joe's compared to other grocery stores, and if it's cheaper to buy meal kits than groceries.

When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. If you’re looking for a deal on anything Apple sells—an iPad, Apple Watch, AirPods, MacBook, or anything else, there’s no better time to get one than Black Friday. No matter what you’re looking to buy, you’re going to find a great price—possibly the lowest ever. The sales start earlier every year, but the best deals are usually seen between Black Friday (November 29) and Cyber Monday (December 2). However, we’re already seeing fantastic deals, so you might not want to wait. We’ll be updating this page regularly as more discounts come in and as soon as Apple announces its own Black Friday 2024 shopping event. Black Friday is a great time to get an Apple product for less, but the discounts come and go very quickly. Stay tuned to this page throughout the Black Friday weekend as we update you with the best prices on new Apple products as they arrive. Many of the best deals we see are on Amazon U.S. or Amazon U.K., but we’ll also be checking resellers such as Best Buy, B&H and Walmart in the U.S. and KRCS, AO, Argos, John Lewis, Currys, Laptops Direct and eBuyer in the U.K. Apple released new MacBook Pros with M4 chips in late October. At the same time, it upgraded the RAM in all MacBook Air models from 8GB to 16GB for the same starting prices, effectively a $200/£200 discount. So if you’re shopping make sure the model you’re buying has 16GB of RAM. We don’t recommend buying a model with 8GB of RAM even if it’s $200/£200 cheaper than the 16GB model. U.S. Foundry Additionally, Apple’s older MacBook Pro models are on clearance as retailers look to clear out remaining stock: U.K. Apple’s older MacBook models are on clearance at the following retailers: The iMac and Mac mini both received new M4 chips in October, with the Mac mini also getting a dramatic redesign that shrunk the case down to just 5 inches. Like the MacBooks, these new Macs now start at 16GB of RAM, an option that was previously an extra $200/£200. So be sure to double-check that you’re buying the updated model with an M4 processor. Older iMacs only offer 8GB of RAM, so the price should match that. Grab money off a new iMac. Foundry U.S. There are big savings are on the older models as well: U.K. In the U.K. when Apple announced the iMac and Mac mini in 2024 it dropped prices compared to the previous generation, so keep this in mind if considering a discount on an M3 model. These older models are also discounted: The AirPods 4 with and without ANC are Apple’s newest earbuds. Apple updated the AirPods Max with a USB-C port in September, but otherwise it’s the same as the Lightning model. And while the AirPods Pro 2 are a couple of years old, Apple added a new feature in iOS 18,1 that lets it work as a hearing aid. We usually see some tremendous savings on the standard AirPods over Black Friday. You may also see a blowout deal on the older models, but unless you’re on a very tight budget, our advice is to spring for one of the AirPods 4 models on sale even if they cost more. AirPods 4 are Apple’s newest earbuds and are already on sale. Petter Ahrnstedt U.S. U.K. There are also savings on older models: Mike Sawh Apple launched the Apple Watch Series 10 with a slightly larger screen in September 2024 as well as a new black color for the Apple Watch Ultra. Traditionally, any savings around $50 is an excellent deal. U.S. U.K. Apple updated all of its iPads in 2024 with the exception of the 10th-gen entry-level model (though it did get a price cut to $349). The iPad mini was the most recent model to get a refresh, with a new chip and 8GB of RAM. We are seeing some good deals on new iPads. Foundry U.S. U.K. U.S. Most iPhone deals in the U.S. are through carriers and require a trade-in or adding a new line. You can read our best Black Friday iPhone deals roundup for more information. U.K. David Price / Foundry In October, Apple updated its Mac accessories with USB-C ports but didn’t bring any other changes. If you’re buying a new Apple Pencil the Apple Pencil Pro is the newest model and compatible with the iPad Pro, iPad Air, and iPad mini. The USB-C Apple Pencil is also compatible with these models as well as the 10th-gen iPad, but doesn’t have squeeze gestures or magnetic charging. U.S. U.K. Every year Apple holds a shopping event from Black Friday (November 29) to Cyber Monday (December 2). However, since Apple rarely discounts its products, the event consists of gift card offers rather than actual savings. The newest products are excluded, so don’t expect any offers on the iPhone 16 or new MacBooks, but in 2023 the Apple Watch Series 9 was included. In 2023 you could get gift cards for the following amounts with the following purchases made on Apple’s U.S. site or Apple’s U.K. site. Stay tuned to Macworld throughout November to find the best deals as they arrive. But if you’re looking for a specific color or capacity, you can check out the following retailers.

Title: The Influencers Going Viral in Aisle 8

Time Published: 2024-11-14T13:00:00Z

With young people in the grip of a cost-of-living crisis, TikTok creators are turning grocery runs into rich-girl-coded productions—and followers are eating it up. I’m sitting in a Costco parking lot, staring at my Instacart app. It’s my ﬁrst week as a shopper, and all morning long, I’ve been at supermarkets in the sprawling, affluent community of Summerlin, Nevada, locations where the algorithm has detected a high likelihood that a customer will enlist my services. Except no one has, which means I’m currently making less than the $22 I spent on the insulated grocery bag Instacart recommended as part of its “best practices.” I have 18 miles of gas left. Anxiety is starting to kick in. I open TikTok and type “Instacart how to get orders”—and instead get my first taste of a genre that will ultimately suck me in for weeks. The initial video I stumble on shows a young woman named Shelly Kowatch in skintight workout gear surrounded by groceries in her kitchen. She and her husband “fucked up real bad,” she explains, holding up a large cardboard box of items, and blew $737.14 on a single Costco trip. With naughty delight, she displays the items one by one: frozen açaí packs, chicken sausage, turkey bacon, a whole watermelon, yogurt tubes, a jumbo pack of cream cheese, guacamole packs, and on and on. “There’s so much shit, I can’t even keep it organized right now,” she says. I’m at once mesmerized and unsettled, because what should be the blandest of content—a trip to Costco, the decidedly unglamorous warehouse club known for its discounted prices—is suddenly pinging my lifestyle envy. I skim the video’s 668 comments and see I’m not alone. “How do you afford thisss,” one viewer writes, adding two crying-face emojis. Another chimes in, “My broke ass couldn’t.” Says someone else, “I hope I can eventually be at the point where I accidentally spend $700 at Costco.” And that’s when I get it: It’s not the store itself that feels so seductive; it’s the idea of being able to stock up at all. In this economy? As a grad student in Las Vegas (and with Nevada having the country’s fourth-highest household grocery costs), I can attest it’s become very difficult to put food on the table with the $30,000 annual stipend I get for teaching and other academic duties. Hence my Instacart gig—and my insta-fascination with this budding corner of TikTok. Soon, through hashtags like #SupermarketHaul and #LuxuryGroceries, I’m scrolling through thousands of videos geared toward evoking a strange yearning. Some are like that first one, almost normcore in their casual redefinition of excess. Others catapult viewers across the ever-expanding wealth divide into an otherworldly domain where you can (vicariously) spend $88 on edible sea moss gel. But all these young female influencers cruising the aisles with nary a care underline a unifying truth: For a lot of us, the act of buying the exact foods we like, of nourishing ourselves on our own terms, now feels like an increasingly rarefied one. Back in that parking lot, my Instacart finally buzzes with an order. A customer has purchased a single rotisserie chicken…and nothing more. I’ll earn just $14 for delivering it, but I don’t feel I have much choice. I go inside, pick up the bird, and drive 40 minutes to a neighborhood almost 20 miles away. As instructed, I leave the bag outside a beautiful stucco house. I spend my $14 on gas, go home, lie on the floor, and watch more grocery content. People have always been obsessed with how the “haves” spend their money, a spectator sport driven by fascination, envy, sometimes bitterness. As a millennial raised on the internet, I’ve been watching luxury unboxings since the dawn of YouTube influencer culture: Sephora outings with unlimited budgets, ribbon-tied packages from Hermès—videos that served viewers like myself a thrilling peek at devil-may-care consumption. What kind of person spends such ridiculous sums on their face? I’d wonder. But also: How incredible would that be? Pummeled by an affordability crisis that has engulfed everything from housing to health care, young adults have only dialed up the digital window-shopping. A recent survey found that Gen Z now devotes over three hours a day, more than any other generation, to browsing fantasy purchases online. Think: historic homes that cost 200 times your annual rent, bucket-list vacations at 5-star resorts, Jil Sander boots. And now...ground beef? A pound of the stuff costs 43 percent more than it did four years ago. In fact, U.S. food prices have climbed so steeply—25 percent on average between 2019 and 2023—that in August, presidential nominee Kamala Harris announced an economic policy platform that would include the first-ever federal ban on grocery price gouging. Recent research suggests that young women struggle with food insecurity at higher rates than young men, meaning we’re less likely to get the basic nutrition we need for a healthy life. All of which makes what’s happening on TikTok feel even more dystopian. Brooke Baevsky, a 29-year-old private chef in Los Angeles catering to celebrities like Paris Hilton and Adam Sandler, has built a 732,000-strong social following with a stream of stridently aspirational supermarket content. She often records herself shopping for goods at the high-end grocer Erewhon, which has 10 locations across Los Angeles. In a video from March, Baevsky fills two carts, then holds a long scroll of a receipt in front of the camera. The total is over $2,900. A viral upload from last spring with more than 638,000 Likes shows Baevsky sourcing ingredients for a pizza appetizer a client requested. Into her cart go organic figs, adaptogenic mushroom powders, gluten-free flour, $35 balsamic vinegar, a $42 flask of olive oil, and two $26 bottles of purified water, all on top of the extra-extra-special ingredients Baevsky purchased elsewhere: $200 caviar, New Zealand manuka honey, edible 24-karat gold flakes. “Did I feel poor after watching this? Yes,” one commenter writes. “Did I enjoy watching it? Also yes.” Baevsky acknowledges her content acts like an irresistible lens into the country’s sharpening class disparities. “People will go to these stores as tourists just to see them, like a museum, and they’re like, Who buys this stuff? What is it used for? So I kind of answer that question,” she tells me. And she’s blunt about what makes a successful haul video: “showing the outlandish foods that most people in the country do not have.” On other TikTok accounts, creators make sticker shock into a game. A May video with 10,600 comments stars user Vanessa Nagel and a companion at an Erewhon location trying to estimate the price of a large container of prepared mixed berries. One guesses $19; the other guesses $24. Real price: $41.18. It’s a little rage-bait-y (“This is the Hunger Games,” one commenter declares), yet viewers can’t look away. During an anthropological visit to an Erewhon this summer, I myself witnessed multiple groups of young women filming their bewilderment over prices...and gawking at the “real” customers. “Are you from Pretty Little Liars?” a teen girl yelled at a handsome man perusing Wagyu beef with his Australian shepherd. In stark contrast to all this, Baevsky stresses to me that she teaches after-school cooking classes for families facing food insecurity, work that’s close to her heart. She grew up in a western Massachusetts county where nearly half of all households currently lack reliable access to nutritious food. On her social channels, she makes a point to integrate cooking tips for followers on any budget. But nothing does numbers quite like the fantasy excursions. A couple of summers ago, I spent my school hiatus in Los Angeles pretending to be someone with money. That wasn’t my intention—I was supposed to be living frugally while researching a novel—but soon after I arrived, I began living as a woman who takes hot yoga classes and scours flea markets for vintage denim. The bougie neighborhood supermarket was a constant lure, with its imported cheeses, cold-pressed juices, and fresh-cut flowers. I wanted so badly to be the kind of person who could buy these things that I found myself taking out my credit card again and again. TikTok has no shortage of grocery girlies engaged in similar games of economic make-believe, but today’s cohort comes with a twist of wry transparency and a (grim? refreshing?) recognition that sustaining this lifestyle would actually be impossible. One post filmed outside a Whole Foods shows creator Alina Ayoub pushing a cart of brown paper bags. White text across the screen reads, “Cosplaying a rich housewife who only eats organic and doesn’t care about the financial repercussions of an $8 cucumber.” “Cosplaying L.A. influencer is my new favorite hobby,” a user named Kayla Ronquillo captioned a March clip. The video shows her posted up in an outdoor seating area at Erewhon with some of the store’s buzziest items: buffalo cauliflower, gluten-free mac and cheese, the spicy tuna sushi sandwich (“of course”), and a Winnie Harlow x Steens Honey x Erewhon Island Glow Smoothie made with organic blue spirulina powder, red dragon fruit, and vanilla collagen peptides. “Don’t ask me how much I spent,” she says to the camera. To do so would disturb this open-source identity experiment. Some videos incorporate actual aspects of dress-up. At another Whole Foods, registered dietitian Taylor Grasso is seen costumed in a jean jacket and baseball cap, tousled waves spilling out as she saunters down an aisle. Her mission: “pretend you’re a hot, rich suburban mom who buys all her groceries from here.” A July TikTok from beauty influencer Anna Annora offers an aesthetic manual for this kind of consumer, what she calls “the Trader Joe’s girl phenomenon,” where women somehow appear glowy, gorgeous, and spiritually unbothered as they browse for yogurt and toilet paper. All it takes are 12 simple steps: a faint wash of stain dabbed on lips and cheekbones, a bit of spot concealer, strategic shimmery contour, filled-in brows, a smoky smudge of eyeliner, nose stippled with a ColourPop Freckle Pen in Soft Brown, setting powder, a second application of blush, a quick lash curl, mascara, buffed-out lip liner, and a swipe of gloss. Go even deeper into the valley of GroceryTok and you’ll find more echoes of OG beauty and style content. A July haul from creator Kiki Somers features a package of free-range organic chicken breasts presented for the camera like an eyeshadow palette. Other users hold up meatballs, milk, and ice pops in similar fashion. A January clip from user Danielle Demi captures an ironic “unboxing” in which she fawns over a few items from Whole Foods, like a $9 glass vessel of sesame-ginger salad dressing. Drumming her manicured hand on a metallic package of butter, she adds, “Oooh, gold.” Intentionally or not, these creators are performing a sort of reverse engineering, in which everyday fare attains divine status. Something must explain these ungodly prices, the videos seem to imply. Sometimes, like with that butter, it happens in passing. Other times, there’s an entire content universe devoted to a specific luxe item, like Oishii-brand Omakase strawberries, native to the Japanese Alps and known for their creamy sweetness. The Oishii company claims to have designed the optimal year-round growing climate at “the world’s largest indoor vertical strawberry farm”—in New Jersey—and delegates harvesting duties to state-of-the-art robots. For $11.99 to $19.99, you get a sleek container of 11 berries, each nestled in its own protective divot. “Worth it just for the packaging alone,” Meg Radice of @TheVIPList says in a TikTok review. In an April TikTok with 1.1 million Likes, creator Lizzie Dushaj conducts a taste test of Penny Pound Ice–brand cocktail ice from Erewhon. The bag contains eight 2.4-inch spheres of frozen water and costs $30. “Oh my god—this looks like a crystal ball,” she says, holding up a melting orb. “I can’t afford bread,” someone writes in the comments. Lifestyle creator Kayla Brown is done with freewheeling supermarket splurges, even though she once was somewhat known for them. Several years ago, the 29-year-old began sharing grocery hauls on TikTok and admits she used to shop with a money-is-no-object mentality. “I was just like, Oh, this color matches the fridge; this would be great in the TikTok where I do the restock,” she tells me. Then her followers started to push back. “The comments would be like, ‘Well, this is not realistic’; ‘It’s so expensive’; ‘How much did you spend on this?’” The discourse helped Brown rethink her habits—and content strategy. Lately, in an effort to be more relatable (and cut down on food waste), she’s been shopping with a list, and her posts offer a different kind of thrill: sensory delights minus existential stress. In a June video, you hear the pleasing clack of soft-drink cans being placed into a cart, the rattle of shelled pistachios, the soft thump of chicken cutlets hitting the heap, and the rustle of matching cream-colored shopping bags sliding perfectly into a car trunk, all with a soft overdub of Sabrina Carpenter’s “Please Please Please.” Here, the supermarket is not a seat of modern financial anxiety. Instead, viewers feel like they’re in a gentle cocoon, a dreamy realm where their debit card will never be declined. “So satisfying,” someone says in the comments. Brown, who is based in Salt Lake City, has a specific process for stirring such responses. After she puts together a video, she closes her eyes, takes in the audio element, and makes adjustments much like a music producer would. “It’s like a rhythm or a beat,” she says. “Is this clip too quiet? Was there a squeaky noise that wasn’t satisfying?” She also has certain visual trademarks, like showing a bright-red Target shopping cart at the outset, a cue that gets casual users to stop and watch, she theorizes. And she mostly keeps her face out of frame. “You scroll upon this video and it’s kind of a relief, like you’re not trying to connect with another human,” Brown explains. “You’re resetting your mindset. It’s a dopamine release.” Others are leveraging a similar approach, a tranquilizing take on grocery procurement that you don’t need a lot of money to experience IRL...or do you? I enjoy a similar flood of calm while watching an April grocery video from YouTuber Paige Turner, where I’m treated to a whispery voyage through a near-deserted Whole Foods. Turner taps her long silver fingernails against jars of organic fruit spread and packages of ancient grain crackers. She runs her fingers over inscribed bars of natural soap. The sense of tactile access, of actually holding items in hand, is very much part of the fantasy—at least for viewers like me. At the chain supermarket where I shop in Las Vegas, entire aisles of items are locked up behind anti-theft panels, which seems to be a growing norm in lower-income communities. No longer can you freely pick things up, read the labels, and decide if you want them. You have to ask permission, over and over again, from the employee with the key. After a supermarket haul comes the great kitchen restock. This is the genus of TikTok grocery content that delivers the intense payoff of watching an empty fridge suddenly fill with food. It represents a potent promise fulfilled: In this house, no one goes to bed hungry. For me, the queen of kitchen restocks is Summer Reign Henning, an Atlanta-based content creator and entrepreneur with 2 million TikTok followers. While home organizing is her broader specialty, kitchen restocks are her highest-performing fodder. Her most viral to date, a 2023 video with more than 40 million views, opens with her husband, Ryan, steam cleaning the family’s empty fridge in preparation for a $1,000 influx. From there, Henning removes each item from its original packaging and transfers it to one of many clear containers. There are carafes for milk and juice, a multi-tier egg tray, crisper bins for greens, pull-out bins for snacks, and a special hourglass-style pickle jar that allows you to separate spears from their brine. Some of Henning’s followers gravitate to the Pinterest-y appeal of her system—the creation of order in a chaotic world. And then there are viewers like me, who dream of opening their fridges to find tasty things in seemingly infinite supply. “It looks like a storefront,” Henning says. “Everything is easily accessible. The drink dispenser—when you take one can out, another comes behind it.” Pure magic. “I want my future like this low-key,” one viewer writes. “Literally the level of adulthood I’m trying to get to,” comments another. A number of fans beg Henning to just adopt them. After speaking with her, I reflect on the summer I’d had before I started the Instacart job. I was back in Los Angeles to revise that novel. I got a cat-sitting gig in a wealthy area near Griffith Park and arranged to stay in the stylish apartment of the owner—a retired set decorator—for free. She’d left a few items in her fridge for me: sliced turkey, Swiss cheese, sourdough. Should be enough for a sandwich, read a yellow Post-it note. It was a far cry from Henning’s epic restocks, but it was enough to make me feel cared for. That too was magic. So what if I was an interloper in that nice neighborhood? Maybe I wasn’t cosplaying anymore. My university operates a food pantry for students, staff, and faculty. I applaud its existence and yet have always stopped short of going in. Too embarrassed to admit I might need this kind of support, I’ve driven past, not slowing down, not wanting the shame of seeing my own car in the parking lot. Now I wonder if the real aspirational move might be pulling up. On a whim, I search “food pantry haul” on TikTok. I click on a July video from a creator named Alyshia Abbascia titled “Food Pantry Haul as a Single Mom.” The clip shows Abbascia arriving home with bags of groceries from a North Carolina food pantry. As she places them on the floor, she says, “This is something that I never thought I’d be sharing on the internet. It’s something I don’t even share with the people that I know.” Viewers, myself included, are glad she did. There are more than 1,800 comments. “I would love to be part of your village and place a grocery pickup order for you if you’d let me.” “I am so proud of you. You are doing the best that you can and you should be celebrated.” “No shame, Queen. You are not alone. It’s hard as hell out here, but we are all holding on!” I watch a few other food pantry hauls. Creators marvel over boxes of potatoes, spaghetti, lentils, and nuts, emphasizing how happy they are to have overcome the self-consciousness of seeking help. The videos contain zero fantasy: no talk of product aesthetics, no ASMR, no influencer vibes. Here, at the end of the scroll, I may have finally found my place, where all strawberries—any strawberries—taste amazing.
