Title: Lehman’s Cordless Mason Jar Vacuum Sealer, by Mike in Alaska

I recently bought a Mason Jar vacuum sealer from the Lehman’s Non-Electric store located in Kidron, Ohio. The following is my informal review. Disclaimer: I paid full retail price for this jar sealer. Lehman’s has not paid me or otherwise compensated me, nor do I represent them. I am simply offering to readers of the blog our experience with this product. We have bought many items from Lehman’s over the years, from cast iron products, food, candies, to Aladdin Lamps. The quality of their products is what we call “generational quality”; that is, you can pass their products down to the next generation. (Except for the candy and food items. Those don’t get by me for long.) We have an All-American Pressure Canner we bought from Lehman’s several years ago., If you’re going to preserve liquid foods, then use that method and save the Pressure Vacuum canner in this review for prolonging the storage of dry goods and foods. We use the pressure canner for our meats, fish, vegetables, and fruit, since that method is the safest way to preserve those types of foods. For this device, I decided to buy it because it was not very expensive, even with shipping to the interior of Alaska. The total cost was $115.97 and this included the shipping costs of $32.99 and an extra-large pack of new jar lids. It seemed like an inexpensive way to store dry items that we can buy in quantity like cereal, grains, and other stuff that we would buy but not use quickly enough that it wouldn’t go stale sitting on the shelf in the original box or whatever container that the manufacturer shipped it in. For this review, I used a bag of beeswax beads that I had procured a long time ago and felt like it would be a good first time use in learning about this sealer. Now that I’ve had a chance to use it with a product I’m not worried about spoiling or messing up, I am going to start using it to store other items like sugar, flour, and dry food items that we use regularly. Once I’ve put up a number of items, I will put them on the shelf in our storage room. (My garage that has turned into a “root cellar” since it is kept above freezing in the long, dark winters of the arctic, and stays at around 50 degrees to 55 degrees in the summer since it is so well insulated.) The instructions that come with the unit are not going to dazzle you with their brilliance. But then that’s just the mind of a fuzzy-brained old guy, so I’ll let you be the judge of them, should you buy one of these critters. I read them several times before it dawned on me that I was overthinking them. There are apparently other attachments you can buy that allow you to use this vacuum pump on bags and such and so the instructions mix in those operations in the beginning and so I was looking for what was missing; or so I thought. No, not missing, I just didn’t order them and probably won’t since we already have a nice unit that was made for sealing bags of food and such. My next project to seal beyond the bee’s beeswax beads will be my personal mix of nuts, grains, and dehydrated fruit in what I like as a munchy kit for use on the trail or on the road. So, once I read the whole operations manual and realized what they were trying to get across, it turned out to be much easier and simpler than I initially thought. All the inventory, diagrams and such for the accessories should have been listed in the back of the operator’s guide and just get to the good stuff of the basic operation on jars up front. Embarrassing for me to admit, but it is so easy that even a grizzled old caveman (or woman) can do it. Why bee wax? Because my bride of many years who is very wise to my ways and antics said no to food stuff for now. She didn’t understand why I bought that bag of bee’s wax beads in the first place and since it was long ago and far away in another time domain neither do I? But I’m sure it was for a good reason and seemed like a good thing at the time. Besides, why experiment on food that I plan to eat? Next up will be flour and such. Once I figured out how this contraption works, I went ahead and plugged it into the wall wart charging unit. It comes with the charging cord a C-type USB cord with a normal USB plug on one end and the C type on the other end. I happened to have a two-place wall wart charging unit, so I plugged the sealer in and let it charge up until the green light that was blinking when it arrived went to solid green. You could use a computer USB port to charge it with, but also any wall wart that can output 5 volts to charge up the unit will work as well. It took about 20 minutes to fully charge this critter, and I haven’t used it enough yet to see how many cycles it will run until it runs down. Sealing the jar of wax only took about 10 to 15 seconds and I repeatedly did the process just for the practice and yet the charge light is still green. First, if you’re going to be sealing anything you plan to eat then you must first sterilize the jars. The usual hot bath canning method will be the best way to do this, and I highly recommend that you do this. As for the beeswax, I have no plans to eat that stuff, so I didn’t sterilize the jar. The wax came in a zip lock baggie, so I’ll just put it back in the bag and use the jar for real food. Once you have sterilized your jars, lids, and rings just as you would if you were going to pressure cook food stuff set them aside to dry completely. Place whatever you plan to seal like flour, sugar, oats or such in the jar you are using. This machine will seal any regular Mason or Ball jar with the wide-mouth lids or regular mouth lids. The unit came with new lids made by Superb Canning Lids Company, and I used their lids as well as a used Mason lid that I had on the jar to begin with. It didn’t seem to matter which brand of lid I used but the Superb brand was there and in addition to the six lids the unit comes with (3-large and 3- small) I also bought the “Bakers Dozen” package of Superb Lids as well because we are low on lids and they are out of stock up here locally. That package has 12 dozen lids in it in a mix of large and small types. They were not very expensive which for us up here in the hinterboonies is relative to needs and availability. For folks on the outside (the rest of the USA) it is probably not an issue. Fill the jar to just below the rounded top of the jar, place the lid on the jar and use the three-finger method to tighten down the ring. Do not over-tighten as this will prevent a seal from being formed. I did that on purpose just to know that it’s possible to mess this up. Once the lid is set with the ring attached, push the power button in the middle of the pump, simply push the vacuum sealer down on the jar top until it bottoms out. There are some rubber seals inside that unit which are there to seal the jar into the pump. Do not try to seal a jar without the ring on it as the jar will not seal and that lid will remain inside the seal area as the ring comes off. Yeah, I did that. You’ll see at the top of the pump after you push the power button in the center of the pump that there will be a display in blue to indicate the process you want to perform, either Mason Jar, Accessory, External Vac, or Marinating. Just hold pressure on the jar and push the Mason Jar button and let the pump run until it stops. As I said the jars of wax only took about 10 to 15 seconds to seal. Remove the pump and press in the middle of the lid of the jar you just sealed. It should make a popping sound, and this shows that a good seal has been made. When we use the pressure canner the jars will pop as they cool down indicating a good vacuum seal, this is the same as for the lid popping when you seal it with the pump. That’s it, finished. So, is it worth it? That you will need to decide for yourself. It’s fast, it’s simple and it’s inexpensive. I am going to spend the weekend canning (vacuum sealing) some food stuff. I’ll mark and date the jar lids and set them in the storage room and let you know in a few months just how well this experiment has fared. When we go to the store, usually Safeway but occasionally Costco, we don’t buy the larger quantity of items. So, here is my devious plan; go to Costco, get that big bag of macaroni, rice, sugar, or whatever and can it in the jars in amounts that we will consume it in as opposed to opening that bulk bag, jar, or whatever container the stuff comes in and can it in the smaller storage quantity for our current use needs. The problem is that when I go shopping, I don’t go for just a gallon of milk or a loaf of bread. When I go to Costco it is for $400 or more and I try to avoid the bulk size deals that are a better buy in terms of quantity versus cost. We don’t have 10 children to feed, so there’s that. Now I am thinking that all those extra canning jars setting around have a good use and storing the dry stuff I can buy in the bulk size and break down into quantities we would use is where this vacuum sealer may well prove to be a good deal. If you are considering buying one of these units, then I recommend it. It appears to be made of good quality material, it is easy to use and should last a long time if it is kept stored clean. Lehman’s has always stand behind their products and I’ve never had any issues with them for breakage or poor-quality products.

Title: Target’s problems are escalating | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Target was already facing a very public revolt from some of its most loyal customers. Now it’s warning about tariffs. The company said Wednesday that sales fell last quarter, driven in part by customer backlash to Target’s reversal on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs. Target also cut its guidance as President Donald Trump’s tariffs push up costs for the company. Target’s sales at stores open for at least a year tumbled 3.8% last quarter. Fewer customers visited Target and spent less when they shopped. Target also cut its financial outlook, a sign Target’s problems won’t go away quickly. The company expects sales to decline by low single-digits this year. The company announced that it established a multi-year “Enterprise Acceleration Office” to speed up growth plans, and it reshuffled its executive team. “We faced several additional headwinds this quarter, including five consecutive months of declining consumer confidence, uncertainty regarding the impact of potential tariffs, and the reaction to the updates we shared on (DEI) in January,” Target CEO Brian Cornell said on a call with analysts Wednesday. Cornell warned of “massive potential costs” from tariffs, but said the retailer could offset them by diversifying suppliers, adjusting products – and hiking prices, if necessary. “We have many levers to use in mitigating the impact of tariffs and price is the very last resort,” he said. Target’s stock (TGT) dropped 7% during pre-market trading Wednesday. Target’s stock has declined 37% over the past year. Cornell acknowledged in a recent email to staff that it has been “a tough few months” between the retail economy “headlines, social media and conversations that may have left you wondering,” the Minnesota Star Tribune reported. (Target confirmed the email to CNN.) Cornell said Target’s culture and commitment to staff has not changed. “I recognize that silence from us has created uncertainty, so I want to be very clear: We are still the Target you know and believe in,” Cornell said. Boycotts over Target’s DEI reversal hurt Target’s business. On January 24, days into Donald Trump’s presidency, Target announced it was eliminating hiring goals for minority employees, ending an executive committee focused on racial justice and making other changes to its diversity initiatives. Target said it had a new strategy called “Belonging at the Bullseye” and the company remained committed to “creating a sense of belonging for our team, guests and communities.” Target also stressed the need for “staying in step with the evolving external landscape.” But the decision angered supporters of diversity and inclusion policies, who felt blindsided by Target. Target had been a champion of diversity initiatives and LGBTQ rights. Customers online protested Target’s decision and Anne and Lucy Dayton, the daughters of one of Target’s co-founders, called the company’s actions “a betrayal.” Target faced a 40-day consumer boycott during Lent led by Rev. Jamal Bryant, a prominent Atlanta-area megachurch pastor, over its DEI rollback. Protestors picketed outside Target headquarters in Minneapolis and other Black leaders such as Rev. Al Sharpton supported boycott efforts. Target came under more pressure than other companies that rolled back DEI policies because Target had gone further in its DEI efforts, and it has a more progressive base of customers than those competitors. On CNN on Wednesday evening, Bryant said that though Target was the first business targeted, it wouldn’t be the last. He said he is aware of more than 17 companies that have rolled back DEI initiatives. “Another company is going to be coming on the radar the next couple of weeks,” he said. Target was a leading advocate for DEI programs in the business world in the years after George Floyd was murdered by police in the company’s home city of Minneapolis in 2020. Target also spent years building a public reputation as a progressive employer on LGBTQ issues. Tariffs and a consumer slowdown put even more pressure on Target. The chain stocks more nonessential merchandise compared to competitors such as Walmart (WMT) and Costco (COST). More than half of Target’s merchandise is discretionary and is at risk as consumers reign in spending. Around 50% of Target’s products are also imported from overseas, including an estimated 25% from China, leaving Target in a “challenging position,” Steven Shemesh, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in a note Wednesday. Tariffs may force Target to either absorb added costs, hurting its profit, or raise prices on consumers. Home Depot said Tuesday that it plans to keep most of its prices stable, despite Trump’s tariffs driving costs up. But tariffs may cause Home Depot to increase prices on select items and eliminate some product lines entirely. Walmart said last week that Trump’s tariffs are “too high” and it will raise prices on some items, prompting an angry response from Trump. “Walmart should STOP trying to blame Tariffs as the reason for raising prices throughout the chain,” Trump said over the weekend. “Between Walmart and China they should, as is said, “EAT THE TARIFFS,” and not charge valued customers ANYTHING. I’ll be watching, and so will your customers!!!” CNN’s Ramishah Maruf contributed to this story. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Title: Crazy-Good Ticket Deal for Disneyland’s 70th!
URL: https://www.disneytouristblog.com/costco-ticket-deal-disneyland-70th-anniversary-halloween-christmas-2025/
Time Published: 2025-05-20T23:39:15Z
Full Content:
Disney has released a new deal for Disneyland & California Adventure admission that beats the current general public 70th Anniversary discount, and offers a ‘fully loaded’ Park Hopper ticket with Lightning Lane Multi-Pass & more for a crazy-good price. Here are dates & details about the special offer, plus comparisons to other past & present ticket promos, an assessment of the value proposition, and more. For a limited time, guests can save ~$180 per person (!!!) on the purchase of a 3-Day Disneyland Park Hopper Ticket with Lightning Lane Multi Pass for only $150 per day. This special offer is valid for admission from May 20, 2025 through December 19, 2025, meaning it’s not just good for the summer of Disneyland’s 70th Anniversary, but also Halloween and Christmas! This ticket is $449.99 for all ages, and is a fully-loaded three-day Disneyland ticket with the Park Hopper option and LLMP. A standard multi-day Disneyland ticket with the same add-ons would cost $601 directly from Disney. Even the current 3-Day Disneyland Anniversary Ticket Deal costs $546 with the Park Hopper and Lightning Lane Multi Pass, making this fully-loaded deal ~$100 off that discounted price in an apples to apples comparison. As an added bonus, this new 70th deal includes a $30 Disney Dining Gift Card that can be used throughout Disneyland Resort! Of course, that assumes you want the Park Hopper and Lightning Lane Multi-Pass add-ons, and that you will eat a meal of food in the parks. It also assumes you want to visit Disneyland and DCA for three days, as opposed to longer. The 4-day version of the general public anniversary deal–which is the one Disneyland has been “pushing” guests towards by virtue of its superior per day pricing–costs $400 total or only $100 per day, making that the better deal if you’re looking for bottom-dollar pricing. However, that is very obviously not an apples to apples comparison. Once you include the Park Hopper and Lightning Lane Multi-Pass add-ons, the 4-Day Disneyland Anniversary Ticket Deal costs $623, or $155.75 per day. This ticket deal still comes in below that, at $150 per day (and again, includes that bonus $30 dining card). Of course, there’s a catch (isn’t there always?). This $449 fully-loaded Disneyland ticket deal is only available at Costco, while supplies last. Moreover, it’s only being sold in-store in select West Coast markets throughout California, as well as stores in Oregon and Washington. At present, it’s not available at stores in Arizona, Nevada, Utah, or beyond. (It comes up on an inventory check as either “sold out” or “no match found.”) We paid a visit to our local Costco in Orange County, where there’s a huge display and a total stock of 200 of these discounted Disneyland tickets. There was also a Costco employee lingering around the display, offering her “pitch” for the special offer. I kinda felt like Ron Swanson as she broke things down for me, but I politely bit my tongue and quietly listened to the spiel, which was mostly accurate-ish! Here’s the fine print on the Costco Disneyland 70th Anniversary Ticket Deal: Tickets valid for use beginning May 20, 2025 and expire December 19, 2025. Tickets may be used on nonconsecutive days. A ticket must be used by the same person on all days. Each ticket is valid for three (3) days of admission to both Disneyland Park and Disney California Adventure Park, including visits to both Parks on the same day. Each day of use constitutes one full day of use. Tickets are nonrefundable, may not be sold or transferred for commercial use and exclude activities/events separately priced. Offer may not be combined with other ticket discounts or promotions. Subject to restrictions and change or cancellation without notice. To enter a park, both a theme park reservation and a valid ticket for the same park on the same date are required. Check park availability by visiting disneytraveltradeinfo.com/dlrcalendar prior to purchase. Theme park reservations are limited, subject to availability, and are not guaranteed. Guests with a Park Hopper ticket must make a park reservation for the first theme park they wish to visit to begin their day; then they can cross over and switch between parks on the same day after 11:00 AM (subject to availability). The ability to visit the other park will be subject to that park’s capacity limitations, operational hours, closures and other restrictions, and is not guaranteed. One (1) $30 Disney Dining Card for each 3-Day Park Hopper Ticket purchased. Value of Disney Dining Card may not be applied toward the ticket price. Disney Dining Card is nonrefundable and redeemable only for food and beverages at participating locations within the Disneyland Resort, Walt Disney World Resort and other Disney Resorts located in the U.S. Certain parks, attractions, services, experiences and offerings may be modified, limited in availability or unavailable, and are subject to restrictions, and change or cancellation without notice. Park admission and offerings are not guaranteed. Select shows, performances, and experiences, including parades and nighttime spectaculars, will temporarily pause to make way for seasonal entertainment offerings, then resume at later dates. Check entertainment schedules before visiting. If the new Costco Disneyland Anniversary Ticket Offer isn’t for you due to travel dates or because you need longer duration tickets, see our 2025 Discount Disneyland Ticket Buying Guide for additional recommendations. There are a few notable details about this Costco ticket deal to which we want to draw your attention. First, this special offer does not have a “fuse,” which means you can use the first admission this summer for the 70th kickoff, once again between August and October for Halloween Time (see our Guide to Halloween Time at Disneyland), and then one final visit during Holiday Time at Disneyland (see our Guide to Christmas at Disneyland). Those are just examples–you could do all three days next week, during our favorite week of the year, or from December 17-19, 2025. Second, this Costco ticket deal has a longer eligibility window than we’ve seen for any ticket deal in recent memory. And by “recent memory,” I mean since 2016 when we started tracking these discounts. (It was back then that Costco offered a special DCA-only Annual Pass. Unsurprisingly, it was cheaper than this–but almost everything was a decade ago!) It’s unprecedented for a ticket deal like this to cover summer, Halloween and Christmas. It’s also unprecedented for a discount to encompass several popular holidays without blockouts. Fall Break/Columbus Day, Halloween, Veterans Day, and Thanksgiving are all fair game. You can use this through the third week in December, right before peak Christmas week crowds descend upon Disneyland. For reference, the current Disneyland Anniversary Ticket offer runs now through August 14, 2025. Given the early end of that offer (coupled with this Costco deal), we wouldn’t be surprised to see a special offer for late August through December 2025–but we also wouldn’t be surprised if it’s targeted at Californians, more expensive than this, or doesn’t cover all of these dates. Finally, it’s unclear whether this Costco deal is pulling park reservations from the same “bucket” as the new Disneyland Anniversary Ticket Offer or from regular full-price park tickets. Our assumption is the 70th promo. This is exactly how Magic Keys already work, as well as other recent ticket promos. So it’s really nothing new. Nevertheless, it’s important to understand because these ticket deals are popular–they always are, and that’s even when they’re just for California residents. This is more akin to last summer’s general public ticket deal, but being rolled out at the start of Disneyland’s 70th Anniversary. It thus stands to reason that this deal will be bought by a higher percentage of guests, meaning more people in this “pool” competing for the same reservations. As Disney warns, some dates are going to be difficult to book–even when availability is wide open for other ticket types. The good news is that Disneyland does reallocate reservation availability as demand dictates; the bad news is that they aren’t very good at it, and it can be very hit or miss (requiring a strong refresh game). Anyway, just bringing this to your attention because we know some people gloss over the terms and conditions, viewing that as CYA legal language that has no real bearing on the deal. Here, that’s only partially true. The way this new Disneyland Anniversary Ticket Offer works with park reservations is a typical legal disclaimer to avoid (another) lawsuit, but it’s also crucial for you to understand so you don’t end up with tickets you can’t use. The biggest impediments to this Disneyland 70th Anniversary Ticket Deal at Costco will presumably be a membership to the big-box warehouse store. If you’re more of a Sam’s Club house, this does you no good. Even if you are a Costco member, you might have issues purchasing this if you live outside of California, Washington or Oregon since it’s in-store only. When we asked an employee, they did indicate that inventory was limited and their store had received an initial stock of 200 tickets. They were unsure if the deal would be restocked, or if this was it–and it was over once it sold out. Waiting until you arrive in California for your vacation to buy these discounted tickets at Costco is a gamble. Not only because they might already be sold out, but because park reservations are required and those might be gone. If you’re a Costco member living on the West Coast and this special offer is available at your local store, this deal is pretty much a no-brainer. But if not, you might want to consider the current general public deal instead. As a reminder, the general public Disneyland 70th Anniversary Ticket Deal is available now through August 14, 2025. You can purchase tickets directly from Disney or buy this deal via Get Away Today with even greater savings. Here’s a pricing breakdown and other important details… 3-Day, 1-Park Per Day Ticket for $120 Per Day 4-Day, 1-Park Per Day Ticket for $100 Per Day In a normal year, there are two main types of ticket deals. There’s the summer one, which has morphed from a Golden State deal for all Californians to a general public discount in the last two years. Historically, the summer deal with the wider eligibility pool costs more. Before that, there’s the winter and spring special offer–which ran this year until May 15, 2025–that’s only available to Southern California residents. Disneyland has done this consistently for at least the last decade. It’s the much more established and longstanding deal–the summer discount is more recent addition during the post-reopening era. This year’s version of that SoCal resident deal is the best we’ve seen in a while, and is actually better than last year–and significantly so. It offers discount admission for as low as $67 per day on select days with the purchase of a 3-day, 1-park per day ticket. That deal beats this Costco in terms of bottom line price (which we assume matters to at least some degree if you’re in the market for discounted tickets), but not on an apples to apples basis once accounting for Park Hopping and Lightning Lane Multi-Pass. Since this Costco Disneyland 70th Anniversary Ticket Deal is unlike anything that came before it, I’m just going to share special offer ticket prices from the last several years and let them speak for themselves… 2025 SoCal Resident Winter & Spring Ticket Deal Prices: 2024 All Guest Summer & Fall Ticket Deal Prices: 2024 SoCal Resident Winter & Spring Ticket Deal Prices: 2023 California Resident Summer & Fall Ticket Deal Prices: 2023 SoCal Resident Winter & Spring Ticket Deal Prices: 2022 California Resident Summer & Fall Ticket Deal Prices: 2022 SoCal Resident Winter & Spring Ticket Deal Prices: 2021 California Resident Disneyland Ticket Deal Prices: 2020 SoCal Resident Disneyland Ticket Deal Prices: 2019 SoCal Resident Disneyland Ticket Deal Prices: 2018 SoCal Resident Disneyland Ticket Deal Prices: 2017 SoCal Resident Disneyland Ticket Deal Prices: 2016 SoCal Resident Disneyland Ticket Deal Prices: Ultimately, this Costco Disneyland 70th Anniversary Ticket Deal is a crazy-good deal if you’re at least semi-local and wanting to make a few visits to Disneyland and Disney California Adventure for the 70th Anniversary, Halloween, and Christmas. (For recommendations on when to do DLR, see our list of the Best & Worst Weeks to Visit Disneyland in 2025 & 2026.) That’s especially true if you want or need all of the bells and whistles on your admission, as this degree of discount is unprecedented in the last decade or so. What amounts to around $180 off per ticket is a tremendous savings, even if it does require buying the fully-loaded option with all of the add-ons. If you want longer duration tickets, live outside the West Coast, aren’t a Costco member, or are more concerned with getting the bottom-dollar price, there are better alternatives for you. Regardless, it’s great to see a discount that’s this aggressive, and better that what Disney is offering directly. This is surprising to see right as the 70th starts, and suggests that more deals are in the pipeline! Planning a Southern California vacation?

Hearing your feedback–even when you disagree with us–is both interesting to us and helpful to other readers, so please share your thoughts below in the comments! My new bride and I got ours at Costco yesterday. They still had some stock. Can’t believe this deal. $450 per ticket – $30 for Dining – $105 for LLMP =$315 for 3 days of park hopper = $105 per day of park hopping, valid on weekends. INSANE DEAL. We would have bought dining, LLMP, and park hopping anyway. And we would have used the tickets on weekends anyway. Going to go for my bday in August for 2 days, then probably a Christmastime visit in early December. Thanks for the tip, I was about to spend $1858 for 4 x 2 day tix with park hopper and LL so not only do I save some money, but get an extra day for future use and $120 in dining gift cards. The first Costco I went to was already sold out (this was yesterday and evening) but that store was able to locate other stores nearby that still had some. They only got 100 of them. Thanks for sharing your experience! It’s interesting to me that some stores received such little inventory–really curious as to whether this will be restocked, or if it’s gone-gone once it sells out. If the latter, this deal will be dead by Memorial Day. Confirming that at least 1 Costco in WA was restocked today. This is two years in a row where I’ve scrambled to buy tickets from reputable third party companies when price hikes are announced only to see much, much better deals come later on (last year was WDW but this time it’s DLR.) Regrets. Is there any strategy on *when* to buy tickets? After this happening two years in a row, I think I’m going to avoid the price hike rush and just put off purchasing as long as I can…I think. “Is there any strategy on *when* to buy tickets?” Up until the last two years, the optimal strategy was buying before the price increase. And at least for Disneyland, Get Away Today would match future prices if there was a discount that was better. (That’s not going to happen here, as this deal is not direct-from-Disney.) The smart approach is still buying pre-price increase IMO. But clearly, it’s not always going to work out to be the lowest price on all tickets. Does anyone know about who is allowed to use the purchased tickets? My wife and I who live in Pennyslyvania are planning to visit our California friend. If she picks up the Costco deal for herself and us, would we be able to use it if we are not the original purchaser or Costco members? There’s no residency restriction! What you’re describing would work perfectly fine! I am so disappointed that these are only offered in person. We have a trip planned for June with 6 of us for 3 days and this deal would save us over $700. I can’t take the gamble that they (and park reservations ) would be available when we land and I don’t know that I could trust sending someone over $2500 to get us some. Unfortunately we’ll just have to go through Disney and spend the extra $700 that could have helped elsewhere. Roberta, your Costco app has an option to search the inventory in your local warehouse. I would try that on all the Costco‘s within a 50 mile radius of you. It shouldn’t take longer than 10 minutes, and some posters below are saying they have seen the tickets in non-West Coast Costco‘s. I found these at Costco in Boise so at least some Idaho stores are also included. I think it’s really important to highlight the non-consecutive restriction more. I asked a friend in CA to buy for me and luckily I caught it before he bought because I’d have to add an extra night onto my trip to make it work and other people with short trips might not realize. From the way I read it, nonconsecutive is an option, rather than a restriction. That is, it says you “may” use it on nonconsecutive days (and spread them out however works for you). It doesn’t say “must” be used on nonconsecutive days, meaning you have no other option. Ah I think you’re right Lori. Thanks for catching that for me!! This is such a great deal! Hoping they are still available when I can get up to Oregon to buy one. Question: Can these be upgraded to a 4 day, 5 day, etc.? I’ve upgraded before when buying tickets from Get Away Today or others, and it’s never been a problem. I’d love to take advantage of the 4 day Anniversary deal, but we’re not going until the first week of December! (Thanks for the rec on that one Tom, looking forward to the cooler weather and low crowds!) This is an ABSURDLY good deal. Hope Costco doesn’t run out before we can get over there!! No weekend blackouts? Includes LLMP? Comes with a random $30 gift card? Valid from MAY TO DECEMBER?! The only possible downside is reservation availability, but as long as you book in advance ur chilling. It really is! Our parents don’t necessarily “need” Park Hoppers or LLMP when they come out to visit, but we’re still debating getting this over the current ticket deal for them. The big thing for us is the December expiration–visiting once this summer, once in October, and once in early December would be fantastic. I just purchased tickets for DL for this June and was shocked at this price savings, $300 less than what I just paid, but then didn’t feel quite as bad when I read the details. What a fantastic deal if you happen to live in CA! Wow. This is an amazing deal. I wish they’d make it available across the country because this is about $10 less than I paid for a 2-day Park Hopper with Lightning Lane Multi Pass ticket through Get Away Today for a trip in March and that obviously didn’t include the dining credit. One element that made last summer’s deal so much better was that it also included kid’s prices equivalent to the 50% off tickets offered in the Winter off-season. That made it easily the best publicly available deal in recent memory. This deal is definitely aggressive and I appreciate it. I don’t think we’re going to get a trip in this year, but if deals keep being this good it’s at least a little more likely. Thanks Tom!!!

Title: Bargain butter brings in the crowds

Bicerra By Susan Edmunds and Louise Ternouth of RNZ It was organised chaos this week at Costco when another delivery of butter arrived. This butter is not just any butter - while the other supermarkets are selling a 500g slab for up to $10, Costco's butter is $9.99 for a kilogram. Jody Middleton was among the crowd waiting to stock up on Monday. "I have to say most people were pretty polite about it," she said. "We all knew what we were there for, Costco staff came out and had a chat before they even opened the door, answering questions." She said it was worthwhile braving the crowds. She buys 12 boxes of butter to last her bakery a week. If she bought her butter elsewhere it would have cost more than $800 more. "Compared to Woolworths, it's a saving of $838 for my business in a week." Butter prices have increased significantly over the past year. Stats NZ data showed last week that butter prices were up 65.3 percent in the 12 months to April. Costco butter gets snapped up almost as soon as it arrives on the shelves, and one Taranaki man is making the 750km return trip to get it. Kaleb Halverson decided to start making the trip from New Plymouth to Auckland to deliver Costco's 1kg blocks of butter at $9.99 to customers across the Taranaki region. He only had a few orders at first, but they kept rolling in. 'Butter Boy' Kaleb Halverson loads up on the 1kg blocks on his round trips to Costco in Auckland. Photo: Supplied Halverson makes the trip every few weeks, with the next trip set for May 29, and he told Checkpoint the idea started out as an idea from his mum. "After she made a trip up [to Costco] herself and came back and just thought why not get groceries from there and bring them back for everyone else." He brings back everything the store has to offer, but said butter is definitely top of the list. "It's our hot item at the moment every order has butter." Other popular products are cleaning products and snacks. At the moment he is just servicing the Taranaki region with orders made through his website. Halverson does the orders on top of his full-time job, so the 10-hour round trip is done all on a day off. "We wake up at 4am, pack the car with a bunch of chilly bins, drive up four and a-half hours. "We go and we buy what people have ordered, spend quite a few hours in Costco looking for everything, pack the car and just head back." While he has only done a few trips so far, on the last one he brought back 160 blocks of butter, storing it in chilly bins and chilly bags. Now renting a van, Kaleb said they can do 300 blocks with a limit of 15 blocks per customer and a fee of $2 a block which makes it $12 a kg. He said they were losing out on money on their last trip, so they had upped the service fee from $10 to $40 to cover the cost of petrol and van hire. Halverson told Checkpoint it was still economical for customers to beat the rising cost of supermarket groceries. "It seems to be worth it for people because we've got quite a few orders. "It's unaffordable at the moment just everything here." Kaleb said he would likely have to leave even earlier for his next trip to Costco, as customers were queueing to get their hands on the $9.99 1kg block before the store even opened. Rob Hamlin, a senior lecturer at Otago University, said it was not a price that any retailer supplied by Fonterra could match. Photo: Supplied/John Paul R. Bicerra "The price charged by Costco for packed and processed New Zealand butter at retail is only marginally more than the current price being achieved by Fonterra at auction for its unprocessed milk solids as a bulk unprocessed export commodity." The butter is supplied by Westland Milk Products, which is owned by Yili Group. He said butter was either a "whopping" loss leader for Costco or Yili was trying to undercut the market. Costco declined a request for comment and Westland did not respond. Retail consultant Chris Wilkinson of First Retail Group said Costco knew it had to have a pricing advantage to maintain its value proposition for shoppers. "So achieve that through a pack size that no other retailer offers, and by making a little margin off a lot of volume. "Also, as a global retailer they will be one of the world's largest purchasers of dairy product which will afford them better deals than any Australasian retailer could hope for. They are trading on the world market." He said the pack size was probably not ideal for many households. "And the fact that you still have to spend your $70 to get your membership each year… all these things need to be considered." Chris Schulz, a senior investigative journalist at Consumer NZ, said it looked likely that the Costco butter was a loss leader. "The retailer's Facebook page is flooded with people speculating when the butter might be back on shelves, debating when to visit, and showing off when they do get it. "With butter costing at least $17 per kilo elsewhere else, Costco's pricing makes them look like the 'good guys' in contrast to our supermarket duopoly. Once they're in store, I'm sure many people are picking up roast chickens, cheese, and giant tubs of biscuits too." Fonterra said it could not comment on the pricing models of other retailers and consistent rises in global dairy commodity prices, could lead to an increase in the wholesale price of products like butter and cheese. "We are committed to keeping prices as low as possible, but they may sometimes need to be adjusted to reflect the increased costs." SUBSCRIBER SUBSCRIBER SUBSCRIBER SUBSCRIBER SUBSCRIBER SUBSCRIBER

Title: The 6 Groceries Smart Meal Planners Always Buy in Bulk

Our expert, award-winning staff selects the products we cover and rigorously researches and tests our top picks. If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Reviews ethics statement We asked experts about the best foods to stock up on to save money and trips to the supermarket. We spoke with a meal planning expert to find out which foods are smartest to buy in bulk. Grocery prices continue to be a major concern for many Americans. A recent survey by CNET confirms that rising food costs remain the top source of sticker shock—and I can relate. Over time, we've explored various strategies to stretch your grocery budget, from using food-saving apps like Flashfood, to comparing name brands versus store brands, and even asking whether shopping at Trader Joe's really saves money. Another tried-and-true strategy? Buying in bulk. Stocking up on everyday staples at warehouse stores like Costco can lead to significant savings. In fact, after crunching the numbers, I found that the average person could potentially save around $1,000 a year by buying in bulk. But bulk shopping isn't always simple. You'll need to think about storage space, shelf life and whether you'll actually use what you buy. As Mary Ann Kelley, the meal planning expert behind AddSaltandServe, puts it: "Shoppers can ask themselves three questions: A great deal isn't a deal if you end up throwing half of it away. Read more: Here's What an Expert Told Me About Food Expiration Dates Accepting that bulk shopping is generally a financially savvy move, and given the considerations posed above, I asked a few shopping and meal prepping experts what the best foods are to buy in bulk. Here they are: Beans are packed with protein and they're the perfect candidates to buy in bulk. "Canned beans are a pantry staple and a smart bulk purchase, thanks to their long shelf life and affordability at warehouse stores," says Kristen Markel, the bulk shopping expert behind Warehouse Wanderer. Beans also are incredibly versatile for food prep, as they can fit into just about any meal, including dessert. (Black bean brownies are worth your time.) Plus they have real staying power. "Properly stored in a cool, dark place, canned beans can last up to five years," says Markel. An eight-pack of canned beans at Costco retails for about $8, bringing the cost per can to under a dollar, and the cost per serving to about 30 cents. If you've got the time and wherewithal for dried beans, the savings are even bigger. A 10-pound bag of black beans costs around $18, for a cost per serving of less than 25 cents. If freezer space allows, fish is far more affordable when you buy in bulk. Meat and seafood in the freezer section are often frozen right after harvesting, so they can still be very high in quality. You can also process proteins bought fresh and freeze them yourself, and either way certain types of meat and seafood can stay in your freezer for up to a year. (This FoodKeeper app from the US Department of Health and Human Services is a handy guide to how long you can store various foods.) "Shoppers can often find bulk-packaged fresh and frozen meat at a better price, or they may stock up on bulk amounts of normal packages of meat when they are on sale," says Kelley. It's possible to have a bulk shopping mindset even if you don't have access to a traditional bulk store. "Meat bought in bulk at a good price can be frozen as is, but shoppers can also save space -- and make dinner prep less stressful -- by cooking meats ahead that will be used later in cooked form in recipes. For instance, shoppers can cook bulk packages of ground beef or chicken when they bring them home, and then they can use the cooked meat for recipes like tacos, chili, and chicken soup." Butter is more shelf-stable than most people think, making it a good candidate for buying in bulk. We typically think primarily of the pantry or freezer when it comes to buying in bulk, but "don't overlook dairy, especially butter," says Markel. "Butter freezes beautifully and can last up to a year in the freezer." Costco's Kirkland Signature butter is considered one of its most economical offerings among fans, around $18 (in my region) for 4 pounds, which doesn't come with an overwhelming space requirement in the freezer. At my nearest grocery store, the same amount of butter costs twice that much. Boxed pasta lasts for up to two years. Boxed pasta may require some storage space, but if you're able to bulk up on it, it has the longevity to make it worthwhile. "Dry pasta is another bulk-buy winner, with an unopened shelf life of up to two years," says Markel. "For even longer storage, consider vacuum-sealing pasta to maintain freshness well beyond its typical expiration." (Here are the best vacuum sealers we've tested.) Eight pounds of Barilla penne cost $13 at Costco, which results in a savings of over a dollar per pound compared with buying individual boxes at my local supermarket. Italian American families, or carb lovers, take note. Not all spices are good to buy in bulk, but whole peppercorns keep their pep for a while. Items with the highest prices per ounce can be prime candidates for bulk shopping, on a case-by-case basis depending on longevity. "Specialty items that cost significantly less on sale can be worth buying in bulk, but only if they will be used," says Kelley. "A good example of this is expensive spices that might be used frequently, like quality black peppercorns," she says. Other specialty items that can be pricey but can be stockpiled when they're on sale include saffron, tinned fish and even caviar -- which can actually be frozen when unopened and kept for up to a year. If you want to get the most bang for your buck, buy paper towels and other household products in bulk. So long as you're bulk shopping, here's a bonus nonfood item. "Paper products are among the items that are less expensive to buy in bulk packaging, especially toilet paper and paper towels," says Kelley." "Since paper products do not need to be stored in a climate controlled area, utility spaces, attics and other unfinished spaces are fine for storage, making it easier to make room for them." If you have a paper towel dependency, as I do, consider a 12-pack of Kirkland paper towels for $23, versus single rolls that can be as much as $3 and up.
