Title: Spain’s Olive Oil Prices Fall Over 50%: Good News for Shoppers, Bad for Farmers

Posted on 02/12/2025 5:10:13 PM PST by nickcarraway Spain, the world’s largest producer of olive oil, has seen a significant drop in prices, with costs falling by 55 per cent in the past year, according to The Spanish Ministry of Agriculture. While this is welcome news for olive oil consumers, the sharp decline raises concerns for olive oil producers who rely on stable pricing to sustain their businesses. Why are olive oil prices falling in Spain again? The price drop comes after two years of record highs due to extreme droughts that severely impacted harvests. However, a wetter winter and a return to normal temperatures last spring have resulted in higher-than-average olive oil production, according to the International Olive Oil Council (IOC). Spain’s olive oil output is expected to reach 1.4 million tonnes this season, a significant increase from 850,000 tonnes last year. The Spanish Ministry of Agriculture has reported that since September 2024, olive oil producer prices have fallen consistently. As of late January 2025, 100 kilograms of olive oil cost €381.89, marking a 44.9 per cent decrease since the start of the season and a 54.7 per cent drop compared to the same period last year. Olive oil farmers and producers Despite the relief for consumers, the price collapse is putting significant pressure on farmers and producers. Many small and medium-sized producers, particularly in Andalucía, where the majority of Spain’s olive oil is produced, are struggling to cover costs. If prices continue to fall, some farmers may be forced to cut production or leave the industry altogether. Walter Zanre, UK managing director of the renowned Filippo Berio brand, stated: “We were really struggling to source quality olive oil last year. Now that the new season oils have arrived, prices have fallen significantly.” Full reduction of wholesale olive oil prices does not reach supermarket shoppers Although producer prices have dropped dramatically, supermarket prices have not fallen at the same rate, funny that. According to consumer organisation FACUA, while wholesale prices have more than halved, retail prices have only decreased by 24 per cent in the past year. A one-litre bottle of olive oil, which cost €12.88 last year, now averages €9.79 – a €3.09 reduction. Meanwhile, at the production level, the price per litre has dropped by over €4, according to a report by In Spain News. Experts say this is because supermarkets are still selling older stock bought at higher prices. Consumers should expect further price reductions in the coming months as new supplies enter the market – rejoice! While the current trend suggests more affordable olive oil in the near future, the industry remains vulnerable to climate conditions and global market fluctuations. The IOC predicts that better harvests across Spain, Greece, Portugal, and Tunisia will help stabilise supply, but producers warn that prolonged low prices could threaten the long-term sustainability of the industry.

According to consumer organisation FACUA, while wholesale prices have more than halved, retail prices have only decreased by 24 per cent in the past year. A one-litre bottle of olive oil, which cost €12.88 last year, now averages €9.79 – a €3.09 reduction. Meanwhile, at the production level, the price per litre has dropped by over €4, according to a report by In Spain News. Experts say this is because supermarkets are still selling older stock bought at higher prices. Consumers should expect further price reductions in the coming months as new supplies enter the market – rejoice! While the current trend suggests more affordable olive oil in the near future, the industry remains vulnerable to climate conditions and global market fluctuations. The IOC predicts that better harvests across Spain, Greece, Portugal, and Tunisia will help stabilise supply, but producers warn that prolonged low prices could threaten the long-term sustainability of the industry.

According to consumer organisation FACUA, while wholesale prices have more than halved, retail prices have only decreased by 24 per cent in the past year. A one-litre bottle of olive oil, which cost €12.88 last year, now averages €9.79 – a €3.09 reduction. Meanwhile, at the production level, the price per litre has dropped by over €4, according to a report by In Spain News. Experts say this is because supermarkets are still selling older stock bought at higher prices. Consumers should expect further price reductions in the coming months as new supplies enter the market – rejoice! While the current trend suggests more affordable olive oil in the near future, the industry remains vulnerable to climate conditions and global market fluctuations. The IOC predicts that better harvests across Spain, Greece, Portugal, and Tunisia will help stabilise supply, but producers warn that prolonged low prices could threaten the long-term sustainability of the industry.

Title: LEDs, OLEDs, and Micro LEDs

Full Content:
The oldest and most basic form of a flat screen television is the LCD, or Liquid Crystal Display. A layer of liquid crystals is sandwiched between two layers of polarizing filters. When an electric signal is applied to those filters (that signal being the source to be displayed) the liquid crystals align in changing patterns to produce the moving and (where needed) color image. The full details on how this many-layered LCD panel performs these tasks are more complex than this brief description can convey without reams of diagrams. Eye-watering descriptions of the entire process are readily available on YouTube. But suffice it to say here that the actual moving and full color image is produced by this LCD panel. But the LCD panel itself doesn't have the ability to illuminate, so some form of backlighting is needed to produce a viewable image. In the earliest LCD TVs that backlighting was produced by cold cathode fluorescent lamps (CCFLs) positioned behind the LCD imaging panel. But those lowly LCD displays were soon improved by using LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes) for the needed backlighting. This improved on some aspects of the overall performance, but the stationary LED backlighting still didn't contribute anything to the party other than the somewhat important chore of making the moving images in the LCD panel visible! Consumers flocked to those early LED TVs for their relative ease of installation compared to the dominant CRT TVs of the day. But there were issues remaining and competition soon drove TV makers to improve the performance of their LED TVs. Two developments, in particular, made their way into the LED TV market: local dimming and quantum dots. The LED backlighting on an LED TV consists of a large number of LEDs uniformly spread out across the backlight panel. But in early LED TVs the illumination of this LED backlighting was fixed at maximum to offer bright, punchy images. Any reduction of that light level, as required by the source, was the job of the LCD imaging panel sitting in front of the unchanging backlight. But there's always at least some light leakage through the LCD panel. The result was compromised contrast and mediocre black levels seen by the viewer. But suppose we divide those backlight LEDs into multiple zones and process each of these zones separately, as needed, to respond instantly to the changing brightness requirements of the source. Yes, the LCD still produces the detailed image, but by adding variable illumination from the now active LED backlighting zones we can significantly improve an LED TV's overall contrast and black level. That, in effect, is local dimming. It's now widely used in LED TVs of any distinction. But not all local dimming implementations are equally effective. The more dimming zones the better, but this will affect the price of the set. Nevertheless, even a modest application of local dimming can dramatically improve the contrast and black levels on an LED TV. Another key advancement in many of today's LED TVs is the use of quantum dots. A quantum dot is a microscopic particle that glows either red or green (depending on its size) when it's hit by blue light. In a conventional LED TV, backlit by white light, the white must first be filtered to extract the red, green, and blue colors needed to generate full-color images. But with a blue backlight, assisted by the red and green light produced by the quantum dots, separate color filtration is unneeded. This offers the added benefit of a deeper, wider, and more accurate range of color. Effectively controlling all of these performance benefits to work together demands sophisticated micro processing. All of today's TVs employ such microprocessors, often with creative and fanciful names. These names might even include the tech catchphrase of the decade: AI! But don't get too excited; no HDTV we know of can yet ascertain the program you planned to watch and switch to it even before you can grab the remote control! Manufacturers have also generated a blizzard of names for what are, essentially, LED TVs. But there's another type of TV design that's genuinely different. It's OLED, or Organic Light Emitting Diodes. The fundamental difference here from an LED TV is that OLEDs are self-illuminating. They don't require a backlight. Since each OLED can shut down completely where needed, OLEDs typically offer black levels and contrast superior to those achievable by any other widely available type of display. That's not to say that the best locally dimmed LED TVs can't come remarkably close. With careful setup they can. I've been living daily with the 85-inch TCL LED TV I reviewed last year and have had few complaints (though the impact of sheer screen size can also overwhelm minor reservations!). But once you've viewed the most challenging, near-black images on a good OLED TV, in a dim or near-darkened room, the experience is hard to forget. The image on an LED TV begins fading when viewed at off-center angles starting at roughly 25-30 degrees. Viewers seated beyond that are unlikely to miss the loss of contrast. Some LED TVs are better at this than others, but none in my experience will fully challenge an OLED's "choose any seat" flexibility. With these advantages, why would anyone choose an LED TV? The answers involve cost, peak brightness, something called burn-in, and range of available offerings. OLED TVs tend to be pricier than high-end LED designs in equivalent screen sizes. LED TVs generally offer higher peak brightness levels, which can be significant if you plan to do most of your viewing in a brightly lit room. And even if not, program sources produced in high dynamic range might also offer more pop on an LED TV than on an OLED. If you watch a lot of such HDR material you might be happier with an LED TV. Leaving a bright, stationary image on an LED TV for hours will affect little more than your electric bill. But on an OLED it might well leave a ghostly trace of that image on the screen. This might fade out over time depending on how bright the image was and how long it was left on the screen. If it's temporary, this is called image retention. But if it's permanent, it's true burn-in. To be fair, burn-in can be avoided with a little extra care. It's never an issue with fully moving images, and today's OLEDs claim to be a little less prone to it than were earlier OLED designs. But even so, the fixed scoreboards common to video games and sports can be potential burn-in risks. And if you live in a busy household with the TV on for hours every day, and other users who might be less careful than you, a good LED-TV might be your best choice. It's also true that a wider selection of LED TVs is available at wider price points than OLED offerings. And not all manufacturers offer OLEDs. In the US, Sony, LG, Panasonic and Samsung do (at least as of this writing) but TCL and Hisense do not. But there's also yet another new television format you may have heard of. It's called Micro LED. In a Micro LED TV the active LEDs that produce the picture are so small that they're the size of a pixel. In other words, a Micro LED TV can produce the image directly. But don't get too excited just yet. Manufacturers working on this type of display can't yet make individual Micro LEDs small enough to function directly as pixels in popular TV sizes. As a result, such TVs are, so far, available only in jumbo sizes, at truly eye-watering prices, and likely only at very specialized dealers or direct from the factory. Samsung can sell you a 114-inch model for around $150,000 (that's not a typo!), though they were out of stock when I checked! For now, if the friendly salesperson at your local Best Buy or Costco claims that the TV you're looking at is a micro LED, it almost certainly is not and that salesperson is likely just confused. If and when they can make the pixel-sized LEDs small enough for popular sizes and at prices comparable to today's TVs, that could upset the whole television landscape. But don't expect to see them anytime soon. The full details on how this many-layered LCD panel performs these tasks are more complex than this brief description can convey without reams of diagrams. Eye-watering descriptions of the entire process are readily available on YouTube. But suffice it to say here that the actual moving and full color image is produced by this LCD panel. But the LCD panel itself doesn't have the ability to illuminate, so some form of backlighting is needed to produce a viewable image. In the earliest LCD TVs that backlighting was produced by cold cathode fluorescent lamps (CCFLs) positioned behind the LCD imaging panel. But those lowly LCD displays were soon improved by using LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes) for the needed backlighting. This improved on some aspects of the overall performance, but the stationary LED backlighting still didn't contribute anything to the party other than the somewhat important chore of making the moving images in the LCD panel visible! Consumers flocked to those early LED TVs for their relative ease of installation compared to the dominant CRT TVs of the day. But there were issues remaining and competition soon drove TV makers to improve the performance of their LED TVs.

That, in effect, is local dimming. It's now widely used in LED TVs of any distinction. But not all local dimming implementations are equally effective. The more dimming zones the better, but this will affect the price of the set. Nevertheless, even a modest application of local dimming can dramatically improve the contrast and black levels on an LED TV. Another key advancement in many of today's LED TVs is the use of quantum dots. A quantum dot is a microscopic particle that glows either red or green (depending on its size) when it's hit by blue light. In a conventional LED TV, backlit by white light, the white must first be filtered to extract the red, green, and blue colors needed to generate full-color images. But with a blue backlight, assisted by the red and green light produced by the quantum dots, separate color filtration is unneeded. This offers the added benefit of a deeper, wider, and more accurate range of color. Effectively controlling all of these performance benefits to work together demands sophisticated micro processing. All of today's TVs employ such microprocessors, often with creative and fanciful names. These names might even include the tech catchphrase of the decade: AI! But don't get too excited; no HDTV we know of can yet ascertain the program you planned to watch and switch to it even before you can grab the remote control! Manufacturers have also generated a blizzard of names for what are, essentially, LED TVs. But there's another type of TV design that's genuinely different. It's OLED, or Organic Light Emitting Diodes. The fundamental difference here from an LED TV is that OLEDs are self-illuminating. They don't require a backlight. Since each OLED can shut down completely where needed, OLEDs typically offer black levels and contrast superior to those achievable by any other widely available type of display. That's not to say that the best locally dimmed LED TVs can't come remarkably close. With careful setup they can. I've been living daily with the 85-inch TCL LED TV I reviewed last year and have had few complaints (though the impact of sheer screen size can also overwhelm minor reservations!). But once you've viewed the most challenging, near-black images on a good OLED TV, in a dim or near-darkened room, the experience is hard to forget. The image on an LED TV begins fading when viewed at off-center angles starting at roughly 25-30 degrees. Viewers seated beyond that are unlikely to miss the loss of contrast. Some LED TVs are better at this than others, but none in my experience will fully challenge an OLED's "choose any seat" flexibility. With these advantages, why would anyone choose an LED TV? The answers involve cost, peak brightness, something called burn-in, and range of available offerings. OLED TVs tend to be pricier than high-end LED designs in equivalent screen sizes. LED TVs generally offer higher peak brightness levels, which can be significant if you plan to do most of your viewing in a brightly lit room. And even if not, program sources produced in high dynamic range might also offer more pop on an LED TV than on an OLED. If you watch a lot of such HDR material you might be happier with an LED TV. Leaving a bright, stationary image on an LED TV for hours will affect little more than your electric bill. But on an OLED it might well leave a ghostly trace of that image on the screen. This might fade out over time depending on how bright the image was and how long it was left on the screen. If it's temporary, this is called image retention. But if it's permanent, it's true burn-in. To be fair, burn-in can be avoided with a little extra care. It's never an issue with fully moving images, and today's OLEDs claim to be a little less prone to it than were earlier OLED designs. But even so, the fixed scoreboards common to video games and sports can be potential burn-in risks. And if you live in a busy household with the TV on for hours every day, and other users who might be less careful than you, a good LED-TV might be your best choice. It's also true that a wider selection of LED TVs is available at wider price points than OLED offerings. And not all manufacturers offer OLEDs. In the US, Sony, LG, Panasonic and Samsung do (at least as of this writing) but TCL and Hisense do not. But there's also yet another new television format you may have heard of. It's called Micro LED. In a Micro LED TV the active LEDs that produce the picture are so small that they're the size of a pixel. In other words, a Micro LED TV can produce the image directly. But don't get too excited just yet. Manufacturers working on this type of display can't yet make individual Micro LEDs small enough to function directly as pixels in popular TV sizes. As a result, such TVs are, so far, available only in jumbo sizes, at truly eye-watering prices, and likely only at very specialized dealers or direct from the factory. Samsung can sell you a 114-inch model for around $150,000 (that's not a typo!), though they were out of stock when I checked! For now, if the friendly salesperson at your local Best Buy or Costco claims that the TV you're looking at is a micro LED, it almost certainly is not and that salesperson is likely just confused. If and when they can make the pixel-sized LEDs small enough for popular sizes and at prices comparable to today's TVs, that could upset the whole television landscape.

And even if not, program sources produced in high dynamic range might also offer more pop on an LED TV than on an OLED. If you watch a lot of such HDR material you might be happier with an LED TV. Leaving a bright, stationary image on an LED TV for hours will affect little more than your electric bill. But on an OLED it might well leave a ghostly trace of that image on the screen. This might fade out over time depending on how bright the image was and how long it was left on the screen. If it's temporary, this is called image retention. But if it's permanent, it's true burn-in. To be fair, burn-in can be avoided with a little extra care. It's never an issue with fully moving images, and today's OLEDs claim to be a little less prone to it than were earlier OLED designs. But even so, the fixed scoreboards common to video games and sports can be potential burn-in risks. And if you live in a busy household with the TV on for hours every day, and other users who might be less careful than you, a good LED-TV might be your best choice. It's also true that a wider selection of LED TVs is available at wider price points than OLED offerings. And not all manufacturers offer OLEDs. In the US, Sony, LG, Panasonic and Samsung do (at least as of this writing) but TCL and Hisense do not. But there's also yet another new television format you may have heard of. It's called Micro LED. In a Micro LED TV the active LEDs that produce the picture are so small that they're the size of a pixel. In other words, a Micro LED TV can produce the image directly. But don't get too excited just yet. Manufacturers working on this type of display can't yet make individual Micro LEDs small enough to function directly as pixels in popular TV sizes. As a result, such TVs are, so far, available only in jumbo sizes, at truly eye-watering prices, and likely only at very specialized dealers or direct from the factory. Samsung can sell you a 114-inch model for around $150,000 (that's not a typo!), though they were out of stock when I checked! For now, if the friendly salesperson at your local Best Buy or Costco claims that the TV you're looking at is a micro LED, it almost certainly is not and that salesperson is likely just confused. If and when they can make the pixel-sized LEDs small enough for popular sizes and at prices comparable to today's TVs, that could upset the whole television landscape. But don't expect to see them anytime soon. With these advantages, why would anyone choose an LED TV?

Title: Egg prices shot up 15% in January as retailers limit customer purchases

Watch CBS News By Megan Cerullo, Kate Gibson Edited By Alain Sherter Updated on: February 13, 2025 / 7:27 AM EST / CBS News Egg prices continue to soar — if shoppers can even find them in grocery stores. In January alone, the cost of eggs around the U.S. jumped more than 15% from a year ago, to roughly $4.95 a dozen. That's five times the overall U.S. inflation rate of 3%, Consumer Price Index data showed on Wednesday. In 2019, consumers could pick up a dozen eggs for around $1.54, but by last year the price had soared to $4.15 — a 170% increase, according to CBS News' price tracker of everyday goods. The spike in egg prices last month underscores the devastating impact of avian flu, which killed more than 40 million egg-laying birds last year. Including ducks and chickens, 148 million birds have been ordered euthanized since the current strain of bird flu, H5N1, began spreading around the U.S. in 2022. If there's any good news, it's that egg prices are at least expected to rise more slowly over the course of the year. The January surge "is likely a one-off," said EY Chief Economist Gregory Daco. But that may come as small consolation for the millions of consumers who continue to grapple with higher food costs both at home and in restaurants due to record-high egg prices. The price spike in eggs is largely driven by the bird flu, which continues to hit farms and wipe out flocks. When demand remains steady for a product that isn't easily substituted and supply diminishes, prices tend to rise. "If you don't have a bird you don't have an egg," Sharon Linsenbardt, founder and owner of Barn Buddies Rescue and Sanctuary in Las Vegas, told CBS News reporter Andres Gutierrez. The millions of egg-laying hens killed by avian influenza can't be replaced easily and quickly, added Linsenhardt, who has limited sales to two dozen eggs a family. "High egg prices are due to the avian flu issue, which cuts the supply in the available eggs for sale," Columbia Business School professor Yiming Ma told CBS MoneyWatch. "If you have less supply, that drives up the prices." Egg supplies are likely to remain constrained as long as bird flu outbreaks continue, according to David Anderson, an agricultural economics professor at Texas A&M University. Anderson, noting a cultural shift that may be exacerbating the problem, also said he has noticed that Americans are leaning toward more protein-heavy diets, driving demand for eggs. "We have this nutritional trend, and as people incorporate more protein in their diets, that increases overall egg demand and sets a higher base for demand," he said. "Then when we get this supply shock, low and behold, we get higher prices." Ongoing egg shortages and rising prices recently prompted 24-hour breakfast chain Waffle House to add a 50 cent surcharge per egg, while some major grocery chains are imposing limits on how many eggs shoppers can buy at a time. Walmart is curtailing purchases of 60-count cartons to two per purchase "to ensure more customers can have access to eggs," a spokesperson for the retailer said. "Although supply is very tight, we're working with suppliers to try and help meet customer demand, while striving to keep prices as low as possible," the spokesperson added. At Sam's Club, a division of Walmart, the warehouse club is limiting the number of egg purchases to two per item at its nearly 600 stores across the U.S. As of Wednesday, most of Target's nearly 2,000 U.S. stores had eggs in stock, and the retailer only has purchase limits in place in its Hawaii stores, according to a spokesperson for the retailer. "We'll continue to monitor and adjust as needed," they added. Kroger, which operates about 2,700 U.S. grocery stores, hasn't imposed a company-wide cap on egg purchases, though some stores are limiting customers to buying two dozen per visit. Giant Eagle said it was selling conventional shelled eggs "at or below our cost across all our supermarkets" to limit the impact of rising egg prices on its customers. The regional grocery, which operates more than 470 stores in Indiana, Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia, is encouraging shoppers to limit their purchase to a maximum of three egg cartons per visit. Amazon-owned Whole Foods and Costco did not respond to requests for comment. Egg prices are expected to rise a total of 20% in 2025, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Despite the rising costs, consumer demand remains firm and could even increase as Easter approaches, offering little hope for respite on prices. Two things have to happen for prices to ease, according to experts. The U.S. must contain the bird flu, and older chickens that are past their productive primes, as well as diseased chickens, have to be replaced. Exactly how long all of this will take is uncertain. "it's not clear that we've fully controlled the spread of bird flu. That's the first step, and it'll be a few months after that before you can breed and replace the laying population," Bryan Spillane, Bank of America senior food and beverage analyst, told CBS MoneyWatch. He expects it will be at least another three to six months before prices moderate. If restaurants continue to implement surcharges for eggs, that could eventually put a damper on demand. In the near-term, Anderson expects eggs to continue hitting consumers' wallets. "I wouldn't be surprised to see prices continue to go up, because we continue to have outbreaks," he said. Cost-conscious consumers can comparison shop among grocery stores, noted NerdWallet spokesperson Sara Rathner, but be aware that if price differences aren't substantial, you could eat up any cost savings on gas. Other ways to save on eggs include using store circulars, or buying them with a cash-back credit card. "Then you're combining multiple ways to reduce your bill," she said.

Title: How Will Tariffs Impact You? Here’s What To Know About Trump’s Plans

From reciprocal tariffs to a focus on Mexico and Canada, economist forecasts and recent history both indicate that Trump’s trade policies will increase prices for American consumers. Here’s how. Consumers will start feeling the impacts of President Donald Trump’s tariffs soon. Trump this week started the process of implementing “reciprocal tariffs,” a 10% levy is in effect on goods from China, and while his 25% import taxes on Mexico and Canada were delayed until next month, they would also have sweeping economic impacts. Many Americans are left wondering: Who pays the price? Here’s a rundown on the history and impacts of recent tariffs, Trump’s proposals and what to expect when it comes to increased costs. And there will be impacts: Nearly all economists agree tariffs are a tax on consumers. If you’re wondering how to prepare for the financial implications, we’ve got you covered on that, too. Workers assemble washing machines on the production line at a Haier factory in Qingdao in east China's Shandong province. To see the direct impact of tariffs on prices, look no further than washing machines. In 2018, President Donald Trump enacted tariffs ranging from 20% to 50% on imported washing machines. His administration purported that the tariffs would protect American industry—and such a move did add around 1,800 jobs domestically, according to a study in the American Economic Review. But each of those jobs came with an average annual cost to consumers of over $815,000. That’s because the report found that the tariffs raised the price of washing machines and dryers (which were not subject to such a tax, but are usually bundled with washers) by about $86 and $92 per unit, respectively. In total, the tariffs cost consumers just over $1.5 billion annually. And it wasn’t just the foreign producers who upped prices: Domestic manufacturers like Whirlpool and Maytag raised their prices by nearly the same amount once their competitors were charging more, says Felix Tintelnot, associate professor of economics at Duke University and one of the study’s authors. And he said the price of dryers went up alongside washers to likely spread out the additional cost producers were facing. Tintelnot said while tariffs can increase the number of jobs in specific sectors, they won’t affect aggregate employment because the country is already near full employment (unemployment is at 4%). “You can get [a] reallocation of employment towards industries that faced higher imports before, but that’s going to come at the loss of employment in other industries, especially export intensive industries,” he tells Forbes. “We are basically trading off cost to consumers with the benefits for producers in the import competing sectors.” Anti-World Trade Organization protesters during a 1999 demonstration in Seattle. Tariffs have been a trade weapon in the United States’ arsenal since the country’s very beginning. One of Congress’ first acts was to pass the Tariff Act of 1789, which was aimed at protecting domestic industry and raising revenue for the new government. In fact, tariffs actually constituted the majority of the federal government’s revenue until the creation of the income tax in 1913. With more money flowing into the government’s coffers from the income tax, along with the spoils of major industrial expansion in the late 1800s, import duties became less critical. Still, after the stock market crashed in 1929, Congress approved the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, which raised already high tariff rates and angered the country’s trading partners. Trade between Europe and the U.S. fell by two-thirds, worsening the Great Depression. Some experts also say it helped give rise to extremist ideologies in Europe. But after World War II, the world rejected “protectionist” trade policies like tariffs, and 23 countries signed onto the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in 1947, which later became part of the World Trade Organization. And we remained in that era of free trade for decades, amid rising globalization and corporations “offshoring” manufacturing to lower-cost countries like China. U.S. manufacturing employment peaked in 1979 at 19.6 million, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, but by 2019, that had fallen to 12.8 million, a 35% drop. Americans’ anxieties over the loss of such blue-collar jobs had been brewing long before Donald Trump, as the manufacturing sector was particularly hard hit by the 2008 Great Recession. Enter Trump, who tapped into those frustrations with an “America First” pitch. LUIS TATO/AFP via Getty Images Trump used tariffs as a tool in his first administration, targeting washing machines, solar panels and crucially, steel and aluminum, key materials in an already pricey housing market. Former President Joe Biden kept many of Trump’s tariffs in place. But Trump’s tariff threats this time around are more wide-ranging and potentially damaging, economists say. Though the president’s latest threats focused on Canada, Mexico and China, he has previously suggested taxing all goods manufactured abroad at 20%. That would almost certainly raise prices for consumers, especially since manufacturers wouldn’t be able to avoid a tariff by moving operations to a different country. Still, Vietnam is expected to be a major beneficiary of Trump’s China tariffs, and some companies already pivoted to the Southeast Asian country during the previous Trump Administration. Apple, for instance, started moving AirPods manufacturing from China to Vietnam in May 2020. “If previously it was made in China, now it’s going to be made in Vietnam,” Jason Miller, a professor of supply chain management at Michigan State University, told Forbes in November. “That production is not coming back to America.” ANDREJ IVANOV/AFP via Getty Images Trump’s China tariffs are expected to impact a wide variety of consumer goods, from electronics to toys and shoes. Around 80% of toys imported to the U.S. come from China, the Toy Association trade group told Forbes, and around 37% of all footwear imports—totaling $9.5 billion—to the U.S. in 2023 came from China, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission. And for millions of price-conscious shoppers who rely on low-cost Chinese retailers like Temu and Shein, the tariffs will also close a little-known loophole that allows merchandise under $800 to enter the U.S. without being taxed. Many electronic devices like iPhones are assembled in China, a core concern for Apple investors as its stock fell 3% the day before the tariffs went into effect. And despite his relationship with President Donald Trump, Elon Musk was the biggest, immediate loser amid the stock market’s tariff reaction early last week, as investors expect the tariffs to impact Tesla’s business and profitability. Though the tariffs on Canada and Mexico were delayed for 30 days, Trump indicated that they would be needed as recently as Sunday, and they have the potential to wreak havoc on a highly integrated North American supply chain. Consumers are already conscious about grocery prices, and the U.S. relies heavily on the two countries for fresh produce. Canada is the largest exporter of meat to the U.S. Natural gas and oil from Canada would be subject to a 10% levy, and oil traders and consumers would pay the price. The price of gas is likely to increase up to 40 cents a gallon within days of tariffs on Canada and Mexico, according to Patrick De Haan, GasBuddy’s head of petroleum analysis. Canada sends about 20% of the oil used by Americans. Tariffs on the two countries would also hit the auto industry hard, as companies like General Motors and Ford rely on Canadian and Mexican companies for parts. Experts estimate the average price of a new car will increase by $3,000, as 22% of all vehicles sold in the U.S. are imported from the two countries, per S&P Global. “The proposed tariffs on Canada and Mexico are really quite harmful and would change how American firms can do business,” says Tintelnot. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Separate from tariffs planned for Canadian and Mexican imports, Trump imposed a 25% global tariff on steel and aluminum imports Monday. But the European Union vowed to retaliate, and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese sought an exemption for his country. And Trump began the process Thursday of determining reciprocal tariffs, though they won’t take effect immediately. These tariffs are straightforward in theory: The U.S. would place the same levies on imported goods that a country imposes on what they import from the U.S. But it’s actually more complicated than that, because different types of goods are taxed differently. Trump’s memo Thursday directed his administration to conduct a country-by-country review to determine the tariffs. Companies are likely to respond to tariffs in several ways, explains Lori Yue, an associate professor at Columbia Business School. One is building up a supply chain in the U.S., which “doesn’t happen overnight,” or they may lobby the Trump Administration for exceptions. But ultimately, they’re likely to just pass on the cost, which economists expect to tamp down economic growth. “Some of the products, especially the agriculture, gasoline and also the automobile products, this affects people’s daily life,” Yue tells Forbes. “They’re going to feel it stronger than last time.” Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images TOPLINE While Donald Trump’s 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada are paused for now, investors should be prepared if that relief is only temporary. The tariffs on China still took effect this month, and Trump may be emboldened to continue using the threat of tariffs as an intimidation tactic. Adrian Helfert, CIO of alternative and multi-asset portfolios at Dallas-based Westwood, recommends finding protection in small- and mid-sized businesses that have a more domestic focus, which are still broadly undervalued relative to large caps. He has his eye on U.S. defense stocks like Kratos, a manufacturer of military electronics and drones, anticipating that defense spending will be mostly spared from Trump’s threatened cuts to the federal budget. Another area of the market Helfert is bullish on is regional banks like Texas-based Cullen/Frost Bankers, which will benefit from decreased regulatory costs and more M&A activity and don’t have a large international presence. One of Trump’s tariff goals in addition to stemming drug trafficking is to pressure other American businesses to bring more manufacturing back to the U.S. and trade more with American peers, which will help smaller companies who already have most of their footprints close to home. Nicholas Galluccio, who manages the Teton Westwood Small-Cap Equity Fund, points out that companies comprising the Morningstar small-cap value index already generate 70% of their revenue domestically and are trading at a 20% discount to large caps, while historically they’ve fetched a premium. For investors more inclined to invest in passive index funds, the Vanguard Small-Cap Value Index Fund ETF (VBR) could be an appropriate option for shelter from a potential trade war. WHY IT MATTERS “The stock market cheered Donald Trump’s return to office, rising to new records after he was elected in hopes that his victory would signal a new era of business-friendly deregulation, but it might not be that simple,” says Forbes staff writer Hank Tucker. “Even economic experts who supported him downplayed his threats of tariffs during the campaign, but now that it turns out he was serious about some of those promises, the stock market could suffer. Regardless of how investors feel about his politics, it’s important to be thinking about which businesses will be more sheltered from trade restrictions with China if tensions continue to escalate and prices rise.” MORE Trump Says Looming Oil Tariffs Are Negotiable: ‘Depends On What Their Price Is’ Trump’s tariff proposals would cost middle-class U.S. households $1,700 in increased taxes each year, as projected by the nonpartisan think tank Peterson Institute for International Economics. So how do you prepare? Consumers can try shopping at discount or bulk retailers like Costco or Sam’s Club, and for groceries, consider your local farmer’s market, though increased demand could drive up those prices, too. If you’re a small business owner, it’s probably a good time to refresh research on your supply chain, taking tariffs into account when considering pricing. Many U.S. automakers, set to be heavily impacted by tariffs, have operations in Canada just hours from a bridge connected to which American city? A. Cleveland B. Buffalo C. Detroit D.

Title: Bird flu creates short supply of eggs and prices keep rising

WESTCHESTER COUNTY, New York (WABC) -- Iris Katz arrived at the Trader Joe's in Hartsdale on Monday on a mission to buy some eggs. The mission failed. "Not even hard-boiled eggs," Katz said. "I'll try other places?" Even if she found the eggs, Trader Joe's now limits sales to one dozen per customer. "To ensure that as many of our customers who need eggs are able to purchase them when they visit Trader Joe's," said a company spokesperson. The short supply and the ever-present demand for eggs mean price hikes for consumers. According to the USDA, the average price of a dozen eggs is now $7.95, up from $3.30 this time last year. "I really noticed around December. The price was crazy. And normally, around the holiday times, it always goes down," shopper Dina Rose said. The egg shortage and resulting price hikes are the direct result of the highly contagious bird flu, which has decimated the number of egg-laying hens. Governor Kathy Hochul said inspectors recently detected bird flu at seven live poultry markets in Queens, the Bronx and Brooklyn. The governor has ordered two live markets in Westchester County to close, clean, and disinfect their premises. The same order applies to markets in Nassau and Suffolk counties, even though inspectors never detected bird flu at those locations. "It was $6.99 for a dozen, and I said forget about it. So my daughter buys at Costco, and she buys a bunch of them," shopper John Esposito said. We visited the Costco in Yonkers. They had eggs in stock at the cost of $8.49 for two dozen, but Costco also issued a limit of 3 cartons per customer. Analysts say stabilizing the egg supply centers on containing the bird flu outbreak and repopulating the number of egg-laying hens. They estimate that the process could take months. ---------- * Get Eyewitness News Delivered * Follow us on YouTube * More local news * Send us a news tip * Download the abc7NY app for breaking news alerts Have a breaking news tip or an idea for a story we should cover?

Since eggs have become the new measure of how our economy is doing, it’s worth noting our local Costco is completely out of them, which, if in stock, cost nearly twice as much as they did in December. (Note: It was never about the price of eggs… It’s about racism.)

Title: McDonald's earnings miss due to E. Coli outbreak and a decline in consumer spending

McDonald’s customers aren’t “lovin’ it.” The fast-food giant missed Wall Street’s expectations for the fourth quarter, largely due to the lingering effects of an E. coli outbreak and ongoing inflation pressures. The October incident sickened hundreds of customers and caused a massive drop in foot traffic, leading to a decline in same-store sales. In early trading, McDonald’s shares were slightly up. “Our fourth-quarter performance reflects the impact of the food incident,” CEO Chris Kempczinski said during the company’s Feb. 10 earnings call. The Illinois-based company reported revenue of $6.39 billion, missing Wall Street’s forecast of $6.44 billion in revenue, while earnings per share came in at $2.80 — meeting expectations. Additionally, U.S. same-store sales fell 1.4% year-over-year, surpassing the Street’s modest projection of 0.6%. The impact of the E. Coli outbreak, which began in late Oct. 2024, has started to reveal the toll it took on McDonald’s performance. Citi analyst Jon Tower said in a research note that he believes the outbreak marked the company’s “low point” and sees the coming quarter as “setting the table” for a recovery. However, inflation remains a challenge and is expected to persist in the near future. Jan. 2025 was another tough month for McDonald’s, despite optimism surrounding its McValue platform. BTIG analyst Peter Saleh noted that severe weather conditions across the U.S. complicated efforts to determine whether the value menu had increased foot traffic. In a note covering the restaurant industry, Bank of America set a 12-month price target of $312 for McDonald’s, reflecting steady growth expectations despite the challenges of its franchised business model. In Nov. 2024, the company announced a $100 million investment to support marketing efforts and franchisee operations. About 95% of U.S. locations are run by franchisees. BoA highlighted both upside and downside risks: Stronger-than-expected sales and cost savings could boost McDonald’s stock, while slow sales and margin pressure from inflation could weigh on its performance. According to foot-traffic analytics firm Placer.ai, inflation likely contributed to dips in McDonald’s visits, while budget-conscious consumers flocked to limited-time offers and special releases. The company has capitalized on this trend, driving significant foot traffic with the June launch of its $5 Meal Deal. Additionally, the Chicken Big Mac, introduced in Oct. 2024, drove a 7.2% increase in visits during its first week. The promotions help McDonald’s maintain its relevance. The company recently launched a “McValue” menu, expanding on its $5 meal deal. It’s also bringing back the Shamrock Shake. Other nostalgic promotions, such as collector’s cups relaunched in Aug. 2024, have proven extremely successful. The cups were so popular that customers resold them on third-party websites such as eBay for as much as $100 each. Elsewhere, McDonald’s also made headlines in Oct. 2024 when President Donald Trump staged a cook shift at a Pennsylvania location. The company quickly clarified it had no involvement in the event, noting that it was not “red or blue, but golden.” In Jan. 2025, McDonald’s announced it would scale back its Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) efforts, joining the likes of Google, Meta, and Walmart — but not Costco.
