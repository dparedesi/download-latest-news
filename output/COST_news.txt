Plus: Two In Five Executives Feel Unprepared For Market Shocks, Interest Rates Hold Steady For Now, Trump Creates A U.S. Sovereign Wealth Fund, Unions Score Wins While The NRLB Gets A Loss The whipsawing news about tariffs and trade wars during the last few days has caused confusion, quick calculations and frantic negotiations between global business partners. However, according to BCG’s most recent Executive Perspectives study, 85% of businesses have been preparing for this eventuality since Donald Trump won the presidential election in November, and more than 60% of executives have increased concerns about tariffs. Does that mean they’re ready for all that’s been going on? Not exactly. The study found that two in five executives feel unprepared for this latest round of market shocks, despite the previous five years characterized by market shocks: the Covid-19 pandemic, supply chain issues, war in Ukraine and the Middle East and high inflation. The balance of executives’ outlook toward market stability has also shifted this year. In North America, just 29% are optimists—a drop of 6% from 2024—while 19% are pessimists—an increase of 4% from last year. Business leaders’ financial mettle has been tested vigorously over the last few days with a raft of announcements about tariffs. On Friday, President Trump said he was enacting his first set of tariffs, which were to go into effect today: 25% on imports from Mexico and Canada, and 10% on China. Global markets dropped, and leaders went into negotiating mode. By the end of the day Monday, tariffs on Mexico and Canada were postponed for 30 days—Mexico promised to deploy 10,000 Mexican soldiers to the border to prevent drug trafficking, and Canada is spending $1.3 billion on a joint task force designed to combat fentanyl, organized crime and money laundering. China’s tariffs are beginning as planned, with the Asian nation placing retaliatory 15% tariffs on several American-made goods, as well as U.S. companies. This type of news is difficult to keep up with, let alone use to forecast your business plans. And while many companies prepared for potential tariffs on China last year, steep tariffs on Mexico and Canada weren’t in many companies’ viewfinders. Forbes senior contributor Michael Lynch writes that how Trump appears to be using tariffs so far—as a threat unless other countries do something the United States wants—makes it especially difficult for U.S. businesses. The tariffs are largely unrelated to business outcomes. Even without the open question of tariffs, the U.S. economy is in a volatile situation right now, as quick decisions have far reverberations. Stephan Liozu, chief value officer at financial software company Zilliant, says that companies can do much better if CFOs have a handle on pricing and can make quick changes to respond to the larger economic situation. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell speaks after last week's Open Market Committee meeting. The seesawing news on tariffs rocked the markets this week. In the U.S., all markets fell on Monday morning, but recovered slightly after Trump announced the pause on Mexico’s tariffs. However, the three major indexes closed down—the Dow down 0.3%, the S&P lost 0.8% and the Nasdaq minus 1.2%. The pause on Canada’s tariffs was announced after markets closed on Monday, and stocks slowly moved toward a recovery. But tariffs are far from the only decision of the last week that’s shaped the economic picture. Last week the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee decided to hold interest rates steady at 4.25% to 4.5%. It was the first meeting since July at which rates were not cut. In the announcement, the committee noted unemployment “has stabilized at a low level” and “inflation remains somewhat elevated.” Trump responded to the Fed’s decision with a Truth Social post saying the body “has done a terrible job on Bank Regulation. But Forbes senior contributor Simon Moore notes that tariffs tend to be paid for by consumers and U.S. companies in terms of higher prices, potentially increasing inflation—and therefore lowering the chances of additional rate cuts. Inflation and economic stagnation are persisting. Commerce Department data released on Friday showed that inflation remained sticky, with the personal consumption expenditures index at 2.6% in December. GDP only rose 2.3% in the fourth quarter, slower than expected. President Donald Trump, between Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent at left and Commerce Secretary nominee Howard Lutnick, speaks to the press as he signs an executive order to create a U.S. sovereign wealth fund. New policy choices are also potentially reshaping the U.S.’s financial picture. On Monday, President Trump signed an executive order establishing a U.S. sovereign wealth fund—a state-owned fund that can invest in stocks, real estate, bonds, hedge funds and more that can insulate the government from economic stress. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said it would be set up in the next 12 months, though it’s unclear where the money will come from. Trump said that perhaps TikTok could be put into this sovereign fund “if we make the right deal.” In his first week in office, Trump signed an order to create a working group on cryptocurrency, potentially creating a national digital asset stockpile, wrote Forbes senior contributor Jason Brett. Trump has been interested in cryptocurrency throughout his campaign, with his family creating the World Liberty Financial crypto venture last year, and $TRUMP and $MELANIA meme coins issued right before the inauguration. Former Forbes staffer Steven Ehrlich talked to former chair of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission Timothy Massad about Trump’s crypto ventures. Massad said it’s good that the administration is focusing on digital assets and is hopeful it will lead to a framework encouraging responsible development of the tech, but he sees no need for a strategic crypto reserve. A Costco Wholesale store in Chicago. Polling has shown that recent union success has increased the number of Americans who like them, with workers unions receiving a 70% approval rating on a Gallup poll, writes Forbes senior contributor Teresa Ghilarducci. According to the Labor Department, 9.9% of the workforce was in a union in 2024, down slightly from 10% the year prior. But organized labor may face an uncertain future. Last week, Trump fired Democrat National Labor Relations Board member Gwynne Wilcox, leaving the board with just two members and unable to conduct business. Her dismissal may be challenged in court. In the last week, organized labor had earned some big wins. Costco reached a last-minute tentative contract agreement with about 18,000 employees in the International Brotherhood of Teamsters union, averting a strike that would have started over the weekend, affecting more than 50 Costco locations nationwide, writes Forbes senior contributor Pamela Danziger. Employees at a Philadelphia Whole Foods location also voted last week to join the United Food and Commercial Workers union, Danziger writes. The next step is for the union to negotiate a contract with the grocery chain’s owner, Amazon, which has just one unionized warehouse under its flagship business. Zilliant Chief Value Officer Stephan Liozu. From the looks of it, price management software Zilliant Chief Value Officer Stephan Liozu believes we’re entering a period of hyperinflation, with costs going up and down all the time. For companies to perform better in times like this, he said CFOs need to have a better handle on and control of pricing—something that four in five companies don’t have a team dedicated to looking at. I talked to him about how companies should look at prices and plan for an uncertain future. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. How should prices be set? Liozu: I recommend the three Cs of pricing. You have to know your cost inside and out, and now the cost is changing on a minute[-by-minute] basis. That’s very dynamic and includes goods coming from outside, inside. The second C is competition. You need to anticipate what your competitors are going to do. How are we going to manage that hybrid inflation and tariffs? Are we going to do it better than you? Are they going to raise or decrease prices, et cetera? Then you have customer value. Right now, the perceptions of value are changing, and that means that you need to be aware that they might consider your offers, your product or services differently. The three Cs are in play constantly, and these three Cs are informing smart pricing decisions. Unfortunately, most companies will look at cost only, especially in periods of stagflation and inflation, but they need to really anticipate what competition is going to do and also the perceptions of value from consumers. What advice would you give to CFOs today that are trying to figure all this out? Number one is to take ownership of pricing. If no one is doing it and you don’t have a pricing team, create a task force, create a council and make sure you bring all these parties at the table, and say: OK, we’re going to do this better in a dynamic way, and with the right data. Number two is look at how pricing is managed, how long it takes you to do updates. Make a case for better investment in faster systems [for] optimization, automation. It pays for itself in six months when you look at money you save on not giving the right price to the market. Number three, I would say rethink your strategy with the three Cs. Most CFOs will go and focus on cost cutting, cost optimization and doing the calculations. Don’t forget competition and value because there is still a lot of value that can be captured from customers. There are a lot of strategies you could do in products and services to increase the value for the price. We’ve been in a period of disruption for a long time—the Covid-19 pandemic, supply chain issues, war in Ukraine and the Middle East, and high inflation. But when things finally settle down again, do you think this focus on dynamic pricing will stay? Right now, disruption is the new constant. Based on how things are right now with China, Russia and trends around the world, we’re going to see ongoing disruption for the next 10 to 20 years. Which means you need to be automating, you need to have dynamic processes and systems, and you need to adapt your DNA to this kind of environment. If your company’s not prepared for that type of change, then you’re going to disappear. The CFO needs to raise that flag in the C-suite, but also has the responsibility to make sure on the side of risk management, this is managed internally. Because shareholders are going to look at this, and say, what are you doing?

Title: How Corporate Approaches To DEI Are Evolving

Plus: Uncertainty Is Stressing Executives Out, Even If They’re Expecting Success; Tariff Talk Brings A Tempest To The Markets; Retail Apocalypse Predicted To Continue; Unions Score Wins While The NLRB Sees A Loss A new study from insurance company Sentry underscores a point that is likely to become a theme this year: Executives are optimistic about how their businesses will fare in 2025, but they’re also a lot more stressed. While almost half of the 1,000 executives and business leaders said they think their business will thrive this year, two-thirds are more anxious than they were at this time in 2024. The stress comes from many places. A total of 47% are under duress because of economic uncertainty, while almost as many—44%—say supply chain challenges keep them up at night. Other major stressors are financial—41% are concerned about the cost of employee health care and 36% point to inflation. More than a third are worried about labor shortages. The stress and uncertainty are keeping some executives from doing anything except working harder. Nearly all—97%—said they’ve deferred needed upgrades to their equipment, technology, cybersecurity or facilities. And almost half are asking employees to work longer hours. Findings of AlixPartners’ annual disruption index echo these concerns. Following the 2024 presidential election, the number of U.S. leaders who said they were more anxious doubled, from 23% at the beginning of 2024 to 46%. In that survey, 27% were concerned about shifting their manufacturing and supplier footprints, and 23% felt they needed to modify growth plans in response to U.S.-China relations. About 15% more said they needed to change their business model faster, and 12% fewer expect revenue growth this year. The whiplash of 2025 may end as the year goes on, or businesses will get used to the economic climate. However, the stress could burn some executives out quickly. The current average tenure of a C-suite leader is about four years, according to an analysis published last year in SHRM’s Executive Network, but in times of tumult and stress on business, it has historically been shorter. One aspect of business that has seen significant change is support for diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. In the last year, many companies have moved away from their policies, and in his first weeks in office, President Donald Trump outlawed them in government. I talked to Cynthia Soledad, Egon Zehnder’s global head of DEI, about how this sentiment is reflected in boards of directors and C-suites. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. President Donald Trump talks to reporters about tariffs in the Oval Office. Considering the hours he devoted to talking about tariffs on the campaign trail and the massive changes made by executive orders so far, it’s almost surprising that Donald Trump waited two weeks to enact the trade taxes. The first targets were initially Canada and Mexico, which will see a 25% tariff on most imports starting on Tuesday, as well as China, which will get an additional 10% tariff. (Canadian oil tariffs will only be 10% to “minimize any disruptive effect” on U.S. gas prices.) Monday morning, Trump granted Mexico a one-month reprieve in exchange for 10,000 Mexican soldiers being deployed to the border to protect against drug trafficking. On Sunday, Trump acknowledged that tariffs may cause “some pain,” but said it “will all be worth the price.” Most economists say tariffs tend to get passed through to the consumer, increasing prices for all Americans. Meanwhile, Canadian leaders have proposed a list of U.S. goods that will see their own 25% tariffs—including some food items, plastics, rubber, lumber and glassware. The tariffs were immediately felt on the stock market. Trump’s announcement affirming the tariffs Friday afternoon quickly erased a positive day on Wall Street, with all three major indexes tumbling. On Monday morning, the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq were all down more than 1%, with alcohol companies, vehicle manufacturers, tech companies and cryptocurrency seeing the biggest losses. The reaction to the tariff announcement reinforces the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee’s decision last week to hold interest rates steady at 4.25% to 4.5%, the first meeting since July at which rates were not cut. In the announcement, the committee noted unemployment “has stabilized at a low level” and “inflation remains somewhat elevated.” Commerce Department data released on Friday showed that inflation remained sticky, with the personal consumption expenditures index at 2.6% in December, and GDP only rose 2.3% in the fourth quarter, slower than expected. Trump responded to the Fed’s decision with a Truth Social post saying the body “has done a terrible job on Bank Regulation.” A Big Lots in Carle Place, New York that was closing last year. It is not expected to be a good year for retail. A study from Coresight Research predicts that 2025 is on track to see twice as many stores close as 2024, writes Forbes senior contributor Pamela Danziger. Up to 15,000 stores may close this year, while only about 5,800 could open. The study found that inflation, easy online shopping deals and suboptimal in-store customer experience are contributing to the closures. The year has already seen quite a bit of M&A in the retail space, Danziger writes. The biggest to date is JCPenney merging with the SPARC Group into Catalyst Brands. Higher-end brands have also been making deals—like Vera Wang’s acquisition by WHP Global, Stella McCartney buying back LVMH’s stake, Christian Lacroix’s sale to Sociedad Textil Lonia and Laura Ashley’s acquisition by Marquee Brands. Other brands that have been bought so far include Kapital, True Religion and Urban Skin RX. A Whole Foods Market in Commack, New York. Polling has shown that recent union success has increased the number of Americans who like them, with workers unions receiving a 70% approval rating on a Gallup poll, writes Forbes senior contributor Teresa Ghilarducci. According to the Labor Department, 9.9% of the workforce was in a union in 2024, down slightly from 10% the year prior. But organized labor may face an uncertain future. Last week, Trump fired Democrat National Labor Relations Board member Gwynne Wilcox, leaving the board with just two members and unable to conduct business. Her dismissal may be challenged in court.

Employees at a Philadelphia Whole Foods location also voted last week to join the United Food and Commercial Workers union, Danziger writes. The next step is for the union to negotiate a contract with the grocery chain’s owner, Amazon, which has just one unionized warehouse under its flagship business. Egon Zehnder Global Head of DEI Cynthia Soledad. As scrutiny of diversity, equity and inclusion programs increased in 2024, the number of diverse individuals newly appointed to corporate boards decreased, though boards are more diverse than they were 12 years ago, leadership firm Egon Zehnder found in their 2024 global board diversity tracking report. President Donald Trump has also focused a number of executive orders on the topic in his second term. I talked to Cynthia Soledad, Egon Zehnder’s global head of DEI, about what this report means for diversity on boards, C-suite and corporate offices. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. A longer version is available here. There’s been a lot of demonizing DEI, but when you look at companies, a recent LinkedIn study showed nearly no companies cutting back on DEI. From where you sit, how does it break down? What are the actual feelings about DEI, both for boards and for corporations? Soledad: Starting with the corporate practices, I would say that the headlines are exaggerated. What is being called in a headline a “pullback” on DEI practices is usually not that. DEI work has evolved over time, particularly as regulatory and legal changes happen. For example, the affirmative action ruling a few years ago, and the subsequent legal test cases around corporate practices that look similar to affirmative action. Those regulatory shifts and changes in test cases do require companies to evaluate their practices and ask, ‘Is there anything that we would want to adapt and change because the regulatory environment’s changing?’ That's most of what I am hearing from the clients we work with: an evaluation given regulatory changes in the environment, not at all a rollback in terms of the importance of inclusive culture, diverse representation and continued investment. There is also a concern that, because of these headlines and sound bites, DEI is under attack and it affects morale. Companies are concerned that their employees will read these headlines and feel that these investments in inclusive culture are at some risk. I also am hearing from CHROs and DEI officers and CEOs that they are very focused on keeping employee engagement high, and helping those employees understand their levels of investment in DEI. How do you see President Trump's DEI policies in the federal government impacting the private sector? How about C-suites and boards? There is a ripple effect in the private sector partly because so many companies serve the federal government in some capacity, and these policies impact suppliers. In addition, these actions are obviously intended to sway public opinion. Even those companies who do not have government contracts will take note of the rhetoric, and their behavior could be influenced by the fear it is intended to create. The most direct possible impact is on corporate policies that influence supplier diversity, talent, and culture; impact to board diversity efforts could be softer. Nonetheless, these efforts are at some risk. Where do you see things going with the conversation around diversity, both as a policy in corporations, as well as with boards, in 2025? We can expect the landscape to continue to be fraught for the next year on this topic, with potentially more legal challenges to come. Because of this, companies will have to keep evolving their approaches. The commitment that companies, corporate leaders and board leaders have made to diversity and inclusion in companies is real. There is a core belief that companies are serving diverse customer bases, companies already have more diverse workforces than they have historically, and that they want to hold onto the best talent that they can. The core practices will remain steady. Companies are continuing to invest in building diverse pipelines of talent all the way up to the top, all the way up to board representation. Leaders say they want to protect that work, and to try to move through all of the distracting headlines as quickly as possible and stay focused on the core work. Apple reported record quarterly profits last week, but in some areas it missed analysts’ expectations. $124.3 billion: Net sales in the most recent quarter, up 4% year-over-year 11%: Year-over-year decline in China sales ‘Where we launched Apple Intelligence, performance outpaced the markets where we did not’: CEO Tim Cook said on the earnings call The board of directors is more than just a check on the CEO nowadays.
