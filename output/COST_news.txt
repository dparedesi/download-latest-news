Dear friends, Welcome to the March issue of Mutual Fund Observer. I am surprised, sometimes, at how much I now appreciate some of the stuff that I found most mindless and annoying in high school. (I’m still not there with Moby Dick; the whole idea of a monomaniacally obsessed old guy leading his ship to destruction because he can’t be reasoned with and won’t back down, just strikes me as implausible, but I’m willing to listen.) My secret hope as a professor is that I’m like the gardener scattering seeds too early, in patches that seem disconsolate, for those seeds still sprout whither they would. And so, I teach my students about Thorstein Veblen, one of his age’s most impenetrable geniuses (he coined “conspicuous consumption”), and Sherry Turkle, one of our age’s most thoughtful, who asks “What do we become when we talk to machines?” We read about Hitler, and about the disastrous misjudgments – by mainstream politicians who had faith that they could control him and German industrialists who had faith that they could harness him to their everlasting profit – that led to the rise of Hitler. We read the reflections of the decent, hardworking Germans who convinced themselves that it was better to keep their heads down and pray. This separation of government from people, this widening of the gap, took place so gradually and so insensibly, each step disguised (perhaps not even intentionally) as a temporary emergency measure or associated with true patriotic allegiance or with real social purposes. And all the crises and reforms (real reforms, too) so occupied the people that they did not see the slow-motion underneath, of the whole process of government growing remoter and remoter. . . (A German professor speaking with Milton Mayer, They Thought They Were Free: The Germans, 1933-45. University of Chicago Press, 1955) We read the final report of Herbert Hoover’s 1929 Committee on Recent Economic Changes that hailed an “almost insatiable appetite for goods and services,” and envisaged “a boundless field before us … new wants that make way endlessly for newer wants, as fast as they are satisfied.” The kids from Nepal and Mongolia read it alongside the kids from Naperville and Milwaukee, read it very differently from one another, and speak to each other with increasing confidence about how they connect to the readings … and connect to each other. And so, in the spring of my 41st year at the college, I’ll continue scattering seeds and nurturing hope. Heck, perhaps one day they’ll reflect on my classes as I’ve reflected on Dickens. “It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of light, it was the season of darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair.” ― Charles Dickens, A Tale of Two Cities (1859) Our colleague Lynn Bolin continues looking at bonds as an attractive alternative, on a risk-adjusted and valuation basis, to stocks just now. “Spicy Bond Funds” explores “spicier” (higher-yielding) bond investments in the current market environment. Lynn analyzes various risk factors including inflation, duration risk, and policy uncertainty, and provides a comprehensive ranking system for bond funds. Spoiler: you might want to check Janus Henderson AAA CLO ETF (JAAA) as a relatively safe way to achieve higher yields in the current market, Lynn complements that with a new take on an old strategy, bond laddering. In “ETF Bond Ladders,” he examines ETFs designed for bond laddering, focusing on products from Invesco (BulletShares) and BlackRock (iShares iBonds). The essay concludes with the note that corporate BBB-rated bond ladders will be Lynn’s mainstay investment, with potential additions of high-yield bonds for near-term investments and municipal bonds for tax-efficient accounts. In “The Great Rotation” (below), I highlight the surprising extent of the change in stock investors’ preferences – small, value, international, and emerging are being rediscovered – and offer up the funds that should be on an investor’s shortlist. Not to put too fine a point on it, but the Trump administration has gutted efforts to minimize global warming, coordinate international responses to it, or maintain a credible information infrastructure for it. In January we noted that the necessary response to allowing such a collapse was a shift to infrastructure investing to manage the effects. In February, we extended the analysis to water infrastructure. In “The Climate Denial Profit Paradox,” we update the state of government efforts and lay out additional investing opportunities. (I’ll go back to being optimistic about the future next month.) After markets get pricier and shakier, asset managers are doing what asset managers do: they’re rolling out new products in new asset classes using new algorithms that guarantee that happy days will be here again. After walking through the sad wreckage of other “can’t miss” innovations, we highlight the risks surrounding three new funds and ETFs in “Liquid Promises, Illiquid Reality.” All of which brought to mind the stunning collapse of Firsthand Technology Value Fund, a tale that continues to this day. Launched in 1994, the fund returned 60% a year in the 1990s and gave rise to a half dozen siblings. Twenty years after launch it became a business development company doing private equity investing in the same sorts of tech companies. And ten years later, the fund is trading for $0.06/share and isn’t even able to liquidate. The cautionary tale is in “The Rise and Fall of Firsthand Technology Value Fund.” Speaking of rising and falling, The Shadow documents the death of Matthews Asian Growth & Income, a fund made famous by Paul Matthews and Andrew Foster as the least volatile, most consistently excellent way to invest in Asia equities from 1994 to about 2011. But thereafter … We can establish two things about the stock market with great confidence: The US stock market has a giant problem. “Giant” in the sense that investors have poured money so steadily and so long into a handful of leaders that their valuations are beginning to redefine “irrational.” Jason Zweig notes, “Even after the stumble in tech stocks late last month, the Magnificent Seven traded this week at an average of 43.3 times what analysts expect them to earn over the next 12 months” (“What You Should Do About the Stock Market’s Giant Problem,” com, 2/7/25). That leaves most of the US market and virtually all of the rest of the world with tolerable valuations. Spencer Jakab reports that “developed-market large growth stocks were trading last week at 98th-percentile valuations… [meaning] they have been more expensive only 2% of the time.” (Ever.) Simultaneously, “developed-market large value is at the 2nd percentile, so it has been cheaper only 2% of the time” (“Stocks have a big, expensive problem,” WSJ, 2/25/25, B10). Morningstar pictures it this way: Source: Morningstar.com, Market Valuation View, 2/28/2025 Leuthold Group reports that small caps are selling at a 26% discount to large caps, adjusted for earnings, and value is selling at a near-historic discount to growth. Investors have noticed. As of March 3, 2025, Vanguard Value ETF is up 4.5% on the year, Vanguard Growth ETF is down 1.2%. Similarly, the Vanguard FTSE EM ETF is up 1.6%, Vanguard Total International Stock ETF is up 5.7% and the value-oriented Vanguard International High Dividend Yield ETF is up 6.6%. Contrarily, the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF is down 6% YTD. Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF is down 2%. Tesla is down 27% YTD. Google is down 10%. Trump Media & Tech is down 32%. All of this is separate from broader concerns about chaos, tariffs, reciprocal tariffs, escalating tariffs, government shutdowns, and burgeoning deficits. What might an investor consider? If you’re a young investor with a diversified portfolio (think more than 50 stocks representing many different industries, ideally spread over several countries), do nothing to your portfolio. You’re fine. This might be unpleasant, but that’s part of the price of playing the game. If you’re an investor with all of your eggs in one small basket (you have a tech ETF and shares of Nvidia, Google, and Amazon), broaden your exposure. That doesn’t mean selling what you own. It might mean adding something like Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP). At base, the equal weight 500 counteracts the large/growth/momentum biases embedded in many portfolios. It gives equal exposure to the largest and smallest companies in the S&P 500 which creates an immediate contrarian balance. It is more oriented toward less expensive stocks, smaller stocks, old-economy stocks, and dividends than the S&P or the typical portfolio. In Morningstar terms, it is a one-star fund which is precisely its appeal: it invests in the companies left for dead by the FAANG/MAG7 mania. If you want to increase your exposure to value-oriented stocks, consider Wisdom Tree US Value ETF (WTV) or Goodhaven Fund (GOODX). Why these two? We turned to the MFO Premium screener which allows us to assess open-end funds, closed-end funds, and exchange-traded funds side-by-side. We screeners for funds with three essential characteristics: We applied that screener to large value, mid-cap value, and multi-cap value funds for the past three years. Thirty-four value funds and ETFs showed both excellent manager performance and excellent resilience over the past three years. Wisdom Tree US Value had the highest information ratio of all, and Goodhaven had the highest ratio for all mutual funds. If you want to increase your exposure to small cap stocks, consider Vanguard Strategic Small Cap Equity, North Square Dynamic Small Cap, or Adirondack Small Cap. Vanguard Strategic Small Cap Equity is an actively managed, low-cost small-cap blend fund that holds about 500 names (yikes! But it works) with a growth-at-a-reasonable-price discipline. It charges one-third of the category average and is about as diversified as can be. North Square Dynamic Small Cap employs a systematic, quantitative approach to identify behavioral inefficiencies in small-cap equity markets, leveraging sophisticated data science to exploit pricing dislocations caused by investor biases. That “behavioral finance” angle is fairly distinctive. Adirondack Small Cap is the top-performing small value fund, earning a remarkable 11% annual return in one of the market’s left-for-dead categories. The fund specializes in identifying undervalued small-cap companies that have fallen out of favor with investors, seeking to capitalize on these “turnaround situations” before mainstream investors take notice. They target companies that might rebound within three years. The team has been around forever and is heavily invested in the fund. If you want to increase your exposure to international stocks, consider the Janus Henderson Global Research or Moerus Worldwide Value. The Janus Henderson Global Research is a global large-cap growth fund that employs a distinctive sector-driven approach where specialized teams of dedicated sector analysts build high-conviction portfolios of their best ideas worldwide. They also work to hedge away most macroeconomic risks leaving the portfolio performance mostly driven by stock selection. Moerus Worldwide Value is a globally unconstrained deep value fund managed by Amit Wadhwaney, who employs a disciplined approach to identifying companies trading at significant discounts to intrinsic value across developed and emerging markets, with a particular emphasis on strong balance sheets over income statements. Amit has three decades of value investing experience and willingness to embrace market turmoil as an opportunity, seeking out underfollowed businesses, complex situations, and temporarily distressed sectors that most investors avoid, creating a distinctive portfolio of 30-40 high-conviction holdings with minimal index overlap. And if you’re simply freaked out, (a) welcome to the club and (b) increase the strategic cash allocation in your portfolio. Cash and cash alternatives are paying 4-5% a year with minimal downside. If you don’t have any great conviction in risk assets, take a deep breath and invest in some variation of an ultra-short bond fund or money market. CrossingBridge is run by David Sherman & co., and they have an outstanding record of low-risk income investing. Fidelity Conservative Income is a cheap, active, middle-of-the-road ultra-short bond fund. The “cheap” is really useful here. We’ve also included the profile of the money market peer group. In reality, there’s no downside to any of them and precious little upside deviation. So, the whole group sits at 4.2% give-or-take 0.2%. Pick whichever one is convenient to you if you don’t want the prospect of adding just a bit of upside with CrossingBridge or Fido. The bottom line: running around in panic is not your friend. Hiding is not your friend. Taking a deep breath and making rational adjustments is. We’ll help. March has been designated as “B Corp Month.” Hallmark has not yet taken notice. In an era of growing disillusionment with traditional corporate structures, B Corps stand as beacons of a more conscientious approach to business. While many companies prioritize profits at any cost, Benefit Corporations (B Corps) represent a revolutionary paradigm that balances financial success with positive social and environmental impact. B Corps are businesses that meet rigorous standards of social and environmental performance, accountability, and transparency. Unlike conventional corporations that answer primarily to shareholders, B Corps legally commit to considering all stakeholders: workers, customers, suppliers, community, and the environment. In the US, 2,400 corporations are organized as B Corps. Worldwide, that swells to 9,500. What makes B Corps worth celebrating? They’re proving that business can be a force for good. From fair wages and diverse workforces to sustainable sourcing and ethical production, these companies demonstrate that profit and purpose aren’t mutually exclusive, they’re mutually reinforcing. The B Corp movement isn’t just idealism; it’s pragmatism for our times. As consumers increasingly vote with their dollars for companies that reflect their values, B Corps are showing that ethical business practices create resilience, innovation, and long-term success. The Annual Report of B Lab documents a lot of ways in which these companies really are different. I am not surprised, though I am slightly appalled, by the speed with which Corporate America as a whole has thrown all principles except shareholder (and executive) gains under the bus. By supporting the good guys, you aren’t underwriting the swift abandonment of employees, communities, and the environment by the billionaire-dollar corporations that were cheerleading for it, flying rainbow flags, and signing on to global initiatives … for precisely as long as it was convenient. Support how?? Follow B Lab Global, the certifying body, on social media (LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook, X) and follow the #GenB or #BCorpMonth hashtag to see the different stuff happening throughout March. You can also use the ‘Find a B Corp’ directory to discover businesses that are part of the community and use your purchasing power to support B Corp companies, and the movement of business as a force for good. You might also consider Bookshop.org as an ethical alternative to Amazon, at least as a bookseller. They’ve donated $36+ million in profits to local bookshops since their launch during Covid. Nice people, good selection. Amazon has recently changed policy, they now forbid Kindle users from downloading their books, giving them permanent control of your purchases. (You might recall their freakish decision to remove the book 1984 from all Kindle readers a few years ago.) Bookshop has e-books and is working with folks like Kobo to make them available on readers. Similarly, a handful of major retailers have recognized the business case of sustaining a diverse and vibrant workforce and have, to date, refused to roll back corporate efforts to support their employees. Those include Costco, Crate & Barrel, Home Depot, Ikea, Kroger, Sprouts Wayfair, West Elm … and Whole Foods (?).

To, Sara from Brooklyn, Charles of Michigan, Ronald from Alexandria, Marjorie (thank you, ma’am, I also get such a headache some days) of Chicago, The Grinch Redux, and dear Binod from Houston, thanks! And for more than just financial support. You make a difference. It’s planting time. Chip is busily searching seed catalogs for spring-planted garlic (stiff neck mostly, because they generate delicious garlic scapes) and mild onions. I’ll continue searching for the perfect potato. And somewhere in there, more native wildflowers and grass (sheep fescue looks cool) will continue their relentless incursion on our lawn. Planting is an act of hope. Gardening is a gesture of resilience. Pursue both, dear friends. As ever, David Snowball, PhD (Massachusetts). Cofounder, lead writer.

Title: McLaren sponsor Glanbia faces struggle convincing investors it can get back on track

The McLaren Formula One racing team was euphoric on Wednesday when its star driver, Lando Norris, set the pace for the field in the first day of preseason testing in Bahrain, before Melbourne hosts the initial grand prix of 2025 next month. The mood wasn’t shared, however, by the owners of McLaren’s sports nutrition sponsor, protein powders business Optimum Nutrition. Shares in Glanbia, which bought Optimum Nutrition in 2008 and turned it into a $1 billion-plus (€960 million) concern, went into sharp reverse the same day – slumping 23 per cent – as it warned that a surge in whey protein prices had caught its team off guard, and it went about getting rid of its problem SlimFast and Body & Fit businesses. It has caused investors to seriously question the Kilkenny-based group’s ability to forecast the price of the key ingredient for its products – and its deal making. Glanbia is the biggest producer of whey protein in the US through its cheese joint venture factories in Idaho, New Mexico and Michigan. But it is also the world’s main buyer of the commodity to stock the cupboards of gym-goers and dieters with protein powers and shakes. Chief executive Hugh McGuire, who succeeded Siobhán Talbot at the helm a year ago, rattled investors in November when he signalled that high whey prices would weigh on margins in its biggest division, Performance Nutrition, where Optimum Nutrition accounts for two-thirds of sales. He conceded this week that the scale and extent of the spike – with high-end whey prices currently 20 per cent above a previous peak in 2022 – was “beyond what we previously planned for”. It has prompted analysts to slash their earnings estimates for the next few years. The company’s full-year earnings per share guidance of $1.24-$1.30 was above 11 per cent below what analysts, on average, had been estimating. Chief financial officer Mark Garvey – who was last year granted a stock incentive award, worth €750,000 at the time, to remain with the company for at least two years as McGuire’s right-hand man – told analysts the elevated prices will be “transitory”. That’s because plans by cheese producers in the US to build new plants, following a pause in projects as a result of the Covid pandemic, will increase capacity by 15-20 per cent between late 2025 and through next year. History suggests that increased capacity will push down prices, he said. But ongoing weakness in the stock suggests the market is short on faith as the episode stokes up memories of an unfortunate series of profit warnings from the group in 2019. “This is the second whey-driven downgrade in three to four months and, given the current trajectory of prices, we struggle to have conviction at this point on a moderation in prices,” said Deutsche Numis analyst Deirdre Mullaney. Glanbia sees higher whey prices resulting in $200 million of additional costs this year. It aims to offset three-quarters of that, mainly by way of increasing prices and cutting its marketing budget. It will be difficult to achieve, without hitting volumes. Optimum Nutrition sales barely rose last year as Glanbia cut pricing to boost volumes in the face of heightened competition as the likes of Costco, the members-only warehouse club retailer, launched low-cost powders at a time of consumer caution – and habitual dieters opted for weight-loss drugs such as Ozempic in droves. Still, Glanbia executives believe their protein powders should ultimately benefit from the GPL-1 revolution. However, strong sales outside the US helped lift the brand’s total revenues by 7.5 per cent. Glanbia’s decision to get rid of SlimFast shouldn’t surprise. Talbot purchased SlimFast for $350 million in late 2018 (a fraction of the $2.9 billion Unilever had spent on it in 2000) and managed a mini revival of a brand that had its heyday in the 1980s and 1990s, as it played into the low-carb keto diet craze. The pandemic put paid to that fad. Ozempic hasn’t helped. Glanbia took a $91 impairment charge against the asset last year as it prepares it for sale. Dutch-based Body & Fit, an online sales platform for protein bars, wraps and powders that Glanbia bought in 2017 for €181 million to open a new sales front to consumers, has also had its day. The explosive growth of Shopify Amazon since then means that running a specialist ecommerce platform is an expense Glanbia doesn’t need. The group took a $46 million charge against this asset last year as it put it on the block. Analysts from Berenberg to Kepler Cheuvreux have welcomed management’s decision to hive off SlimFast and Body & Fit, as neither deal delivered what was hoped for. But it does raise questions about the group’s ability to identify attractive deals. The general view from analysts is that the stock has been oversold this week. “The loss on the share price seems excessive,” said Fatma-Agnes Hamdani, an analyst with Oddo BHF Securities. “Glanbia remains well positioned to take advantage of the strong trend on whey protein, while waiting for supply to normalise from the second half [of 2025] onward. We think that 2025 will be a transitional year.” They point out that the group’s balance sheet remains strong, allowing it to buy back €102 million of shares last year and for the board to sign off on a further €148 million of stock repurchases going forward. Goodbody Stockbrokers analyst Patrick Higgins said on Friday that Glanbia’s shares – changing hands at a little over €11 – are now trading at “a significantly greater than warranted discount” to peers. But he is struggling to find a catalyst for a stock rally to his €16.50 price target. A few quarters without any more nasty surprises might put it on the right track.

Title: February, 2024 in Precious Metals, by Everett Millman

Welcome to SurvivalBlog’s Precious Metals Month in Review, where we take a look at “the month that was” in precious metals. Each month, we cover gold’s performance and silver’s performance and examine the factors that affected the metal prices. Even during the shortest month of the year, the precious metals markets packed in quite a lot of action. Prices ended basically back where they started, but there was a good deal of volatility in between. Both silver and gold rose on each of the first three trading days of February. The gold price advanced 2.4% over that span, reaching an all-time high of $2,861 per troy ounce on Feb. 5th. During that same period the silver price added 3.5%. Silver gave back 47 cents on Friday, Feb. 7th before rebounding back above the $32/oz mark the following Monday. Spot gold closed above $2,900/oz for the first time ever that same day, Feb. 10th. The metals bounced up and down throughout the week of Valentine’s Day. Gold touched yet another new record high of $2,929/oz on Thursday, Feb. 13th, yet it sold off rather swiftly the next day. On Tuesday, Feb. 18th, the yellow metal notched yet another all-time high above $2,930 while silver jumped 41 cents higher to $32.78/oz. The silver price reached its high point for the month on Feb. 20th, closing just six cents shy of the key $33/oz level. The final week of February saw gold snap its streak of eight consecutive weekly gains, but not before it registered one more record-high price of $2,953/oz on Monday, Feb. 24th. The next day saw both precious metals suffer a swift downward correction: the gold price lost 1.3% during the trading session and spot silver shed 68 cents to fall to $31.65/oz. The same pattern repeated on Feb. 27th and 28th, with two more days of losses to close the month. Silver erased all of its gains from the first three weeks of February to end at $31.08/oz, 0.2% lower than where it started. Gold finished at $2,853/oz, an increase of $60 (+2.1%). The focus of the metals market over the past several weeks has echoes of Jan from The Brady Bunch: tariffs, tariffs, tariffs! These newly-erected trade barriers are affecting the whole of the commodities complex, with prices climbing for natural gas, eggs, coffee, orange juice, and a slew of other natural resources. As I cautioned in January, however, the explanation that tariffs are the primary force driving precious metals prices higher is likely to be proven incorrect in retrospect. Something much bigger is playing out with regard to a realignment of the global monetary order. A bold claim, to be sure. But let us consider the following: There has been an alarmingly heavy flow of physical gold out of hubs in London and Switzerland and into vaults in New York. The volume of gold bars crossing the Atlantic is estimated to be 2,000 metric tons in a span of two months. In the meantime, the idea of auditing the gold held in Fort Knox is legitimately being floated around. Even the Treasury Secretary of the United States is openly talking about a new Bretton Woods, for crying out loud. Not since the 1970s has the reality that gold is money been more glaringly present in the public consciousness. The normally staid Financial Times described it as “the unimaginable becomes imaginable.” These are nearly unprecedented developments. Undoubtedly some of the volatility in the gold market can be explained by the unpredictable responses by governments around the world to the fast pace of changes being enacted by the Trump administration. Recent action in the broader financial markets indicates that money is rushing to the sidelines, with investors preferring to wait out the storm from safer harbors. Aside from what’s going on in the White House, the U.S. Congress is considering a budget that purportedly cuts spending by $2 trillion. Although it is true that these fiscal austerity measures would be a welcome change from the outright profligacy we’ve come to expect from the D.C. Beltway, they will almost certainly have a deflationary effect—which, on the one hand, should help quell inflation, but on the other hand it may cause the economy to contract sharply for a time. Meanwhile, there has been far less headline-worthy news about silver, other than some reasonable questioning about why governments don’t hold silver reserves in addition to gold. (Mexico, India, and the United States did so in the past, but to my knowledge the only one that does today is the Russian central bank.) Note to readers: Most data about international gold reserves are delayed by a month. They are not typically reported to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and are instead compiled by private organizations such as the World Gold Council (WGC). Total central bank gold purchases in 2024 clocked in at 1,045 tons. It was the third straight year exceeding 1,000 tons and the 15th consecutive year of net purchases. According to the IMF, the Central Bank of Taiwan bought 1 ton of gold in October. It holds 424 tons in total. The People’s Bank of China purchased 5 tons of gold in January, bringing its (officially reported) stockpile to 2,285 tons—equivalent to 73.45 million troy ounces. The central bank of Uzbekistan added 8 tons of gold to its reserves in January. It has 391 tons in total. The Reserve Bank of India bought 3 tons of gold in January. It holds 879 tons overall. The National Bank of Kazakhstan bought 4 tons of gold in January, increasing its reserves to 288 tons. The Qatar Central Bank added 1.3 tons of gold reserves in January for a total of 112.1 tons. The State Oil Fund of Azerbaijan increased its gold holdings by 20 tons in the fourth quarter of last year. It bought 45 tons over the course of 2024 and holds 147 tons of gold in aggregate (21% of its total assets). The fund says it plans to buy more gold in 2025, making it perhaps the only sovereign wealth fund to state this publicly. January tends to be the strongest month on the calendar in terms of silver sales at the United States Mint, and this year was no different. The mint sold 3,563,000 of its 1 oz American Silver Eagle coins during the month. It additionally sold 63,500 oz of Gold Eagle coins. A surprising amount of the gold coin sales were for half-ounce and quarter-ounce coins; this is probably because of bullion stackers who wanted a collection of the new 2025-dated coins across all denominations. While still incomplete, the latest February production data show 514,000 Silver Eagles sold and 4,000 oz of gold coins sold. Scrap silver companies are seeing a 50% reduction in volume in 2025 compared to 2021, suggesting the physical supply of silver remains abnormally tight. In an almost unheard-of turn of events, the mainstream news is regularly talking about gold. Even CNBC and Bloomberg are covering the Treasury Department potentially revaluing its gold reserves, which technically still sit on the Treasury’s books at a value of just $42.22 per ounce. Senator Rand Paul voiced support for a Fort Knox gold audit as the idea continues to gain momentum. The Shanghai Futures Exchange experienced a record-high daily outflow of silver on Feb. 19th. Exports of gold from Singapore to the U.S. hit a three-year high in January. London’s gold shortage may be a symptom of global economic anxiety, according to ZeroHedge. London vaults have lost 11% of their silver inventory in the last two months. As has been widely discussed, much of those outflows are ending up in U.S. warehouses. Accordingly, gold lease rates—i.e. the cost for banks to borrow gold—continue to skyrocket in London. Similarly, the fees to borrow shares of the GLD ETF are exploding higher. Gold delivery notices for February on the COMEX hit a record high, even above the 2020 spike during covid. Major Swiss and German gold refiners are experiencing stress and have resorted to either imposing hefty surcharges or suspending orders altogether. Switzerland’s gold exports in January swelled to 235 tons, with 193 tons going to the U.S. alone. Sanctioned Russian gold bars are still finding their way to Swiss refineries. 7 out of 10 wealthy Koreans report investing in gold. Banks in South Korea are seeing a shortage of silver bars amid rabid demand. The country’s government mint announced it is no longer supplying gold bars to commercial banks following the Korea Gold Exchange making the same move in November. Likewise, banks in China are simply running out of gold. The Chinese mega-retailer JD.com is also out of stock of many gold bars. Costco is facing delays in shipments of precious metal products. (Yes, even Costco sells gold and silver.) Gold bullion banking is launching in Indonesia. It’s estimated that 1,800 tons of gold are held privately by Indonesian citizens. Lawmakers in Wyoming approved a plan to buy $10 million worth of gold for a state strategic reserve. Legislation advanced in Idaho to cut taxes by over $250 million, including removing any capital gains tax on gold and silver. The Montana legislature is currently considering a bill that would do the same. The Virginia legislature unanimously passed a bill to exempt bullion from sales tax until 2027. Goldman Sachs increased its year-end gold price forecast to the range of $3,100–$3,300/oz. Analysts at Bank of America have been “discussing” a gold price target of $3,500/oz. The “In Gold We Trust” report published by Incrementum has a probability-weighted gold price of $4,000–$5,000 by the year 2030. We can hope that March will bring more clarity to the global trade war that’s brewing, but all bets are off at this rate. Even though across-the-board tariffs on Canada and Mexico were postponed until April 2nd, the president has already announced 10% tariffs on Chinese exports; 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports; potential duties on copper imports; and a possible 25% tariff on all exports from the European Union. (This list is far from exhaustive.) Maybe this high level of uncertainty will continue to fuel gold’s steady march higher, as we’ve seen throughout 2025. It will also be important to keep tabs on the U.S.-led negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, as well as the proposed resolution to the conflict in Gaza. The Federal Reserve will meet again on March 18th and 19th. The Fed won’t have another opportunity to adjust interest rates until May. As was suggested here last month, $33 per ounce was a key ceiling for the silver price to break through if a rally higher was in the offing. Alas, it fell just short of that milestone and never quite recovered. Next month will be another opportunity. I stand by my conviction that silver will ultimately outperform gold by the end of the year. — About The Author: Everett Millman is a market analyst with Gainesville Coins.
