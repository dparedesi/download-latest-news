Target was the cool place to shop. Now it's everyone's favorite target. There are few activities more delightful than getting a little wine drunk and hitting up the local Target to go treasure hunting. Sure, you pretend you're there for a legitimate reason — to pick up toilet paper or trash bags. But whatever the plan was going in, you wind up with a basket full of random goodies: a bikini for a vacation you're not taking and party favors for a gathering you're not having. A yoga mat! Hot Cheetos! Five packs of gum! At Target, the world is your oyster in terms of stocking up on stuff you absolutely do not need. Even if you're doing Target sober, you wind up drunk on stuff. But lately, that Target trip has been a little less joyful, if you're even going at all. The Minneapolis-based retailer has been going through a rough patch as price-conscious consumers cut down on just-for-funsies buys that fuel Target's sales. And in terms of politics, it seems like Target can't get anything right. For the past two years, it's found itself at the center of America's culture wars, drawing the ire of conservatives and progressives alike. For some consumers, popping into Target (or refusing to) has turned into a political statement, though it's not clear what statement it even makes. Target can't decide what it stands for, ideologically. For many businesses, that's fine, but in Target's case, cultural relevancy is baked into the business model, and it keeps waffling on how it wants to be relevant. What Target stands for economically isn't working right now, either — it's operating from a place of weakness. The result: a Target that can't keep a, well, target off its back. If you want to get a sense of how things have been going for Target lately, just take a look at its stock price. Target shares are down by more than 30% over the past year and by over 50% since their 2021 peak. While its most recent quarterly earnings were generally in line with Wall Street's expectations, it hasn't reported strong financial results since the pandemic. The retailer also said sales were off in February because of the weather and "declining consumer confidence," and it has anticipated tariff-related price increases in a matter of days. Things are not working in Target's favor, in part, because it relies on discretionary spending — basically, the nonessentials. As people pull back on that kind of spending amid inflation and worries about the economy, that hits Target where it hurts. "People expect prices to rise, and that's causing people to spend more conservatively, and that's causing them to think twice about throwing this or that other thing into their cart," said Zak Stambor, a senior retail and e-commerce analyst at EMARKETER. "Target's business relies on people throwing this or that into their cart." (EMARKETER is owned by Axel Springer, the parent company of Business Insider.) Target is struggling to differentiate itself and compete against Walmart, Amazon, and Costco, said Michael Baker, a managing director and senior research analyst at D.A. Davidson. If a consumer's focus is product selection and wowing customers with compelling offers, Costco's the answer (or at least as good as Target). If it's convenience, it's Amazon. If it's price, Walmart wins. "That doesn't mean that Target can't find their niche," Baker said, but the niche it does have — wants and not needs — is one that doesn't work great in this environment. "With the wind at their back and people spending a lot on discretionary items, we think Target can compete reasonably well, but in a more difficult environment, the increased competition over the past decade or so, I think, makes it that much more difficult for them," he said. Target is also struggling to catch up in some booming areas that are working for its competitors, like groceries and e-commerce. Both efforts have been undertaken "halfheartedly," said Zhihan Ma, a senior research analyst at Bernstein. Target largely relies on its stores to fulfill online orders, which may be cheaper in terms of the up-front cost to implement, but it's very labor intensive, as associates are expected to deal with in-person shoppers and e-commerce customers in tandem. Beyond the slow-walked investments, one of the key differentiators for Target — a relatively enjoyable shopping experience — has been undercut in recent years. Target's attempts to fight retail theft mean more merchandise winds up locked up. Like with other retailers, some locations have problems with inventory shortages or crowded aisles. The result is a shopping experience that isn't a bang-up time, which is especially damaging for Target, where a bit of fun is part of the point. "The business is what the business is to a large extent," Stambor said. "Target is a place to find that cool other thing that you didn't expect to throw into your cart." While Target has been having a tough time financially over the past couple of years, it may be even worse when it comes to the news. Yes, there are some positive headlines about Stanley's "Wicked"-themed cups and everything it's doing with Taylor Swift. But there are a lot more negative headlines Target would rather not see. One of the ways Target has sought to differentiate itself from competitors is by embracing a rather cosmopolitan identity. It does collaborations and deals with designers, big-name brands, and celebrities. It tries to get higher-end consumers in the door. It's a bit fancy — there's a reason people use a little French accent to call it "Tar-jay." That means some of its consumers, particularly those who are more progressive leaning, expect more from it, and in some cases, Target has been happy to oblige. "In some ways, they're victims of their own success," Baker said. "Target has come to stand for fashion and fun and it is really a very culturally relevant retailer," he said, which puts it more in the crosshairs than Walmart and Amazon. As recently as 2020, Target was leaning into this identity. The Minneapolis-based retailer had positioned itself as a leader on racial justice in response to George Floyd's murder by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020. The moves seemed to go over well until 2023, when it stumbled into a series of culture-war woes. That year, many businesses faced a backlash after a Bud Light marketing campaign featuring the transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney sparked outrage among some consumers in the spring. Heading into the summer, Target's Pride month collection — something it's been doing for years — became the subject of right-ring focus. Some of the hullabaloo was completely made up, such as false social media reports that Target was selling "tuck-friendly" bathing suits for children. But the dust-up also moved from social media to the real world: Some angry shoppers were actually attacking associates and destroying store displays. Target scaled back its Pride collection, moving items to the back of the store in some locations and pulling some items altogether. It later said the backlash hurt sales. Since then, Target's been stuck in a loop of corporate identity indecision that it seems unable to get out of. The decision to scale back on Pride made no one happy — some consumers were already upset about the merchandise's existence in the first place, and others were upset because Target backed down. Target declined to comment for this story, but with regard to its diversity strategy and business outlook, a spokesperson pointed to links to its "Belonging at the Bullseye Strategy" and its fourth-quarter results. Target has taken a similar please-no-one approach when it comes to its diversity, equity, and inclusion policies. In January, the company said it was axing multiple DEI initiatives, including ending its three-year DEI goals, wrapping up a program to invest in Black-owned businesses, and stopping participation in external diversity-focused surveys. Target's DEI efforts and reversals have been met by resistance on several fronts. On the right, the retailer has been hit by a lawsuit brought by the state of Florida, among others, saying investors weren't made aware of the risks of Target's DEI initiatives and potential backlash. On the left, the Atlanta pastor Jamal Bryant has called for a 40-day boycott of Target over its DEI rollback. "Any time a company is visible, it's a target for activists who have one agenda or another," said Brayden King, a management professor at Northwestern. At a moment when much of corporate America is anxious about the political environment, Target, in particular, seems to be bearing the brunt of all these swirling emotions. Many people feel powerless when it comes to actual politics, so pouring their frustrations into things they can control — where and how they shop — turns into an outlet for some sort of action. The big issue, however, isn't that Target sold Pride merchandise or undertook DEI initiatives, it's that it so openly waffled on all of it. Again, it's similar to Bud Light: The near-ubiquitous beer brand did a tiny marketing campaign with a transgender influencer, and when that caught fire online among right-wing personalities, the company panicked and backed down instead of keeping calm and staying the course. When a company capitulates to backlash and cowers, it suggests what it initially did was incorrect — and ultimately pleases nobody. Wavering draws more attention to the issue. It signifies weakness — which, in the case of Target's business, is part of the problem. It also degrades trust with consumers and turns the company into a more obvious target for activists down the line. "That kind of seesawing back and forth and saying one thing and doing another, that's what gets brands like Target in trouble," said David Albert, the chief insights officer at Collage Group, a consumer research firm that focuses on multicultural audiences. "We've seen here, especially with Target, is that they've eroded that trust because they're not doing what they say and they don't say what they do." It's not clear how much the political noise will impact Target's bottom line. The 2023 Pride backlash did ding sales, but that was a temporary problem. As a general rule, the vast majority of boycotts don't work. Consumers are set in their ways and often prioritize convenience. If there's a Target down the street or a Walmart 30 minutes away, most people will stick with Target. Also, if you really start to worry about whether each and every business you interact with aligns exactly with your values, you will likely find there is nowhere on Earth you can shop. "Boycotts, of course, are very effective tactics for drawing attention to a cause," King said. "It will have this effect of making Target look bad. But do I think that it will affect what Target does? Probably not." Just because boycotts rarely work doesn't mean they never work. Bud Light, for one, really did see a decline in sales. The evidence is mixed on whether February's single-day "economic blackout" was effective, but there are at least some signs it may have moved the needle. Ma, from Bernstein, said it's too early to tell if the DEI-related backlash will hurt Target's long-term financials, but she acknowledged that it may introduce more "volatility" into its shorter-term results if it continues to find itself embroiled in cultural backlashes. "It doesn't help, for sure," she said. In terms of the business basics, Target has plans to get back some of that Tarjay sheen. It's amping up its private-label offering, creating more in-house brands that resonate with consumers and give them a reason to go to Target, specifically, rather than somewhere else. It's seeking out more flashy collaborations and partnerships, like with Warby Parker. It's scaling Target Plus, its third-party marketplace. It's still hoping consumers will do a spin around the store for those glorious little splurge buys on top of the basics. Still, in the retail landscape, Target isn't in a highly enviable position. Between price-sensitive consumers and tariff whiplash, the macroeconomic landscape is not stacked in its favor. And its soft business outlook means that in terms of the culture war, it's operating from a place of weakness, which raises the chances of making a misstep. Instead of companies worrying they're going to be the next Bud Light, they're likely starting to worry they'll be the next Target.

Two pastors sitting in a sunny window booth were contemplating a serious question: eggs or no eggs? Angelo Rodriguez and Wendell Yorkman met for breakfast on Monday at The Pancake Farm in Manheim Township. On the front door, a sign told customers a $1.50 upcharge would be added to any egg dish, due to the high cost of eggs. Yorkman was debating whether to get pancakes instead. “But then I remembered, my friend was paying,” he said. Rodriguez usually adds a third egg to his breakfasts, but this morning was weighing the upcharge. He recently went to pick up a few groceries for his daughter and looked at the price of a dozen eggs. “It was $8.75 and I said, you know what? She’ll be all right,” he said. Dr. Wendell Yorkman, of Mountville, left, and Pastor Angelo Rodriguez, of Lancaster, chat over breakfast at The Pancake Farm in Manheim Township on Monday, March 3, 2025. Local restaurants, bakeries and grocery stores are feeling the heat from rising egg prices aggravated by the ongoing avian flu outbreak that has taken a toll on the nationwide egg supply. As businesses scramble to keep up with soaring costs, consumers are left to decide if they are willing to spend extra for a breakfast staple and ingredient in many favorite recipes. One booth over from Rodriguez and Wendell, Robyn Weidner said she hasn’t been going out to breakfast as much because of price increases. Even at home, she’s eating less eggs. She was eating a lot of them as a source of protein while she’s in training for a half-marathon. Now she’s turning to other high-protein alternatives like oatmeal and chia seed pudding. “I'm not going out and spending $7.99 on a dozen eggs, I can guarantee you that,” Weidner said. “I'm a single mom, so absolutely not, no way.” READ: Trump opens the door to exempting eggs from tariffs levied on Canada and Mexico READ: Egg prices could jump 41% this year, USDA says, as Trump's bird flu plan is unveiled The average price of one dozen eggs nationwide has risen 96% from $2.52 in January 2024 to $4.95 in January this year, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. But that’s just an average. What Lancaster County residents are seeing can be much higher. Avian flu is a factor. In January 2022, before the outbreak started, one dozen grade A, large eggs cost $1.93 on average, nationwide. In its most recent egg markets overview report, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Agricultural Marketing Service said there are still inadequate egg supplies because of the ongoing avian flu outbreak, but there are signs the situation may be starting to improve. The USDA said the pace of the outbreak is slowing and the national egg inventory rose slightly at the end of February. The USDA said bird flu outbreaks in commercial table egg layer flocks in the first two months of this year resulted in the death of 30.1 million birds, 74% of which lived in conventional caged systems and produce the most common eggs that hit grocery store shelves. Following is the average price of a dozen grade A large eggs in the United States from January 2024 to this past January: Source: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Pennsylvania egg production during January totaled 681.8 million, a 4% decrease from the same time last year, according to the USDA. The state’s population of layer chickens was 6% lower in January, compared to the previous year. Since Feb. 6, more than 136,000 birds in Lancaster County have been affected by avian flu, according to the USDA, but none of them egg layers. Pennsylvania lost 1.9 million laying hens in Dauphin County and more than 85,000 in Lebanon County in early February. Shannon Powers, press secretary for the state Department of Agriculture, said the Shapiro Administration is working to keep costs down for consumers through a Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Recovery Fund, which helps farmers increase biosecurity measures and recover losses. She said the state’s investment in testing and a coordinated response to outbreaks also help farmers minimize the cost to their operations and protect against future harm. Powers said Pennsylvania ranks fourth in the nation in egg production and first in organic egg production. Eggs and other poultry products fall among Pennsylvania’s largest exports, worth $155.6 million. Many factors determine the cost of eggs, Powers said. “Canada and Mexico are two of our largest trading partners. Any negative changes to international trade could impact poultry farmers and the price of eggs,” she said. READ: Here's how Pa. is handling the latest outbreak of bird flu in Lancaster County The Pancake Farm owner Javier Camacho said prices are affecting his business. He said customer traffic is down around 25%. Camacho decided to add the $1.50 upcharge to egg meals a few weeks ago to deal with volatile prices, which he said was a hard decision. “Prices are changing every day,” Camacho said. “If we place an order today and a dozen is $8.25, tomorrow will be $8.75 a dozen.” Camacho said the restaurant uses up to 190 dozen eggs per week. He doesn’t want customers to think he’s using the eggs as an excuse to bring in more money; he said he has to think of his employees and business costs. The upcharge doesn’t apply to every meal. The pancake batter contains eggs, but pancakes don’t get the upcharge because, Camacho said, “they are our main thing.” A price increase on pancakes would be “devastating,” he said. Keith Thompson, of Reading, types in the table information so Marshmellow the mechanical helper knows where to take an order of poached eggs and chipped beef at The Pancake Farm in Manheim Township on Monday, March 3, 2025. Not everyone at The Pancake Farm is concerned. Most diners still have plates of eggs in front of them. “If I need eggs, I buy eggs,” said Nancy Sarley, who had just ordered poached eggs. “I'm just happy to wake up in the morning, I'm not looking at dirt, I’m not worried about the price of eggs,” said David Sarley. At Quarryville Family Restaurant, managing partner Andrew Morgan is torn on how to handle the price of eggs. The restaurant goes through 300 dozen of them per week. He hasn’t changed prices in about 10 months, he said, because he doesn’t want to upset his customers. A meal of two eggs, home fries, toast and bottomless coffee is $5.50 at the restaurant. “We have an awesome group of customers who are very loyal, who say, ‘you got to do what you got to do.’ But we also want to provide value for their hard-earned dollar,” Morgan said. An old purchase order put the issue in stark perspective for Morgan. He said the order shows he paid $31.39 for 30 dozen eggs three years ago. Today he is paying $250.59 for the same amount. “That’s a 700% increase,” he said. READ: Would tariffs hurt Lancaster County businesses, consumers? Here's what we know Brad Milliken, of Lititz, had a breakfast of bacon, eggs and hash browns at The Pancake Farm in Manheim Township on Monday, March 3, 2025. While grocery shopping, customers have to decide how important eggs are to them. At the Dutch-Way Farm Market in Ephrata Township, Kami Miller of Rothsville put one dozen eggs in her cart. “One dozen, that’s all I can afford,” she said, laughing. Miller said, since she moved to Rothsville about a year and a half ago, she’s watched the price of a dozen eggs jump from $1.99 to $5.99. She said she never really watched egg prices until now, and she’s been baking a lot less because of it. Larry Kauffman of East Lampeter Township wasn’t bothered much by the price. He said he always keeps eggs in the house. “I hate to see what they’ll be by Easter,” he said. Frances Eberly of Lititz glanced over the egg display before pushing her cart away. She said she had some eggs at home, so she didn’t need to buy more. Plus, she has a source outside the grocery store; a friend with chickens will sell her a dozen eggs for $3. “I guess if I needed them, I would pay that price,” she said. Eberly said eggs are in so many baked goods that she has cut back on baking because of the price. Scott Petersen, dairy manager at Dutch-Way Farm Market in Ephrata Township, stocks the egg display at the grocery store on Monday, March 3, 2025. Jordan Snader, a partner at Dutch-Way, said the market’s relationship with a local farm lets them keep a steady supply of eggs at a better price than some competitors. One dozen large white eggs were on sale for $5.99 as of Monday. Snader said customers are changing their patterns as egg prices rise, but he said they generally understand that it’s a nationwide problem. Some customers have turned to specialty eggs over commercial white eggs. Dave Dietz, produce and dairy manager at Lemon Street Market in Lancaster city, said it’s been a little challenging to keep eggs in stock. He said egg sales are up 40%-50% over last year. That’s likely because the market has high standards for eggs, Dietz said, usually offering pastured and organic varieties. Prices for specialty eggs haven’t jumped as dramatically as commercial white eggs. For example, Eagle Road brand brown, large eggs from non-GMO fed, pastured hens are priced at $5.49 per dozen, the cheapest eggs at Lemon Street Market. Prices range up to $9.99 per dozen for Alderfer brand brown, jumbo, organic eggs. READ: Middle Creek visitors must change their plans this snow geese season It’s one thing to skip eggs for breakfast. But eggs are a critical ingredient in many baked goods. Laura Wu, co-owner of Hello Mango Asian Bakery in Manheim Township, said she can no longer afford eggs from the wholesale company she was working with. Now she’s hunting for eggs at Costco, Restaurant Depot, and farm markets. It’s not just the price. “It is also difficult to find more eggs,” Wu said. “Everywhere has limits.” The bakery has had to raise prices by $2 for a 6-inch cake and $4 for an 8-inch cake. Wu said she is hoping prices drop in the spring. Erica Wolgemuth-Johnson is experimenting with using less eggs in some of her products at Erica Joy Bakes Gluten Free Creations in Lititz. She has experience baking without eggs; her shop specializes in vegan treats. “I was joking the other day that we’ll just go fully vegan,” Wolgemuth-Johnson said. But she said there are egg-heavy recipes that she will keep, because she created the recipes, like her honey-almond-lavender cake. She hasn’t raised prices so far, since gluten-free products are already a little more expensive and she doesn’t want to price people out. Wolgemuth-Johnson is avoiding making egg-heavy bakes for the shop’s display case. “I’m not going to make it just in the hopes someone comes in and buys it,” she said. Success!

The Trump administration believes a renewed emphasis on biosecurity can help in the battle against bird flu and ease egg prices. The Agriculture Department predicts the current record prices are going to get much worse this year. It’s also not clear how much more farmers can do to keep the virus out. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins offered the first new details about her bird flu plan Wednesday.
