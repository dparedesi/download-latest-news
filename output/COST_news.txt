Note: Costco FY’24 ended on September 1, 2024. RICHMOND, CALIFORNIA - JULY 11: In an aerial view, the Costco logo is displayed on the exterior of a ... [+] Costco store on July 11, 2024 in Richmond, California. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Warehouse club operator Costco (NASDAQ: COST) stock is up 52% since the beginning of this year, almost 2x the return of the S&P 500 over the same period. In comparison, Costco’s peer Walmart’s (NYSE: WMT) stock has swelled about 80% over the same period. Another competitor is having a good year, too. See What’s Happening With Amazon Stock? So what’s happening with Costco stock? Costco reported earnings and intraday (Dec. 13) is up 1.5% near $1000 per share. Costco beat both on top and bottom lines in its fiscal first quarter, which ended November 24. The retailer reported $4.04 (up 13% year-over-year) in earnings per share on $62.15 billion (up 8% y-o-y) in revenue. The market was anticipating $3.79 and $62.08 billion, respectively. Comparable sales for the total company (and U.S.) increased 5.2% y-o-y. Traffic rose 5.1% globally and 4.9% in the U.S. In addition, the company’s average ticket was up 0.1% worldwide and 0.3% in the U.S., including the negative impact of gas deflation and foreign exchange rates. Costco has shown a consistent performance at driving revenue, coupled with its dedication to enhancing customer experience, reflecting its ability to thrive in the ever-changing retail landscape. Several club stores have been opened in the U.S. and the company is well-positioned for continued growth overseas, including in China. Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. Despite the pandemic and inflationary pressures, the business has grown strongly. It should be noted that Costco makes a majority of its profits from its membership income, so comparable sales growth isn’t as important for it as it is for other retailers. In Q1, membership fee income of $1.2 billion was 8% higher than the prior-year period. This quarter marked the full impact of the 8.3% fee increase which took place on September 1, 2024. The cost of a premium membership increased to $130 from $120 and the maximum annual 2% reward for its executive membership rose to $1,250 from $1,000. Also, the annual charge for its basic membership fee grew to $65 from $60. Costco usually increases its membership fees every five years and the last hike was seen in 2017. Inflation over the past two years may have contributed to the seven-year gap this time. Admirably, COST stock has generated better returns than the broader market in each of the last 3 years Returns for the stock were 52% in 2021, -19% in 2022, and 49% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. The retailer ended the first quarter with 77.4 million paid household members, up 8% y-o-y, and 139 million cardholders, up 7%, with continuing growth throughout the previous quarters. In terms of renewal rates, at the Q1 end, its U.S. and Canada renewal rates were 92.8%, down 0.1% from the Q4 end. The worldwide rate came in at 90.4%, also down 0.1%. The company’s renewal rates are seeing some impact from higher growth in digital sign-ups, which renew at a slightly lower rate than the base as a whole. A high renewal rate not only ensures a steady stream of revenue from membership fees but also increases the lifetime value of each customer, thereby boosting overall profitability. We need to monitor this metric when calculating Costco’s long-term growth potential. We have revised COST’s valuation to $973 per share, based on a $18.07 expected EPS and a 53.9x P/E multiple for the fiscal year 2025 - slightly below the current market price. We forecast COST’s Revenues to be around $273 billion for the fiscal year 2025, up 7% y-o-y. The stock’s current valuation at 54 times earnings is much higher than the 25 to 30 P/E range before the pandemic, which means investors could see a couple of scenarios play out. There is the possibility that the shares could decline until the valuation falls in line, especially if a recession sinks the broader stock market. Alternatively, the stock may oscillate as earnings grow and valuations catch up. High inflationary pressures on food still burden consumers, so retail companies like Costco will benefit as cost savings are passed to customers. Costco also began selling gold in August 2023 and silver in late January of this year. The company prices the product attractively, providing members gold at ~2% above spot prices before a 2% cash back reward for executive members and another 2% cash back for those with the Citi card. It is also helpful to see how its peers stack up. Check out how COST’s Peers fare on metrics that matter. You will find other valuable comparisons for companies across industries at Peer Comparisons.

SEBI comments on retail participation in algo trading SEBI to review, refine framework on algorithmic trading by retail SEBI: Broker to provide algo trading after exchange permission Sensex and Nifty rebound: Market recovers despite broad-based volatility The Sensex and Nifty fully recovered today after the steep intraday fall, reflecting broad-based volatility across the market. Overvaluation concerns relative to global peers, coupled with disappointing corporate earnings, have further spurred FII outflows. On Thursday, FIIs sold Rs.3,560.01 worth of equities which marks the continuation of the profit booking. The Indian rupee touched an all-time low against the US dollar on Thursday, driven by persistent foreign investor-led sell-offs in equities and a rise in onshore forward premiums, contributing to significant downward pressure on the currency. The trend aligns with global factors such as the strength of the US dollar, supported by robust U.S. economic data and recent election outcomes. Domestically, inflation remains a key worry. India’s Consumer Price Index (CPI)-based inflation came at 5.5% in November, within the RBI’s target. But, constant elevated food prices, raise concerns about potential delays in interest rate cuts by the RBI. All these factors collectively contribute to heightened market volatility, leading to inconsistent intraday trends with sudden fluctuations, which have made it difficult for traders to predict market movements and generate intraday profits.

Most every Saturday morning, Bob Snow slips on a short sleeve fishing shirt and khakis and ­putters out to his garage, a former airplane hangar within sight of the historic Rivanna River. “Thomas Jefferson used to cross right over there,” the Troy, Va., resident says, pointing across a wide field to a distant bank. Snow is 83. His white hair is close-cropped, and his smile is constant. He hums a lot. You’d be hard-pressed to find a more unlikely hardcore prepper anywhere in America. But inside the hangar, which serves as the warehouse for an organization called East Coast Preppers, Snow’s obsession becomes clear. Sturdy metal shelves fill its 7,000 square feet. They’re stocked floor to ceiling with backpacks, skillets, latex gloves, and binoculars. Freeze-dried celery, blueberries, oranges, and mango. Powdered eggs, powdered peanut butter. Portable showers and commodes. And everything is for sale. An anomaly? Hardly. Harsh pandemic realities brought doomsday into the daylight and put a sudden stamp of social approval on prepping. Today, it’s believed some 23 million adults in the United States are stockpiling their pantries and upping their survival skills. It’s big business, too, with billions spent annually on portable generators, gas masks, and windup radios. Some preppers are motivated by pragmatism and common sense, but others do a 180 into apocalyptic fear, fueled by a consuming zeal to protect themselves and their families. Christians are not immune from the hype. Depending on their eschatology, some foresee a coming calamity. Others question the desire to preserve what we have on earth when something much better awaits. By 10 o’clock at Snow’s place, more than 20 customers arrive with emptied car trunks ready for bulk buys. They’ve signed up for a class, too. This morning, it’s “Advanced Prepping.” Men and women, mostly over age 60, plop down in plastic lawn chairs set up in a room where three large dehydrator machines stand against one wall. As the crowd samples a salad made with freeze-dried chicken, a photo of then-President Joe Biden grins from a nearby dartboard. A sign on the wall says, “We now accept cash, gold, and silver.” Snow, standing at the front, starts the class by holding up a copy of One Second After, a popular novel about an unexpected electromagnetic pulse attack, or EMP. In the book, every modern electrical device is disabled, and the United States is effectively returned to the 19th century. Some in the crowd have read it. Others want to. They run the gamut, these preppers, from a grandma on her way to a soccer game, to a country singer hopeful on his way to Nashville. But they all seem to see eye to eye about one thing—­disaster is coming, and it’s high time to prepare. One woman, who only gives me her first name, Joyce, confides that she has a “room of doom” at her house. She keeps it supplied with canned goods, candles, whatever it would take to get through a long-term emergency. “I’ve been doing this for decades,” she admits sheepishly, going on to extol the virtues of rain barrels. In the back row, Jack, another cautious type who won’t give out his last name, says he’s unhappy with the country’s direction. That’s why he never misses one of these free weekend classes. He’s even taught his 10-year-old son how to sanitize water. But that’s nothing compared with a lady to his left. She quips that she recently cashed in her 401(k) and put it in precious metals. The surprising thing? No one within earshot even bats an eye. Bob Snow (right) and Gary Woodson take stock of the inventory at the East Coast Preppers warehouse. Photo by Kim Henderson TODAY’S PREPPER MOVEMENT traces its heritage to the Cold War of the 1950s, when the threat of atomic attack had schools conducting “duck and cover” drills, and families built bomb shelters in their backyards. During the Eisenhower administration, authorities even urged families to maintain a seven-day supply of food and water. They named the initiative “Grandma’s Pantry,” stressing that grandmas are always ready for emergencies. In the early ’60s, President John F. Kennedy upped the ante by calling for more than $200 million to construct public fallout shelters. The Department of Agriculture got busy, too. The result was a contribution to the doomsday diet—a bulgur wheat biscuit dubbed the “All-Purpose Survival Cracker.” Over the next decades, terms like retreater and survivalist entered the vocabulary. A survivalist honed pioneer skills and anticipated a combative style of preparedness. A retreater, in contrast, tried to avoid conflict and become invisible. As interest in survivalism grew during the 1980s, books and expos for its adherents became a multibillion-­dollar industry. Prepping took a hit when the scare over Y2K turned out to be false, but it wasn’t long before the terrorist attacks of 9/11 prompted authorities to instruct citizens to stockpile duct tape and have an evacuation plan. Hurricane Katrina, which left thousands of people without access to resources and supplies, furthered the cause. That was 2005. Five years later, polls showed half of all Americans had preparedness on the brain—a nearly 20% increase from pre-Katrina years. During that time period, Bob Snow was newly retired and spending time in Utah. As a Mormon, he was already steeped in preparedness. It’s part of a religious ideology that exalts being “anxiously engaged in a positive program of preparation.” In Utah, Snow saw the Mormon network of home storage centers and canneries. He visited prepper stores with their heirloom seed and water filtration systems. He determined his community back home in Virginia needed something similar. With his wife’s blessing, Snow cashed in a $30,000 life insurance policy and hauled two tractor trailers filled with survival goods across the country. East Coast Preppers was born. Shoppers in the warehouse today probably don’t know that history. No clues of a Latter-day Saints connection mark the aisles they’re cruising. Class is over, and some participants are looking for the new MadiDrop that Snow promoted. It’s a ceramic tablet that can treat up to 20 liters of water a day for 12 months, a utility he described as “revolutionary.” Snow is seated behind a table where his laptop is open and acting as a cash register. Business is steady. A regular he knows by name rolls up with three full shopping carts. In a matter of minutes, she shells out more than $1,000 for “supplies.” Prepping isn’t cheap. Americans spent an estimated $11 billion on emergency preparedness in 2022, and not just on the basics. They bought things like steel shelters, too. Texas builder Rising S Bunkers, which incorporates three crosses into its logo, is one of the best known in the business. Its 8-by-12 bunker starts at $50,900. A decontamination room costs $29,000 extra. Now that prepping is no longer shorthand for paranoia, big names like Walmart, Amazon, and Costco are jockeying for a share of the market, too. Costco’s one-month emergency food supply buckets are available by the pallet for $6,000, but you can’t accuse them of price gouging. That’s almost 14,000 just-add-water meals for less than 50 cents each. Pastor Tim Kinnard on his homestead in Sherwood, Ark., with a wood supply for the winter. Photo by Kim Henderson IN EARLIER TIMES, preparedness was a necessity, but prepping today is as much personal philosophy as emergency management. That personal philosophy usually includes strong views about self-sustainability, the kind that are in line with environmentalists on matters like rainwater harvesting and alternative energy. Preppers are also into gardening and canning, pursuits popular with millennials. But the prepper movement rarely gets linked to either of those groups. Instead, stereotypical preppers are considered too right wing and conservative, and they feel strongly about gun ownership. Or at least we think they do. There’s a secretive element that makes preppers hard to categorize and even harder to count. But since the pandemic, traffic to prepper websites and online communities has exploded, with some YouTube prepper channels boasting more than a million subscribers. Of course, the more sensational the episode titles—“You Have Been Warned,” “Get Your Money Out Now,” “We Won’t Survive This”—the more monetized the content creator. That’s where fear-mongering festers, and prepping becomes an identity instead of an activity. Although some Christian preppers embrace that apocalyptic vision, others forgo the fear. They just want to be prepared to help themselves—and others—when tough times come. Pastor Tim Kinnard lives just north of Little Rock, Ark., a state where the climate and cost of living, as well as less government regulation, have attracted an influx of preppers. One day a stranger knocked on his door. “He said they were moving from a more liberal context, a trend I’ve heard called the ‘Blue State Exodus,’” Kinnard recalls. “He wanted my advice on a good place to settle.” The man knew Kinnard from his online lectures and podcasts related to homesteading. That label—homesteader—is one Kinnard is more comfortable wearing than prepper, though his family is more prepared than most. His wife grows medicinal herbs, and his five children help raise pigs. Snap beans are ready in the garden. Their home, a Dutch Colonial, is extra-insulated and designed for good ventilation. Kinnard says their lifestyle is more about self-­reliance than stockpiling. A collected, rather than calamitous, approach. “Common, everyday preparedness is a wise thing, but what we know as ‘doomsday prepping’ isn’t Biblical unless what we mean by that is we’re preparing to meet the Lord Himself, and we are preparing others to be ready to meet the Lord, too,” Kinnard reasons. “That’s my pushback to the stockpiling-to-survive-the-end-of-the-world flavor of prepping, which many Christians are into.” And while Kinnard expresses dismay at preppers profiting from Armageddon announcements, he says he doesn’t trust the mainstream media to tell him everything that’s happening either. Instead, he tunes in on his ham radio and subscribes to specific podcasts and YouTube channels to hear reports from everyday people. “Whatever narrative you hear on the news isn’t necessarily what’s really going on,” Kinnard says. “So having free agents out there doing the same thing, telling us what’s really going on, we need that. But the motivation needs to be the facts, not ‘here’s a spin of those facts so I can get a couple extra dollars.’” Mark and Krista Lawley are part of the prepping set Kinnard considers non-alarmist. Since 2020, they’ve aired more than 470 episodes of their “Practical Prepping” podcast, all produced inside their North Alabama home recording studio. Some of their most popular include: “Items Preppers Should Carry Every Day,” “Eight Uses for Hydrogen Peroxide,” and “What Moms Need To Know About Home Invasions.” The Lawleys started their podcast after a trip to the grocery store during COVID-19. For the first time in her life, 62-year-old Krista was standing in front of empty store shelves. “I thought to myself, ‘This is Russia. We’ve got the money to spend and nothing to buy with it,’” she remembers. Both she and Mark have long believed in keeping their pantry full and their tools handy. His understanding grew while he was involved with the Birmingham Metro Baptist Association’s disaster relief team. During some of its missions, he saw tornado victims desperate for food. Many had only a few days’ worth on hand. “And the younger they are, the less they prepare,” Krista interjects, shaking her head. She says dependence on DoorDash and Instacart has trained a generation to think only of today. “These people don’t even have a can of soda in their refrigerator.” Each episode of the Lawleys’ podcast begins with a promise: no bunkers, no zombies, no alien invasions. They point out that a lot of people are prepping for postapocalyptic, total-grid-down societal collapse. Not them. “We don’t want to survive that,” Mark clarifies, a hint of a smile hiding behind his mustache. He adds that much depends on your eschatology. “Some Christian preppers think that the Church is going to go through the tribulation, but I believe the rapture is going to occur before the tribulation. What we prepare for are the practical things that happen to everyday people.” Pastor Tim Kinnard with herbs from the family garden. Photo by Kim Henderson IN ESSENCE, the Lawleys preach planning, and their message resonates with thousands of podcast listeners who, after COVID’s unrest and mandates, no longer trust in the government’s institutions to deliver in a crisis. Mark and Krista are members of a local faith-based prepping group born of a Sunday school class discussion. Members meet monthly and share their skills. Medical practitioners, lawyers, farmers, weapons experts, cattlemen. Some property owners simply offer space. “If disaster strikes and you need to get out of your urban setting, because it’s probably the most dangerous place you could be, they are offering a safe haven,” Krista explains. In contrast, she admits some preppers strive to lie low. They fear the world will beat a path to their door after a disaster and take what they’ve painstakingly stored. Krista is not for that attitude. “I think the Christian perspective is, we’re here for others.” When the Lawleys launched a private “Practical Prepping” Facebook group in January, it attracted nearly 25,000 members in just a few months. Although they enlisted help to moderate posts, they still spend about an hour each day responding to questions from fellow preppers around the world. Some countries have government-backed preparedness initiatives. In Sweden, prepping is viewed as a form of social responsibility, rather than an eccentric hobby. Students are taught essential survival skills and the importance of self-sufficiency. That’s been Bob Snow’s mission with East Coast Preppers for nearly two decades. At his age, though, tall shelves are hard to stock, and heavy equipment is a pain to unload. In May, he announced his retirement. His email to the East Coast Preppers community was short and to the point: He’s tired. But a paragraph near the end provided an additional tidbit. Until their warehouse doors close for good, weekly sales will continue to soar. Meanwhile, there’s an urgency in Snow’s voice as he tells his Saturday crowd that something significant happened the day before. The price of gold rose $60 an ounce. Then, almost as quickly, it went back down. He’s right. It was a record high at the time. But for a hundred years gold prices have fluctuated for all sorts of reasons—inflation, rising geopolitical tension, the amount of reserves, the cost of mining—with large swings in both directions. Still, Snow sees the recent spike as a sign of something worse coming. He definitely has the crowd’s attention, and he’s very convincing. “That just doesn’t happen,” he declares in an understated way, his eyes widening at the thought. “It was a red flag to me.” If you enjoyed this article and would like to support WORLD's brand of Biblically sound journalism, click here.

Title: Kroger and Albertsons are spending billions to reward shareholders after their blocked merger

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Within a day of their $25 billion merger’s falling apart in court, Kroger and Albertsons were each planning to move forward with share repurchases to boost their stock prices and reward investors. America’s two largest grocery store operators had argued that they’d be better able to lower prices for shoppers by joining forces. Doing so, they said, would boost their negotiating power with suppliers and make it easier to take on much bigger retailers that compete with them in grocery sales, such as Walmart, Costco and Amazon. The Biden administration disagreed, with the Federal Trade Commission saying in a lawsuit countering the merger that the deal threatened to drive down workers’ wages and bargaining power and reduce industry competition, potentially pushing food prices higher. With the deal now dead, it’s impossible to know whether any of that would have happened. But U.S. District Judge Adrienne Nelson of Oregon sounded a note of skepticism, writing in her decision Tuesday that the chains’ promises to invest in lower prices were “neither merger-specific nor verifiable, so there is no guarantee” that shoppers would benefit. “The promise to make a price investment is not legally binding, and the Court must give limited weight to a non-binding promise made during these proceedings,” she said. A Superior Court judge in Seattle agreed with Nelson’s ruling and issued an injunction against the merger Tuesday. On Wednesday, Albertsons terminated the deal and sued Kroger, alleging its erstwhile partner didn’t do enough to secure regulators’ blessing. The drama unfolded just as the federal government released new inflation data for November showing grocery prices continue to inch higher. The costs of food eaten at home were 1.6% higher last month than they were the same time last year — a smaller uptick than the 2.7% annual inflation rate overall but accelerating 0.5% from the previous month after a 0.1% rise from September to October. Food prices tend to be volatile, but a broad range of items from produce to poultry notched increases in a wholesale inflation report that came in hotter than expected Thursday. Kroger on Wednesday reiterated its “commitment to lower prices,” saying it has invested billions in cost reductions over the past two decades. The chain also said it has spent $2.4 billion on pay hikes since 2018 and up to $3.8 billion in annual store improvements. Albertsons similarly promised to stay focused on “improving our value proposition with customers.” Neither company offered more details about their price-cutting plans, and Albertsons declined to comment further. Kroger said only that it provides value to customers “through competitive pricing, loyalty discounts, personalized offers, fuel rewards and a unique private label portfolio.” At the same time, both grocery chains said this week that they’d be pouring billions of dollars into moves that will benefit their shareholders. Kroger said it would repurchase $7.5 billion of its shares after a more than two-year pause, with $5 billion of that to be repurchased in an accelerated fashion — the same sum that Kroger estimated Wednesday it has spent to lowering prices over the past 21 years. Albertsons said it would repurchase $2 billion of its shares and increase the dividend it pays to owners of its stock by 25%. Stock repurchases — which reduce the number of shares available, driving up the value of those that remain — and dividend payments benefit all investors but especially those with the biggest stakes. Top shareholders typically include large Wall Street firms with the financial firepower to buy and hold millions of shares of publicly traded companies. Wall Street investment firm Cerberus Capital Management is by far the largest shareholder in Albertsons, followed by the Vanguard Group, which is the country’s largest mutual fund provider, and BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, with over $11.5 trillion under its supervision. Vanguard, BlackRock and billionaire investor Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate are the top owners of Kroger shares. “With both of these companies, there was a lot of hope [put] into the merger — that it was a way of generating growth. Those things aren’t happening now,” said Neil Saunders, managing director of the retail consultancy GlobalData. Repurchasing shares could help inject more “optimistic sentiment” among investors, effectively reassuring them “‘we’ll generate good returns for you,’” he said. Kroger’s stock has been trading roughly 3% higher since Wednesday, while Albertsons’ had clawed back roughly all its losses following the ruling by late Thursday. In the meantime, consumer groups and labor advocates are hailing the blocked merger as a victory for shoppers and workers and as a vindication of the Biden administration’s antitrust efforts during its final weeks in office. The judges in the case “correctly saw the merger as a huge threat to the jobs and benefits of thousands of their members working for those chains and the communities in which they live,” said Seth Harris, a law and policy professor at Northeastern University and a former top labor adviser in the Biden White House. Thomas Gremillion, director of food policy at the Consumer Federation of America, said, “Combining two of the four largest food retailers would have also reduced consumer choice, leading to fewer alternatives to low-quality, ultra-processed foods.” “Unfortunately, the Trump administration seems unlikely to build on this important step towards restoring competition in food retail,” Gremillion said, citing President-elect Donald Trump’s selection of Andrew Ferguson to replace Lina Khan atop the FTC. That’s a sign that “Big Food will only be getting bigger over the next four years,” he predicted. In a September campaign stop at a grocery store in Kittanning, Pennsylvania, Trump slammed the Biden-Harris administration over the costs of everything from eggs and cereal to ground beef. “Bacon is through the roof,” he said. Trump said Thursday at the New York Stock Exchange that increasing oil and natural gas drilling would help lower inflation, including for food prices, a promise energy analysts have viewed skeptically. But in a Time magazine profile published Thursday, he said of groceries: “It’s hard to bring things down once they’re up. You know, it’s very hard.” CORRECTION (Dec. 13, 8:40 a.m. ET): A previous version of this article misidentified Kroger’s and Albertsons’ largest shareholders.

Costco (COST+1.38%) reported better-than-expected earnings on Thursday, fueled by solid revenue growth, strong e-commerce performance, and increased membership fees. The results extend a strong year for the retailer, whose shares have climbed nearly 50% in 2023, compared to the S&P 500's 27% gain. The stock closed at $988.39. The company beat Wall Street’s expectations. The retailer reported revenue of $62.15 billion, about $4.04 earnings per share. Analysts had forecast revenue of $61.98 billion, approximately $3.79 earnings per share. Membership fees also saw an increase, reaching $1.17 billion, up from $1.08 billion the previous year. Earlier this year, Costco announced a “Netflix-Style” crackdown on its membership and said it would raise the price of its Gold Star membership to $65 – a $5 bump that marked the first price hike since 2017. To offset the increase for new members, the company offered a special promotion in November for a one-year Gold Star Membership that came with a $45 Costco Shop Card. Executives said during the company’s earnings call on Dec. 12 that online sales were primarily driven by shoppers buying items like furniture, sporting goods, and hardware in bulk. E-commerce sales rose 13% when compared to the previous year, fueled in part by partnerships with Uber (UBER+1.01%) and Instacart. These partnerships have allowed customers to quickly purchase items – such as a blender – at a lower cost and have them delivered faster. Earlier this month, Costco recalled its store-branded Kirkland Signature organic eggs due to a potential salmonella contamination. The bacteria can cause serious infections, including stomach cramps and diarrhea, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Additionally, the company reported a 15% decline in e-commerce sales the month prior, which it said was due to holiday shopping being delayed by a week compared to typical patterns. During that time, Costco pulled nearly 80,000 pounds of its store-branded butter after it was found to be missing a crucial allergy warning.

Title: Raise a glass: A lot of top-shelf booze is more affordable this holiday season

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Booze will cost you more this holiday season than last — but not much more. And there are ways to increase the bang for your buck while grabbing a round of drinks or bringing a bottle to a gathering. As is usually the case, alcohol is still generally cheaper at home than in bars and restaurants, and beer remains lower-priced than many liquors. But some spirits, including many tequilas and whiskeys, are seeing noteworthy price drops that have made even top-shelf bottles a bit more affordable. Whiskey bought for at-home consumption is nearly 2% less expensive, on average, than a year ago, federal inflation numbers released Wednesday show. Beer served out of the house, on the other hand, is about 4% pricer. And on Thursday, federal regulators turned a spotlight on retail booze prices, accusing a major U.S. liquor distributor of favoring big chains like Costco and Kroger over independent shops, making it harder for smaller operators to compete. So far, at any rate, many price moves for alcoholic beverages have been relatively modest. Booze costs rose nearly 15% from the first half of 2019 to the first half of this year, less than the 23% jump in consumer prices at large during that period. As of last month, alcohol costs were up only 1.8% since the year before, while inflation overall was 2.7%. You can really find good-quality product at a lower price. Often it’s better than the stuff you’re paying more for. Marten Lodewijks, president of IWSR U.S. Sluggish demand has helped keep prices in check. “It’s been a pretty rough year for alcohol sales,” said Marten Lodewijks, president of the U.S. division of the beverage industry data firm IWSR. “It’s been fairly consistent across the board: a general pulling back of consumer spend on alcohol, and spirits in particular.” That trend coincides with a broader caution rippling through the economy. Retail sales around Thanksgiving showed many households are still eager to spend, but only at the right price. Many brands are chasing value-wary shoppers’ wallets with increasingly competitive deals and discounts. “As a nonessential item, it hit consumers quite hard,” Lodewijks said of inflation’s impact on alcohol in recent years. “When prices on everything else started going up, suddenly that extra $5 on a bottle of spirits was meaningful.” His firm flagged in September that sales volumes had declined more than expected during the first seven months of this year for beer, wine and spirits alike; the only exception was in canned cocktails, which beverage makers have been pushing heavily. The falloffs came amid growing interest in nonalcoholic mocktails and signs that younger people are thinking twice about causal drinking. Shares of Diageo, a major importer of Scottish whiskey, and Pernod Ricard, which imports Absolut Vodka and Jameson whiskey, are each down by double digits since the start of this year. U.S. beer sales have also suffered, squeezing brewers who have faced a yearslong pullback after the previous decade’s craft beer boom. Even so, beer remains the cheapest and by far the most popular alcohol at full-service restaurants, accounting for over half of booze sales in those settings this year, according to data released Tuesday by the transaction processor Toast. Typically, weaker sales encourage price cuts, but this week’s inflation data showed beer at bars and restaurants posting the biggest jump — climbing 4% between November 2023 and last month. Lodewijks said at least two factors are likely at play: Many brewers have been passing on higher costs to their customers and chasing higher-dollar drinkers. “While mainstream and below beer has seen major volume losses, premium and above beer has generally fared very well,” he said. “Now, consumers won’t be fooled into thinking a mainstream beer is premium simply by raising prices, but this could be an attempt by some brand owners to change the perception of their brand by moving it up the price ladder.” There are still big unknowns when it comes to brewers’ costs. President-elect Donald Trump’s victory in November led some beer makers to voice fresh worries about tariffs, after his first round hit the aluminum and steel-reliant industry in 2018. Even Modelo importer Constellation Brands, which had waved off trade concerns before the election, saw its stock fall 3.5% after Trump proposed 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico last month, before shares steadied. In the meantime, some of the industry’s headwinds since its pandemic-era boom are still benefiting consumers this holiday season. The price of agave, a key ingredient in tequila and mezcal, has fallen dramatically since 2022, when it peaked at 32 Mexican pesos per kilogram, or about $1.60. By February 2024, 1 kilogram of agave cost just 5 Mexican pesos, or less than 30 cents. Tequila manufacturers took advantage as demand soared, producing trendy luxury tequilas — many of them at lower prices. That has made it easier to buy a high-quality bottle in recent years without spending more, Lodewijks said. “What consumers are saying is, ‘I’m not going to spend $50, but spending $30, I can get a really good tequila for that price,’” he said. Tequila is still the priciest liquor you can order at a sit-down restaurant, averaging $13.48 per drink as of the third quarter, the Toast data shows. But it’s the only booze whose costs have remained basically flat for the past year. Premium bourbons have propped up the U.S. whiskey industry, which is relatively strong at the moment even as Scottish and other imported options struggle, Lodewijks said. Still, whiskey was the only at-home alcoholic beverage to see prices outright decline since last year, inflation data shows. Whiskey distillers have seen softer demand in key markets like California, Florida and Kentucky, according to IWSR. But Lodewijks said it could be that producers have managed to lower their costs through more efficient production. “Shop around and do your research, and you can really find good-quality product at a lower price,” he advised holiday quaffers and bottle-gifters. “Often it’s better than the stuff you’re paying more for.” Alexandra Byrne is an intern with the NBC News Business and Economy Unit. © 2024 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Title: Costco is expected to post another quarter of growth against an uncertain consumer environment

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Costco (COST) is set to report its fiscal first quarter results as inflationary-weary shoppers turn to the wholesale retailer. Adjusted earnings per share are expected to come in at $3.81, per Bloomberg consensus estimates. Revenue is expected to come in at $62.14 billion. Same-store sales, excluding fuel, are expected to grow 6.26%, boosted by its international business, followed by the US and Canada. The company is projected to clock higher foot traffic in the quarter, up 6.87% compared to a year ago. But Wall Street expects transaction growth to decline 0.40%. Year to date, Costco stock is up more than 50%, outpacing the 27% gain for the S&P 500 (^GSPC). Here's what Wall Street expects Costco to report for its fiscal first quarter, which ended Dec. 4, 2024, compared to the previous year's fiscal first quarter results: Revenue: $62.14 billion versus $57.8 billion last year Adjusted earnings per share: $3.81 versus $3.58 Total company comparable sales growth, excluding fuel: 6.26% versus 3.9% US same-store sales growth: 6.14% versus 2.6% Canada same-store sales growth: 5.68% versus 8.2% Other international sales growth: 7.08% versus 7.1% E-commerce growth: 14.1% versus 6.3% Membership fee revenue: $1.17 billion versus $1.08 billion On Sept. 1, Costco hiked the price of its Gold Star membership by $5 to $65 and the price of its Executive membership by $10 to $130. Wall Street expects the hike to be reflected in this quarter's results. It was the first time the company hiked its membership fees since 2017, and Costco said it delayed the increase until the team felt like inflation started to dissipate and consumers' spending power returned. As of the previous quarter, the change is expected to impact around 52 million memberships, a little over half of which are Executive memberships. The fee hike is expected to grow membership income by high single digits to low double digits. Membership fee income is expected to come in at $1.17 billion, more than the $1.08 billion reported last year. The company also doubled down on scanning membership cards at the door, which CEO Ron Vachris said allowed operators to know real-time foot traffic and prompt customers to renew memberships. "Membership growth remains healthy as consumers seek value and existing members continue to trade up to the Executive membership level," Joseph Feldman of Telsey Advisory Group wrote in a note to clients. Costco operates 891 warehouses worldwide as of last quarter. Wall Street expects that to grow to 895. Its e-commerce business is also expected to have another stellar quarter, up 14.1%. Sales in the previous quarter were powered by growth in appliances, tires, toys, gift cards, and food, health, and beauty aids, among other items like gold bars. Oppenheimer analyst Rupesh Parikh called Costco a "Top Pick." "We continue to see a strong outlook for market share gains and believe Costco is well positioned to sustain robust top-line momentum," he wrote in a note to clients, adding that it continues to step up efforts around general merchandise "from a powerful gift card offering to newer premium brands." He believes a stock split could be in the future. Shares are currently hovering around $1,000 per share. — Brooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Title: Why The Kroger-Albertsons Merger Was Blocked

Atlanta, Georgia, Kroger. (Photo by: Jeffrey Greenberg/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) A Federal Judge and a King County Judge in Washington state have blocked the $25 billion merger of grocery giants Kroger and Albertsons. The decision is a victory for consumers, grocery workers, smaller-scale suppliers and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The FTC successfully argued that the merger would raise prices by eliminating competition and weaken union bargaining power. Kroger and Albertsons countered that they needed to merge to compete with Walmart, Costco and Amazon, and that selling off 579 stores would preserve competition after the merger. The resulting grocery behemoth would have over 5,000 stores. The two companies spent close to $1 billion to push the merger through, money that maybe could have instead gone towards lowering grocery prices. The Institute for Local Self Reliance, which opposed the merger, stated, “This historic ruling marks the first time that the government has blocked a supermarket merger in decades. It shows that the administration's push to reinvigorate our antitrust laws is succeeding, including, crucially, in the courts.” A group of UFCW local unions (UFCW 7, 324, 400, 770, 1564 and 3000) leading the Stop the Merger coalition, also put out a statement, “The well-reasoned decisions today by both Courts make plain what union grocery workers have known all along – this mega-merger would be bad for workers who deserve a workplace where they can be paid well for their labor, be safe and be respected. It would be disastrous for shoppers who deserve competition that leads to better choices and lower prices. The merger would be detrimental to our communities, would harm farmers and suppliers who deserve a healthy balance to negotiate fair prices for their hard work.” The top 6 chains control 65% of grocery retail sales nationally, the top 4 over 50%. Walmart alone controls nearly 30% nationally and over 50% in many regions. Kroger and Albertsons own dozens of regional banners that millions of people shop in daily. Kroger owns Fred Meyer, QFC, Harris Teeter, Vitacost, Smith’s, Ralph’s and King Soopers, and others, while Albertsons owns Jewel-Osco, Safeway, Vons, Pavilion, Acme, King’s, Shaw’s, Tom Thumb and Randalls and others. LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - AUGUST 26: The Albertsons logo is displayed at an Albertsons supermarket ... [+] on August 26, 2024 in Los Angeles, California. A federal judge in Oregon is hearing arguments today after the Federal Trade Commission and several states sued to block the planned merger between grocery chains Kroger and Albertsons. (Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images) Kroger or Albertsons are the No.1, 2 or 3 market share leader in almost every metro area they operate in, such as: This retail consolidation among a handful of chains enables concentration further back in the supply chain, especially in CPG, or consumer packaged goods. The top 4 yogurt companies, including Danone, Lactalis and Chobani, control 75% of sales and the top 3 cereal companies, including General Mills, Post and Kellogg’s, control 90% of your crunchy breakfast options. Four or fewer corporations also control 93% of soda sales, including Coke and Pepsi, 80% of candy, such as Hershey, Mondelez and Mars, 60% of snack bars, including Mars, Kellanova and General Mills, 66% of frozen pizza, 60% of bread, 80% of toothpaste and 80% of toilet paper sales. Such retail and CPG concentration supercharged the price inflation that in turn created windfall profits from 2020-2022. Inflation was not demand-driven, as some economists have suggested. Overall grocery prices are up over 30%, while unit volumes are actually flat or down since 2019: The Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine created ample consumer concerns to give cover fire for companies up and down the supply chain to pass prices to consumers above the rate of their own cost inflation. These practices, called “sellers inflation” by economist Isabella Weber, may have contributed to over 50% of all food price inflation from 2020-2022. In that timeframe, Walmart raised prices on thousands of items well above the rate of inflation, including potato chips by 35%, cookies by 62% and yogurt by 92%. Prices at Albertsons on store brand oils increased by 117%, potato chips by 68% and packaged cheese by 125%. MILL VALLEY, CALIFORNIA - JULY 27: Customers leave a Safeway. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty ... [+] Images) Kroger, Albertsons, Target and Dollar General all saw double-digit net income growth from 2020-2021. In 2020, Walmart and Kroger saw windfall profits as the economy shut down, adding $45 billion to the Walton family wealth and 2 billion dollar rounds of Kroger stock buybacks. During the Kroger-Albertsons merger trials, lots of information was revealed to add fuel to these concerns, as documented by Laurel Kilgour of the American Economic Liberties Project: Lina Khan meme. Blocking such an enormous merger is a brief victory for antitrust and labor advocates. It is a small step considering the challenges for the grocery industry beyond market concentration and higher prices, such as bird flu, climate change, the huge cost externalities from unhealthy food, as well as poverty wages and retail food deserts. Instead, the future could be a grocery industry with diversified ownership and governance, that prioritizes worker welfare and their standards of living, and that reflects a true cost accounting, transitioning towards diversified, regenerative and organic production. Such a sustainable and economic populism should not just be wishful thinking. Like blocking such massive grocery mergers, it should be common sense. One Community. Many Voices.
