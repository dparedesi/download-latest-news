Let's get this out of the way from the jump — it's always best to avoid panic-buying and be strategic when making purchases. But to get a sense of how people are weighing their spending right now, we asked reporters and editors across BI's newsroom to tell us what they're choosing to purchase right now — or why they're holding off — ahead of Donald Trump's latest round of tariffs. For some, potential price hikes on consumer electronics out of China were the tipping point to pull the trigger on a gadget. Others purchased some extra daily consumables or said they were considering a similar move. And some said their spending habits remain unchanged. Let's dive in: Chief correspondent Peter Kafka: On Thursday, instead of checking out my 401(k), I bought a new MacBook Air from Apple, on their website. I have an Apple Card, so I was able to finance it at 0% APR. It's possible Tim Cook will figure out how to get Donald Trump to exempt Apple from tariffs like he did the first time around. Maybe he won't. But either way my kid will need a new computer in the next few months, so I figured I should get one now. I don't know when I'll look at my 401(k), though. Editor Conz Preti: My husband and I are also stocking up on shelf-stable foods. With three kids who rip through food every week, we are keeping our pantry stocked with pasta, canned food, and baking supplies. For veggies, we are planting as much as we can (tomatoes, kale, lettuce, cucumber, peas, carrots) in our garden to offset some costs of things we can't grow, like berries and bananas that our kids love. Trending reporter Ana Altchek: I will be taking a wait-and-see approach. I don't think it's possible to fully predict the market and prepare for possible price hikes — who knows how individual companies will be impacted and how they'll choose to respond? I definitely don't want to overspend in preparation for something that may or may not happen. Plus, I'd rather pay a little extra for some items I know I need in six months than overspend right now on items I may need. Real estate reporter Alcynna Lloyd: I wear hair extensions and ordered some in case tariffs drive up prices or items stop shipping as they did during COVID-19. The wig and extension industry relies heavily on suppliers from China and other Asia-based countries, and during the pandemic, it was a nightmare to get products. Editor Steven Tweedie: I'm ordering larger bags of cat food than I normally would since I know I'll go through it all, and it'll keep. Otherwise, I'm doing my best to resist using this as an excuse to spend on something I don't actually need, like a new Nvidia Graphics card for my PC — even though I'm guessing I'll end up spending more a year or two from now when I finally do upgrade. Senior retail reporter Alex Bitter: I bought a new trench-digging shovel (made in China) on Thursday and will probably pick up another this weekend. I use them for metal detecting and want a spare or two in case one breaks. In general, though, I'm not stocking up on much. These tariffs cover so many products that it seems like avoiding them entirely will be impossible, especially in the long run. Editor Andy Kiersz: I bought a new gaming laptop in December. I'd been considering upgrading at some point but had originally planned to do so later in 2025. The election and subsequent threat of tariffs spurred the move. I'm actually now somewhat regretting not also replacing my still-functional but definitely showing-its-age iPhone 11. Senior correspondent Katie Notopoulos: On Tuesday evening, I did a last-minute shop for things I thought would be most obviously sensitive to the tariffs — cheap fast-fashion clothing made overseas. I hit up the H&M near the BI office for three polyester shirts and a pack of socks. I placed the Old Navy order that I've had in my cart for two weeks for kids' swimsuits and summer clothes. Finally, in a last moment of panic and extreme dopamine low, I went onto Temu and ordered a few cheap toys for a kid's upcoming birthday. On Wednesday, talking with coworkers about how they had bought new laptops and TVs, a flash of Bad Ideas went through my mind. Did I need a new phone? (No, my iPhone 14 is working just fine.) Computer? (No, mine is working fine.) Surely, electronics will go up in price — perhaps now is the time to get a new Kindle? (No. Stop!) Editor Brad Davis: I'm not buying anything special — and I won't! Will my stubbornness come back to bite me, like when I refused to stock up on masks in March 2020? (I really wished I had bought those masks by April of that year.) Editor Ashley Rodriguez: I'm thinking about stocking up on diapers and wipes. My Costco stashes on both are running low. It's a tough decision because my 7-month-old has been growing so quickly that I worry she'll outgrow the diapers before I have a chance to use them all. Reporter Alice Tecotzky: As a devoted baker, I bought an extra bottle of vanilla Thursday despite still having some left in my pantry. Much of our vanilla comes from Madagascar, which was hit with a 47% tariff, and I anticipate the already pricey product will only get more expensive (and derail my long-awaited summer baking plans). Other than that, I'm not stockpiling too much, both because the economic future seems impossible to predict and because I don't have space in my small Brooklyn apartment. Editor Monica Melton: When my 2020 HP laptop gave up the ghost in February, I promptly handed it over to an e-waste recycling program. Since then, I've been borrowing my husband's MacBook Pro, telling myself I'd do research on the specs and best deal for my next personal computer. While this has taken me months to get around to, given how tariffs will impact the price of consumer electronics, I feel a renewed urgency to get that laptop this weekend. I'll likely choose a refurbished MacBook, which I reckon would hold up better than another HP. The resale market for electronics is looking a lot more appealing these days! Senior correspondent Emily Stewart: I am … not buying anything. Not because I'm not worried about tariffs! But honestly, I do not need anything right now, and I'm trying to fight my consumerist, "What should I buy about this?" tendencies. Obviously, price increases are bad. But I don't think it's bad to take a beat and think about whether I actually need to be drowning in even more stuff, especially as I stare at the robot vacuum I panic-bought during the pandemic that I have used a handful of times and is now broken. Editor Paige DiFiore: Earlier this week, we replaced our dying air fryer — it might've lasted us a few more months but we'd rather buy a new one now before prices could go up. Now, I'm stocking up on household essentials that won't expire, like toilet paper, dishwasher pods, and laundry detergent at BJ's. My fiancé and are I big coffee drinkers, so we just ordered some bags of espresso from our favorite Italian brand — but we can't buy too much because its shelf life is only a few months. I'm very concerned about how expensive coffee could get since it's not something the US produces on a large scale. We're getting married this year, so I'm relieved most of my guests purchased bridal shower gifts before the tariffs were announced. I'd feel bad if items on the list, like small appliances, cost even more than they already do. Editor Leena Rao: On Wednesday afternoon, shortly after the tariffs were announced, my husband went to the Apple Store and bought a new iPhone 16 Pro and a MacBook Pro. These weren't time-sensitive purchases, but given the potential rise in costs of hardware, we wanted to preempt any price increases. We are in the process of leasing a new car (a Volvo) and have one on order that's supposed to arrive in the next two weeks. I don't believe the model of our car is made in the United States. I'm hopeful we won't incur any additional costs for our monthly lease price, but we won't find out until the car arrives and we officially sign the paperwork for the lease. Editor Debbie Strong: I replaced my dishwasher last week and splurged on a slightly fancier model. The motor had broken on our old one, so this was less of a "tariff panic" purchase and more of an "I refuse to hand-wash another dish" emergency buy. Still, I'm relieved at the timing, as dishwashers have been repeatedly flagged as an item about to get way more expensive. I don't have any other plans to stock up on goods, mainly because I don't have the headspace for it right now. We'll see if that changes next time I'm at the grocery store. Jump to

Title: I finally get the Costco hype now that I moved from an apartment to a house. Here are 18 purchases I swear by.

I grew up in New York City and have always lived in small apartments without much storage space. It just never made sense for me to buy groceries in bulk. However, my partner and I recently moved to Los Angeles, and now we have a whole house to ourselves. One of the best perks of our new life is taking monthly trips to Costco for all our favorite items. Here are my favorite things to get there. We tend to have a Costco shopping trip at least once a month, and I also go there about once a week to fuel my car. Gas is expensive, especially in Los Angeles, and Costco typically has unbeatable prices — particularly for premium, which is what my Mini Cooper takes. The best part is I can easily check the rate on a daily basis when using the store's app, which helps me determine if Costco gas prices are better than competitors that day. My partner is a carnivore to the max. To him, nothing beats the five-pack of the Kirkland Signature boneless New York steaks. They taste great on the grill or in a cast-iron pan and are often the star of a delicious weekday meal for us. We never skip out on buying Costco's ribs, especially since we can get over 9 pounds of meat for about $35. The store also stocks pre-seasoned ribs, which are great when we're out of our homemade dry rub. We'll make these for ourselves or when having friends over for a barbecue. I'm a huge fan of Kirkland Signature products, and I especially like the label's organic Greek yogurt. It's perfect for making smoothies creamy or adding protein to granola. Now that I live in a house, I have room in my freezer to buy staples in bulk, like frozen strawberries. I'm usually pretty happy with the prices of frozen fruit at Costco, so I pick up mixed berries or strawberries there. Recently, I got 4 pounds of Kirkland Signature organic strawberries for $10, which felt like a steal compared to prices I've seen at other local grocery stores. Again, now that I have the space, I'm able to buy more household staples in bulk. We often pick up big packs of the Kirkland Signature paper towels and store them in our shed to optimize kitchen space. These affordable paper towels are thick and powerful. One 12-pack of rolls often lasts us over two months, especially since we supplement the use of them with microfiber cloths. Since we live in a house with a ton of random gadgets, we somehow always need batteries. I try to keep a few varieties on hand. Fortunately, we've found Kirkland Signature batteries to be fairly affordable and easy to buy in bulk. They especially came in handy during the recent California wildfires, when we lost power and needed to use flashlights. Working from home, I get distracted and find myself not hydrating frequently or as much as I should. So, I like that I can use Liquid IV to boost the flavor and hydration power of my water with electrolytes and sugar-free flavoring. I'm usually not able to find sugar-free Liquid IV at my local grocery stores, but Costco always seems to have some packs in stock. My partner and I typically each eat one Kirkland Signature protein bar a day. I don't eat too much meat, so these bars help me easily get 21 grams of protein when I need a boost. We usually buy the variety pack with 10 cookie-dough and 10 brownie bars. My partner likes the cookie-dough flavor, and I prefer the brownie one — a match made in heaven. I'm a huge date girl. Dates really are nature's candy. I love eating them raw on their own, making date bark with some peanut butter and chocolate chips, or incorporating them into a smoothie or yogurt bowl. They're a great source of fiber, potassium, and magnesium too. I love baking, but quality vanilla extract is a key ingredient in many recipes that can be expensive and hard to find in larger quantities. At Costco, however, I can find 16 ounces of pure vanilla extract for under $12. To me, that's an amazing deal. Kirkland Signature honey is one of our pantry staples since I'm a huge tea fan and love adding it to my drinks. I also recently got my partner into peppermint tea, which can be enhanced with a dollop of honey. This honey tastes high-quality — and getting three 24-ounce bottles of it for under $13 feels like a bargain. Yes, I still struggle with acne in my late 20s. I really like the pimple patches from Hero because they can hardly be seen when they're applied correctly. I'll often wear one or two when I'm traveling on a plane, taking a between-Zoom-meeting stroll, or even having virtual calls. The stickers help me avoid picking at my skin, and I'm a firm believer they make my pimples disappear much faster. As someone who deals with allergies, I always try to keep medication on hand that will help me deal with symptoms. Name-brand options can get pricey, especially since I take tablets every day. So, I opt for Kirkland Signature allergy medicine. The $5 bottle of 600 pills does my wallet a huge favor. One of the first things we did when moving into our first place together was buy a first-aid kit. After that, we stocked up on some of our staple medications, like ibuprofen Since moving to Los Angeles, my skin has struggled to adjust to the dry climate. So, I've been buying bulk packs of the CeraVe moisturizing cream and using it morning and night. Hydrating and not greasy, the cream has been my hero as of late. Plus, it's fairly affordable at Costco at $25 for two 16-ounce tubs. Perhaps one of the best things about Costco is that it's truly a one-stop shop. I always check the retailer's clothing section and often pick up a piece or two. My latest favorite purchase is the $18 two-piece lounge set from Honeydew. It's so cozy and especially great on long car or plane rides. Lastly, we end our shopping trip with celebratory Costco hot dogs, which cost just $1.50 each and come with a soft drink.
