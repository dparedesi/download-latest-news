Our expert, award-winning staff selects the products we cover and rigorously researches and tests our top picks. If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Reviews ethics statement Bulk groceries cost significantly less. Here are six staples you can stockpile for the next several months. We asked an expert about the best foods to buy in bulk. The price of groceries still remains a hot topic. According to a recent CNET survey, it's still the No. 1 source of sticker shock for Americans, myself included. We've covered numerous ways to save a little money in your grocery budget: food saving apps such as Flashfood; the difference in cost between name brand and store brand groceries; and whether shopping at Trader Joe's results in meaningful savings over other grocery chains. And, of course, there's buying in bulk. After doing some math, I found that the average person could save $1,000 a year by shopping at Costco for bulk foods. Buying in bulk can be more complicated, however, due to storage considerations, and the difference in shelf life between various items. According to Mary Ann Kelley, the meal planning expert behind AddSaltandServe, "Shoppers can ask themselves three questions: Will my savings be significant compared to the lowest price at all stores? Will I use the items before they expire or lose quality? A great price does not save money if the item will not be used. And finally, do I have room to store items I buy in bulk?" Read more: Here's what an expert told me about food expiration dates Accepting that bulk shopping is generally a financially savvy move, and given the considerations posed above, I asked a few shopping and meal prepping experts what the best foods are to buy in bulk. Here they are: Beans are packed with protein and they're the perfect candidates to buy in bulk. "Canned beans are a pantry staple and a smart bulk purchase, thanks to their long shelf life and affordability at warehouse stores," says Kristen Markel, the bulk shopping expert behind Warehouse Wanderer. Beans also are incredibly versatile for food prep, as they can fit into just about any meal, including dessert. (Black bean brownies are worth your time.) Plus they have real staying power. "Properly stored in a cool, dark place, canned beans can last up to five years," says Markel. An eight-pack of canned beans at Costco retails for about $7.99, bringing the cost per can to under a dollar, and the cost per serving to about 30 cents. If you've got the time and wherewithal for dried beans, the savings are even bigger. A 10-pound bag of black beans costs around $18, for a cost per serving of less than 25 cents. If freezer space allows, fish is far more affordable when you buy in bulk. Meat and seafood in the freezer section are often frozen right after harvesting, so they can still be very high in quality. You can also process proteins bought fresh and freeze them yourself, and either way certain types of meat and seafood can stay in your freezer for up to a year. (This FoodKeeper app from the US Department of Health and Human Services is a handy guide to how long you can store various foods.) "Shoppers can often find bulk-packaged fresh and frozen meat at a better price, or they may stock up on bulk amounts of normal packages of meat when they are on sale," says Kelley. It's possible to have a bulk shopping mindset even if you don't have access to a traditional bulk store. "Meat bought in bulk at a good price can be frozen as is, but shoppers can also save space -- and make dinner prep less stressful -- by cooking meats ahead that will be used later in cooked form in recipes. For instance, shoppers can cook bulk packages of ground beef or chicken when they bring them home, and then they can use the cooked meat for recipes like tacos, chili, and chicken soup." Butter is more shelf-stable than most people think, making it a good candidate for buying in bulk. We typically think primarily of the pantry or freezer when it comes to buying in bulk, but "don't overlook dairy, especially butter," says Markel. "Butter freezes beautifully and can last up to a year in the freezer." Costco's Kirkland Signature butter is considered one of its most economical offerings among fans, around $18 (in my region) for 4 pounds, which doesn't come with an overwhelming space requirement in the freezer. At my nearest grocery store, the same amount of butter costs twice that much. Boxed pasta lasts for up to two years. Boxed pasta may require some storage space, but if you're able to bulk up on it, it has the longevity to make it worthwhile. "Dry pasta is another bulk-buy winner, with an unopened shelf life of up to two years," says Markel. "For even longer storage, consider vacuum-sealing pasta to maintain freshness well beyond its typical expiration." (Here are the best vacuum sealers we've tested.) Eight pounds of Barilla penne cost $12.99 at Costco, which results in a savings of over a dollar per pound compared with buying individual boxes at my local supermarket. Italian American families, or carb lovers, take note. Not all spices are good to buy in bulk, but whole peppercorns keep their pep for a while. Items with the highest prices per ounce can be prime candidates for bulk shopping, on a case-by-case basis depending on longevity. "Specialty items that cost significantly less on sale can be worth buying in bulk, but only if they will be used," says Kelley. "A good example of this is expensive spices that might be used frequently, like quality black peppercorns," she says. Other specialty items that can be pricey but can be stockpiled when they're on sale include saffron, tinned fish and even caviar -- which can actually be frozen when unopened and kept for up to a year. If you want to get the most bang for your buck, buy paper towels and other household products in bulk. So long as you're bulk shopping, here's a bonus nonfood item. "Paper products are among the items that are less expensive to buy in bulk packaging, especially toilet paper and paper towels," says Kelley." "Since paper products do not need to be stored in a climate controlled area, utility spaces, attics, and other unfinished spaces are fine for storage, making it easier to make room for them." If you have a paper towel dependency, as I do, consider a 12-pack of Kirkland paper towels for $22.99, versus single rolls that can be as much as $3 and up.

Title: Better Capitalism Will Reduce The Need For Unions

EVERETT, WA - SEPTEMBER 06: Boeing machinist Scott Green, with his son Joshua, 3,on his shoulders, ... [+] walks the picket line outside Boeing's plant September 6, 2008 in Everett, Washington. Around 27,000 machinists are striking from the states of Washington State, Oregon and Kansas as Boeing faces its second major strike in three years. (Photo by Robert Giroux/Getty Images) One fascinating aspect of American business history is the pendulum-like swings in the attitudes of companies toward their employees, especially those who belong to (or wish they belonged to) unions. Every few decades or so, the pendulum seems to swing between hostility and collaboration, and the government tends to follow by increasing or decreasing regulations on the treatment of workers. The history of unions in America For instance, during the Gilded Age of the late 19th century, corporate owners had almost total freedom in their dealings with labor. Some spread the idea that most workers were lazy and didn’t deserve higher wages — an idea that justified strong resistance to unionization, by force if necessary. When the pendulum swung during the Progressive Era, reformers pushed the government to impose new rules that gave workers a better quality of life and a fairer chance at upward mobility. Unions began to gain more members and influence. As historian Heather Cox Richardson put it, “Prevailing opinion in the U.S. has seesawed between these two ideologies ever since.” She notes that from the end of World War I through the Roaring 20s, big business led a backlash against progressive regulations and a renewed trend toward laissez-faire capitalism. But with the Great Depression and FDR’s New Deal, most of America was again receptive to stricter business regulations and an improved social safety net for workers. The country became even more pro-union during the great post-World War II boom that lasted into the early 1970s. As Nicholas Kristof notes, “That was a magical period in American economic history, in which the economic pie grew rapidly and was also divided more fairly. Shareholders benefited, but so did workers, including African Americans at the bottom of the economic ladder.” Despite some corruption scandals and disruptive strikes during those decades, unions helped millions of workers join a broad and thriving middle class. As Kristof concludes: “Unions are as imperfect as capitalism itself, and just as essential.” The pendulum swung hard again in the early 1980s, when the Reagan administration promoted tax cuts, deregulation, and weaker protections for unions. As Richardson notes, “Those forty years, from 1981 to 2021, hollowed out the middle class as about $50 trillion moved from the bottom 90% of Americans to the top 1%.” Private-sector union membership plunged from 29% in 1970 to about 6% today, contributing toward more extreme inequality. Kristof adds that “As unions declined over the past half-century, workers… were paid poorly, they lost health care and retirement benefits, and they lost control over their schedules. They were robbed of dignity and sometimes of wages as well. Deaths of despair from drugs, alcohol and suicide surged among blue-collar workers.” The prevailing corporate mindset in this era was “shareholder primacy” — the idea that management should focus on maximizing short-term profits and the stock price, and therefore offering unions anything better than market-standard wages and benefits was wasteful. In response, the prevailing union mindset was fiercely adversarial: us versus them. In the face of management hostility, why should labor care about any employer’s needs and priorities? Labor leaders won union elections by promising to drive hard bargains, threatening strikes despite any pleas from management about the challenges or hard times a company faced. Companies focusing on workers But now, slowly but surely, we see the pendulum starting to swing again. A new generation of corporate leaders increasingly recognize the downsides of shareholder primacy and the benefits of multi-stakeholder capitalism. Some companies are moving away from treating workers as replaceable widgets — as pure cost centers — and increasingly see them as the key to improving productivity and innovation, which are now the key drivers of long-term profit. Some notable examples in recent years include Delta Airlines, Home Depot, Costco, Best Buy, and JP Morgan Chase. One of my favorite examples is C.H.I Overhead Doors, a small Midwestern manufacturer of garage doors. The private equity giant KKR acquired it in 2015 and spent the next two years trying to win the trust and engagement of employees. KKR announced a stock ownership program that could give everyone a big payoff if results improved. They offered better training and began consulting workers on strategic decisions. They promised more trust and respect, in contrast to the old-school mindset of the previous owners. For a long time, C.H.I. employees didn’t believe any of these promises. But KKR kept at it, such as by polling everyone about how to improve the plant’s work environment and investing real money to implement the top suggestions (air conditioning and a better cafeteria). Over time, employee trust and engagement finally rose, and C.H.I was able to adopt the Japanese system of continuous improvement (kaizen). Workers became bolder about making suggestions and were rewarded for them. One major triumph was a new sequence for making and delivering garage doors, which cut the time from order to delivery so dramatically that no competitor could keep up, driving a significant boost to market share. Trust is key to a long term solution If a private equity firm (stereotyped as ruthless corporate raiders) can overcome employee skepticism and adversarial thinking, so can any company. The first move has to come from management to prove good intent. Talking the talk is easy, but only actions can establish an unwritten agreement, separate from any official union contract: if employees help increase the value of the enterprise, they are entitled to a significant share of the incremental new value. To help align everyone’s interests, management can adopt mechanisms such as restricted stock grants. PayPal used this to great effect. In response, unions need to accept that they will be better off if they work with management to make the company more successful — to make the pie bigger before lobbying for a bigger slice. They can refocus their approach from adversarial to collaborative, such as by offering new ideas to improve results. Unions can even offer to take a bigger role in strategic planning, to signal that they seek a voice in where the company is going, rather than merely waiting to execute directions from above. As we saw during the recent Boeing strike, not every labor conflict is primarily about wages and benefits. Boeing employees were furious that the C-suite had ignored their safety warnings until they escalated into fatal crashes. Had management trusted those with the clearest view of potential safety problems, hundreds of lives might have been saved — along with billions of dollars in penalties and lost revenue. Boeing machinist Michael Glover gestures to passing cars while manning the picket line outside a ... [+] Boeing's plant. (Photo by Robert Giroux/Getty Images) I’m not naïve enough to think that every company is ready to embrace this pendulum swing. Last year the Economic Policy Institute found that more than 60 million non-union workers wished they had union representation, and the NLRB received more requests for union elections than they have in years. In response to this surge in labor organizing, EPI recognized that some companies, like Microsoft, New Flyer, and Ben & Jerry’s, were receptive to more positive labor relations. However, “Others have taken the opposite tack—to the extreme. Led by Elon Musk’s SpaceX, and joined by Amazon, Trader Joe’s, and Starbucks, these companies are engaged in a legal battle trying to have the NLRB declared unconstitutional…. Amazon, Trader Joe’s, and Starbucks have stalled the bargaining process—an all-too-typical move by corporations when workers first organize.” Nevertheless, I can imagine a future without unions — not because they’ve been crushed out of existence but because they will eventually become unnecessary. As more and more companies discover the enormous value of treating workers as partners rather than as cost centers, workers will increasingly reject the “us or them" mindset as counterproductive. We’ll see far fewer ugly strikes, more win-win collaborations, and more value for all stakeholders. And in that golden future, perhaps the pendulum will finally stop swinging. One Community.
