Unless you’re a real stickler for the finer points of the consumer tech industry, you might not know the history of the Vaio laptop series. But to miss the chaos unfolding from the Trump administration’s massive tariffs, you’d have to be living under a rock, under a penguin, on an uninhabited island in the Indian Ocean. The current owner of Vaio is leveraging this chaos to sell a few “tariff free” laptops. To address the first point: Yes, Vaio (stylized VAIO) laptops are still a thing, originally launched by Sony back in 1996 but spun off into an independent Japanese manufacturer when Sony exited the laptop business about a decade ago. It’s currently majority-owned by Japanese retailer Nojima. At the moment, Vaio offers three different series—the SX, SX-R, and FS—in 14-inch and 16-inch sizes. The designs are unremarkable and don’t often get spotted even on big retailers, but it looks like they’re getting some love from Costco as a US sales partner. According to Tom’s Hardware, the Vaio brand sent out emails to some customers hoping to lure them in with “Tariff Free Inventory.” While it doesn’t go into specifics, this is undoubtedly a reference to US president Donald Trump’s latest round of tariffs on nearly every country that supplies finished goods and raw materials to the United States. This sent stock prices and other economic indicators into a tailspin, in what’s already being referred to as “the 2025 stock market crash.” For the Japanese Vaio brand, which manufactures all its current models in a Nagano factory, the relevant tariff is the 24 percent tax on products from Japan, according to Reuters. Depending on how the tariffs are implemented on specific components, the 34 percent tax on goods from China and 32 percent tax on goods from Taiwan may also come into play for laptops sold in the US. In the best-case scenario, Vaio’s cheapest laptop at the moment will jump from $1,100 to $1,364, assuming Vaio passes the cost directly onto retailers and final buyers. For the SX-R mentioned in the “tariff free” email, the starting price would jump from $2,200 to $2,728 for the same model. For more estimations on how tariffs will affect consumer electronics prices, check out this breakdown. The prices on the Vaio website as of April 7th don’t seem to have changed much since January, as seen on the Internet Archive. It seems like a safe assumption that Vaio is promoting prices for current inventory held within the United States, which can be sold at today’s prices without fear of tariffs affecting profitability. It’ll be a few weeks before the latest round of tariffs imposed on goods being imported to the United States start impacting finished items being sold to consumers. If you’re in the market for a new laptop in the US, you might want to look for one right away. As Vaio demonstrates, there’s only a limited amount of computers in current supply line that can be sold at pre-Trump prices.

Title: Costco Executive members get MASSIVE $31,500 off Chevy Brightdrop van

With 272 miles of range and more room inside its walls than your first apartment, GM’s Chevy Brightdrop electric van is one of the best commercial EVs you can buy. And if you’re a Costco Executive member, you can get one for yourself or your business with an absolutely incredible $31,500 discount. (!) Fleet electrification expert Tony Nisam took to LinkedIn yesterday to post a deal that he ran across at a Washington State Costco that stacks a $25,500 manufacturer rebate with $3,000 in “regular” Costco Member Savings, $2,750 in “LIMITED-TIME” Manufacturer to Member Incentives, plus an additional $250 for Costco Executive members. Do a bit of math (add up 25,500 + 3,000 + $2,750 + 250), and you’ll calculate an almost unheard of $31,500 discount on one of the best, most capable commercial vans on the market – ICE or electric. And that’s before you factor in the 0% interest financing (72 mo.) being advertised at Blade Chevrolet, the Mount Vernon, Washington, where VIN 2G58J2TY6S9104313 (the exact van shown, below) is shown as stock number 16757. If you’re not a Costco member yet and you’re looking for a new truck for your business or even a unique #vanlife ride with zero emissions, modern tech, and a nationwide dealer network, GM makes that $130 Executive membership seem like a no-brainer. “But wait,” says the floating, disembodied ghost of the great Billy Mays. “There’s more!” In addition to the $31,500 worth of discounts Costco Executive members get, there are deals to be had on chargers AND a number of other state and local utility incentives your business might qualify for, bringing the cost of adding a new Chevy Brightdrop to your fleet even lower. In northern Illinois, for example, ComEd commercial customers can get up to $7,500 in rebates for a new Brightdrop Zevo van. Is a $39,000 price cut enough to get you to take a look at a new Brightdrop? At $45,235 (from a starting price of $84,235), can you afford not to? Head down to the comments and let us know.

Title: I built a 'tariff pantry' for my family. These are my top 4 hacks.
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/we-have-a-tariff-pantry-to-prepare-for-rising-costs-2025-4
Time Published: 2025-04-04T19:02:37Z
Full Content:
Whether you've seen Mark Cuban's advice to go to Walmart and buy "lots of consumables" before prices increase or how some Americans are already stockpiling goods, you may be wondering whether to prepare for the potential impact of upcoming tariffs on your family We have been bracing for rising costs since the election results came in. My husband and I have spent the last four months building what we started calling our "tariff pantry." If the prices of groceries and household necessities continue to rise, and our paychecks remain the same, it will bust our budget It's time to get creative. It's always been important for us to keep an emergency reserve of food on hand in case of a natural disaster, as we live in Indiana with power outages in the winter and tornadoes in the spring. Starting in November 2024, our family and several of our friends decided it was time to take that a bit further. We started building "tariff pantries." Assuming tariffs raise prices, we will have a good reserve of food and household supplies on hand to fall back on. The right amount to have on hand varies from household to household. Some friends are stocking up on emergency rations in case of major disruptions, but others are just keeping an extra week or two of groceries in the house. Here's my approach: If I can have a pantry full of groceries and household supplies now, then I can save money later when costs have increased. If milk skyrockets in price, I can still buy it but keep my overall spending low if I already have other essentials at home. I've used some basic calorie calculations (2000 calories per adult per day) to set aside five to six weeks of food. Although my approach is to use this pantry to supplement my groceries, not as our sole source of food, having several weeks on hand seemed like a good way to calculate our options. It's tempting to run to Costco and buy everything I see, just in case we need it later. But that's not actually going to create any savings; if I load up a credit card with expenses I can't immediately pay off, I'm adding to my expenses, not saving anything. That's why I've set up four rules for quickly building my food reserves. 1. Buy what you can afford. This means your pantry, like mine, may not be stocked as quickly as someone else's, or with as much food. But a small emergency supply is better than none at all. Account for food storage needs, like mylar bags, mouse-proof plastic containers, and 5-gallon buckets. 2. The clearance aisle is your friend. Instead of trying to master the art of couponing, I'm focused on finding clearance and sale items. I buy a little bit extra every time I go to the grocery store. Look for foods with a long shelf life and a distant expiration date. Speaking of expiration dates, things that are about to expire aren't always the best for a long-term pantry. However, you can get household items like toothbrushes, shampoo, and cleaning supplies from the clearance section that have no expiration dates. Apps like Flashfood can give you access to clearance-priced grocery store produce, meat, and dairy that is about to reach its "use by" date. If you have freezer space, you can purchase and freeze these items for long-term use. I've added quite a bit of meat to my deep freezer using this method. Use this Food Safety Chart to learn the best timeframe for freezing foods safely. 3. Think beyond the grocery store. I'm committed to having a garden again this year. I've often had a hobby garden that costs more than it helps me save, but my garden has to work harder this year. To save costs, I'm starting plants from seeds instead of buying established plants later in the season---I've already started vegetables in peat pots indoors. Consider what resources may be available in your area. For example, a local Amish grocery store near us often has great prices on seasonings, jams, baking supplies, and canning supplies. Some items, like bulk products from Costco or local suppliers, can be shared with friends. A good friend of mine doesn't have the space or time to garden this year, so she's arranging to trade some of her skills for extra produce from friends' gardens. 4. Remember Covid-era lessons. I find myself thinking back to those early pandemic days lately. When we suddenly had to stop going to the grocery store, we learned a lot of lessons about what to have on hand. This isn't an opportunity to practice over-consumption or hoarding — rather, it's a time to be intentional about what we have in stock. For example, don't buy things because you think you might start baking bread or cooking beans from scratch and changing everything about the way you eat. Also, focus on what your family eats, not what others add to their pantry. In our family, the point of a tariff pantry is to create a buffer between our spending and the impact of tariffs. By responsibly storing food based on what we actually need and can afford, we're keeping our costs down. More importantly, we're giving ourselves some peace of mind at a time when we have little control. Jump to

Title: We asked BI's newsroom who is spending ahead of tariffs — and who is holding off

Let's get this out of the way from the jump — it's always best to avoid panic-buying and be strategic when making purchases. But to get a sense of how people are weighing their spending right now, we asked reporters and editors across BI's newsroom to tell us what they're choosing to purchase right now — or why they're holding off — ahead of Donald Trump's latest round of tariffs. For some, potential price hikes on consumer electronics out of China were the tipping point to pull the trigger on a gadget. Others purchased some extra daily consumables or said they were considering a similar move. And some said their spending habits remain unchanged. Let's dive in: Chief correspondent Peter Kafka: On Thursday, instead of checking out my 401(k), I bought a new MacBook Air from Apple, on their website. I have an Apple Card, so I was able to finance it at 0% APR. It's possible Tim Cook will figure out how to get Donald Trump to exempt Apple from tariffs like he did the first time around. Maybe he won't. But either way my kid will need a new computer in the next few months, so I figured I should get one now. I don't know when I'll look at my 401(k), though. Editor Conz Preti: My husband and I are also stocking up on shelf-stable foods. With three kids who rip through food every week, we are keeping our pantry stocked with pasta, canned food, and baking supplies. For veggies, we are planting as much as we can (tomatoes, kale, lettuce, cucumber, peas, carrots) in our garden to offset some costs of things we can't grow, like berries and bananas that our kids love. Trending reporter Ana Altchek: I will be taking a wait-and-see approach. I don't think it's possible to fully predict the market and prepare for possible price hikes — who knows how individual companies will be impacted and how they'll choose to respond? I definitely don't want to overspend in preparation for something that may or may not happen. Plus, I'd rather pay a little extra for some items I know I need in six months than overspend right now on items I may need. Real estate reporter Alcynna Lloyd: I wear hair extensions and ordered some in case tariffs drive up prices or items stop shipping as they did during COVID-19. The wig and extension industry relies heavily on suppliers from China and other Asia-based countries, and during the pandemic, it was a nightmare to get products. Editor Steven Tweedie: I'm ordering larger bags of cat food than I normally would since I know I'll go through it all, and it'll keep. Otherwise, I'm doing my best to resist using this as an excuse to spend on something I don't actually need, like a new Nvidia Graphics card for my PC — even though I'm guessing I'll end up spending more a year or two from now when I finally do upgrade. Senior retail reporter Alex Bitter: I bought a new trench-digging shovel (made in China) on Thursday and will probably pick up another this weekend. I use them for metal detecting and want a spare or two in case one breaks. In general, though, I'm not stocking up on much. These tariffs cover so many products that it seems like avoiding them entirely will be impossible, especially in the long run. Editor Andy Kiersz: I bought a new gaming laptop in December. I'd been considering upgrading at some point but had originally planned to do so later in 2025. The election and subsequent threat of tariffs spurred the move. I'm actually now somewhat regretting not also replacing my still-functional but definitely showing-its-age iPhone 11. Senior correspondent Katie Notopoulos: On Tuesday evening, I did a last-minute shop for things I thought would be most obviously sensitive to the tariffs — cheap fast-fashion clothing made overseas. I hit up the H&M near the BI office for three polyester shirts and a pack of socks. I placed the Old Navy order that I've had in my cart for two weeks for kids' swimsuits and summer clothes. Finally, in a last moment of panic and extreme dopamine low, I went onto Temu and ordered a few cheap toys for a kid's upcoming birthday. On Wednesday, talking with coworkers about how they had bought new laptops and TVs, a flash of Bad Ideas went through my mind. Did I need a new phone? (No, my iPhone 14 is working just fine.) Computer? (No, mine is working fine.) Surely, electronics will go up in price — perhaps now is the time to get a new Kindle? (No. Stop!) Editor Brad Davis: I'm not buying anything special — and I won't! Will my stubbornness come back to bite me, like when I refused to stock up on masks in March 2020? (I really wished I had bought those masks by April of that year.) Editor Ashley Rodriguez: I'm thinking about stocking up on diapers and wipes. My Costco stashes on both are running low. It's a tough decision because my 7-month-old has been growing so quickly that I worry she'll outgrow the diapers before I have a chance to use them all. Reporter Alice Tecotzky: As a devoted baker, I bought an extra bottle of vanilla Thursday despite still having some left in my pantry. Much of our vanilla comes from Madagascar, which was hit with a 47% tariff, and I anticipate the already pricey product will only get more expensive (and derail my long-awaited summer baking plans). Other than that, I'm not stockpiling too much, both because the economic future seems impossible to predict and because I don't have space in my small Brooklyn apartment. Editor Monica Melton: When my 2020 HP laptop gave up the ghost in February, I promptly handed it over to an e-waste recycling program. Since then, I've been borrowing my husband's MacBook Pro, telling myself I'd do research on the specs and best deal for my next personal computer. While this has taken me months to get around to, given how tariffs will impact the price of consumer electronics, I feel a renewed urgency to get that laptop this weekend. I'll likely choose a refurbished MacBook, which I reckon would hold up better than another HP. The resale market for electronics is looking a lot more appealing these days! Senior correspondent Emily Stewart: I am … not buying anything. Not because I'm not worried about tariffs! But honestly, I do not need anything right now, and I'm trying to fight my consumerist, "What should I buy about this?" tendencies. Obviously, price increases are bad. But I don't think it's bad to take a beat and think about whether I actually need to be drowning in even more stuff, especially as I stare at the robot vacuum I panic-bought during the pandemic that I have used a handful of times and is now broken. Editor Paige DiFiore: Earlier this week, we replaced our dying air fryer — it might've lasted us a few more months but we'd rather buy a new one now before prices could go up. Now, I'm stocking up on household essentials that won't expire, like toilet paper, dishwasher pods, and laundry detergent at BJ's. My fiancé and are I big coffee drinkers, so we just ordered some bags of espresso from our favorite Italian brand — but we can't buy too much because its shelf life is only a few months. I'm very concerned about how expensive coffee could get since it's not something the US produces on a large scale. We're getting married this year, so I'm relieved most of my guests purchased bridal shower gifts before the tariffs were announced. I'd feel bad if items on the list, like small appliances, cost even more than they already do. Editor Leena Rao: On Wednesday afternoon, shortly after the tariffs were announced, my husband went to the Apple Store and bought a new iPhone 16 Pro and a MacBook Pro. These weren't time-sensitive purchases, but given the potential rise in costs of hardware, we wanted to preempt any price increases. We are in the process of leasing a new car (a Volvo) and have one on order that's supposed to arrive in the next two weeks. I don't believe the model of our car is made in the United States. I'm hopeful we won't incur any additional costs for our monthly lease price, but we won't find out until the car arrives and we officially sign the paperwork for the lease. Editor Debbie Strong: I replaced my dishwasher last week and splurged on a slightly fancier model. The motor had broken on our old one, so this was less of a "tariff panic" purchase and more of an "I refuse to hand-wash another dish" emergency buy. Still, I'm relieved at the timing, as dishwashers have been repeatedly flagged as an item about to get way more expensive. I don't have any other plans to stock up on goods, mainly because I don't have the headspace for it right now. We'll see if that changes next time I'm at the grocery store. Jump to

Title: I finally get the Costco hype now that I moved from an apartment to a house. Here are 18 purchases I swear by.

I grew up in New York City and have always lived in small apartments without much storage space. It just never made sense for me to buy groceries in bulk. However, my partner and I recently moved to Los Angeles, and now we have a whole house to ourselves. One of the best perks of our new life is taking monthly trips to Costco for all our favorite items. Here are my favorite things to get there. We tend to have a Costco shopping trip at least once a month, and I also go there about once a week to fuel my car. Gas is expensive, especially in Los Angeles, and Costco typically has unbeatable prices — particularly for premium, which is what my Mini Cooper takes. The best part is I can easily check the rate on a daily basis when using the store's app, which helps me determine if Costco gas prices are better than competitors that day. My partner is a carnivore to the max. To him, nothing beats the five-pack of the Kirkland Signature boneless New York steaks. They taste great on the grill or in a cast-iron pan and are often the star of a delicious weekday meal for us. We never skip out on buying Costco's ribs, especially since we can get over 9 pounds of meat for about $35. The store also stocks pre-seasoned ribs, which are great when we're out of our homemade dry rub. We'll make these for ourselves or when having friends over for a barbecue. I'm a huge fan of Kirkland Signature products, and I especially like the label's organic Greek yogurt. It's perfect for making smoothies creamy or adding protein to granola. Now that I live in a house, I have room in my freezer to buy staples in bulk, like frozen strawberries. I'm usually pretty happy with the prices of frozen fruit at Costco, so I pick up mixed berries or strawberries there. Recently, I got 4 pounds of Kirkland Signature organic strawberries for $10, which felt like a steal compared to prices I've seen at other local grocery stores. Again, now that I have the space, I'm able to buy more household staples in bulk. We often pick up big packs of the Kirkland Signature paper towels and store them in our shed to optimize kitchen space. These affordable paper towels are thick and powerful. One 12-pack of rolls often lasts us over two months, especially since we supplement the use of them with microfiber cloths. Since we live in a house with a ton of random gadgets, we somehow always need batteries. I try to keep a few varieties on hand. Fortunately, we've found Kirkland Signature batteries to be fairly affordable and easy to buy in bulk. They especially came in handy during the recent California wildfires, when we lost power and needed to use flashlights. Working from home, I get distracted and find myself not hydrating frequently or as much as I should. So, I like that I can use Liquid IV to boost the flavor and hydration power of my water with electrolytes and sugar-free flavoring. I'm usually not able to find sugar-free Liquid IV at my local grocery stores, but Costco always seems to have some packs in stock. My partner and I typically each eat one Kirkland Signature protein bar a day. I don't eat too much meat, so these bars help me easily get 21 grams of protein when I need a boost. We usually buy the variety pack with 10 cookie-dough and 10 brownie bars. My partner likes the cookie-dough flavor, and I prefer the brownie one — a match made in heaven. I'm a huge date girl. Dates really are nature's candy. I love eating them raw on their own, making date bark with some peanut butter and chocolate chips, or incorporating them into a smoothie or yogurt bowl. They're a great source of fiber, potassium, and magnesium too. I love baking, but quality vanilla extract is a key ingredient in many recipes that can be expensive and hard to find in larger quantities. At Costco, however, I can find 16 ounces of pure vanilla extract for under $12. To me, that's an amazing deal. Kirkland Signature honey is one of our pantry staples since I'm a huge tea fan and love adding it to my drinks. I also recently got my partner into peppermint tea, which can be enhanced with a dollop of honey. This honey tastes high-quality — and getting three 24-ounce bottles of it for under $13 feels like a bargain. Yes, I still struggle with acne in my late 20s. I really like the pimple patches from Hero because they can hardly be seen when they're applied correctly. I'll often wear one or two when I'm traveling on a plane, taking a between-Zoom-meeting stroll, or even having virtual calls. The stickers help me avoid picking at my skin, and I'm a firm believer they make my pimples disappear much faster. As someone who deals with allergies, I always try to keep medication on hand that will help me deal with symptoms. Name-brand options can get pricey, especially since I take tablets every day. So, I opt for Kirkland Signature allergy medicine. The $5 bottle of 600 pills does my wallet a huge favor. One of the first things we did when moving into our first place together was buy a first-aid kit. After that, we stocked up on some of our staple medications, like ibuprofen Since moving to Los Angeles, my skin has struggled to adjust to the dry climate. So, I've been buying bulk packs of the CeraVe moisturizing cream and using it morning and night. Hydrating and not greasy, the cream has been my hero as of late. Plus, it's fairly affordable at Costco at $25 for two 16-ounce tubs. Perhaps one of the best things about Costco is that it's truly a one-stop shop. I always check the retailer's clothing section and often pick up a piece or two. My latest favorite purchase is the $18 two-piece lounge set from Honeydew. It's so cozy and especially great on long car or plane rides. Lastly, we end our shopping trip with celebratory Costco hot dogs, which cost just $1.50 each and come with a soft drink.
