The Switch 2 Pro Controller will be cheaper for Costco shoppers. By Amanda Kay Oaks Late last week, Costco added a listing for the Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World bundle, confirming the retailer would carry the console at launch. While we still don’t have an exact price for that bundle, it’s likely to be at a bit of a discount for members, given that that’s kind of Costco’s thing. However, a new Switch 2 listing on Costco’s website today does come with a price tag attached, and it’s exciting news for fans struggling with those Switch 2 accessory price hikes. The Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller is now up on Costco’s US website, and this time, we’ve got the exact price along with the details. The controller will be available for Costco members on June 5th alongside the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2. And thanks to @Wario64 and their Costco membership, we have confirmation that the Switch 2 Pro Controller will cost $69.99 for Costco members. Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller will be $69.99 at Costco (releasing June 5) buff.ly/KGizwJW While that price might not be the most exciting number to see, it’s certainly a steep discount compared to other retailers. Following the accessory price increases announced due to U.S. Tariffs, the Switch 2 Pro Controller is listed for $84.99 at most retailers that have it up, including Best Buy and GameStop. That means the Costco listing shows off an impressive $15 discount on the new Pro Controller. For those who want to get ahold of the updated version, this is excellent news, so long as you’ve got a Costco membership to get your hands on it. The Pro Controller is, so far, the only Nintendo Switch 2 accessory listed for sale at Costco. It joins the listing for the Switch 2 + Mario Kart World bundle for a grand total of two Switch 2 listings at the retailer so far. Given that there’s still a little over a month to go, it’s possible we could see additional Switch 2 options and accessories added to the list at Costco. That said, the retailer does tend to offer fewer accessories compared to other stores that specialize in gaming items. Currently, there’s a good list of new accessories launching alongside the Switch 2 on June 5th. This includes the new Switch 2 camera to use with the Game Chat feature, Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Cons, a Switch 2-specific Carrying Case and Screen Protector, Joy-Con straps and charging grips for the Switch 2, and the Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller. All of these items saw a price increase following the original announcement, making them a bit more expensive than players initially expected. With any luck, a few more of those accessories could wind up with a similar Costco discount to what we’re seeing for the Switch 2 Pro Controller. Otherwise, getting everything you want to go along with your shiny new Switch 2 console could wind up being pretty pricey in 2025. The Nintendo Switch 2, along with several new accessories, will launch on June 5th. For now, most retailers have closed or run out of stock on pre-orders, so gamers who haven’t yet secured the console will need to wait for June 5th to get one from their preferred store. Those buying directly from the Nintendo shop online should start getting purchase invites next week, as they’re set to start going out on May 8th.

Title: Costco, Walmart and other places to buy gold this May

May 2, 2025 / 11:21 AM EDT / CBS News The benefits of gold investing have long been clear, and they remain relatively unchanged, even in the unpredictable economic climate of early 2025. Historically known as a smart inflation hedge, thanks to its ability to maintain its value during inflationary periods, gold has maintained that feature in recent years, as demonstrated by a consistent rise in price as inflation spiked. It's also stayed reliable as a portfolio diversification tool, as was seen in recent weeks, as the price broke numerous records while stock market uncertainty was particularly high in April. While the features of gold remain relatively well-known and particularly pronounced, how to get started with a gold investment can remain elusive and less clear to prospective investors. It's not something that can be as easy to invest in as stocks, bonds and even real estate. Or at least, historically, it wasn't. But now, in early 2025, there are multiple places in which investors can buy physical gold bars and coins. And that purchase doesn't need to be complicated, as it can take place at a local trusted retailer or even from the comfort of your home. Below, we'll compile a list of places in which you can buy gold from this May, and begin the process of protecting and diversifying your wider portfolio. Start exploring your top gold investing resources here now. Ready to invest in physical gold? Prefer the tangibility of gold bars and coins, specifically? Then consider buying the precious metal from one or more of the following locations: Multiple gold individual retirement account (IRA) companies do business online, offering you the comfort of completing your transaction with a trusted and verifiable organization. These companies can be reviewed online and many offer free guides and the chance to speak directly with a specialist who can answer your questions and help you get started with a customized gold investment. The range of investment types tends to be wider with these companies as well as they offer gold bars, coins, IRAs and more. Some even offer alternative precious metal investments, like silver, for those who don't want to pay the elevated price gold is currently selling for. Just be sure to compare offers from multiple companies to determine which one is truly offering the most cost-effective investment options. Research the top gold companies online today. Costco got into the gold market in 2023, notably selling out of 1-ounce gold bars relatively quickly. By last spring, it was selling $200 million in gold (and silver) each month. And it's easy to understand why. Costco is a trusted brand, known for its affordable prices, bulk sales and ease of in-person shopping. Their gold selection also comes from authorized dealers and trustworthy mints, making a gold addition to your shopping cart, whether it be online or in the store, both valuable and reliable. More of a Walmart shopper instead? The retailer also offers gold to customers now in the form of bars and coins. And, like Costco, it can be purchased online or in select stores for those who prefer to examine their gold investment prior to purchasing. And with options ranging from 1-gram gold bars to 1-ounce gold bars, there's likely a type for each prospective gold investor, regardless of their budget. If you want to avoid the crowds of big box stores but aren't well-versed or don't want to spend time researching your gold IRA company options, consider heading to your local jeweler this May. With gold prices in the news on a near-daily basis, they're likely well-versed in the intricacies of gold investing right now and can offer you a more personalized approach than you may be able to get with Costco or Walmart. That said, they may also tack on a bigger markup than you'd pay elsewhere, so it's important to visit these stores with a realistic price in mind — and be willing to walk out if the jeweler isn't willing to sell you the gold for the same (or better) price that you can secure with one of the other options on this list. With gold ubiquitous right now, prospective investors or those looking to bulk up their current gold investments have plenty of viable options to explore. Just don't let the wide range of options overwhelm you, either. The important thing is to invest in gold at a cost-effective price and in the right amount now in order to secure the portfolio protection gold has always offered. Where you buy it from is less important than simply adding it to your portfolio this May, which will allow you to better weather this current, unpredictable economic climate.

Title: What is — and isn’t — getting pricier under Trump’s tariffs?

We focus on being useful to you — breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm. We rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today? Prices are rising due to Trump’s tariffs — but not universally just yet. by Nicole Narea President Donald Trump warned of short-term pain resulting from his tariffs. That pain has arrived in the form of higher prices — and it might not be temporary. A wide range of products — from car tires to clothing, many of which are produced in China — have seen price hikes in recent weeks as retailers face increased costs due to tariffs. Executives of big-box stores have reportedly warned the White House that they may have no choice but to pass some of those costs on to American consumers, and that product shortages could follow. Not all price increases are happening at once or on the same scale. That’s in part because some retailers took steps to mitigate the initial impact of tariffs on their businesses. But any price increases will put pressure on Americans who were already struggling to keep up with inflation in the post-pandemic era. This year, lower-income consumers, in particular, are already pulling back on spending, and the Yale Budget Lab has projected that the tariffs could cost Americans an average of $4,900 per household. That’s left retailers reluctant to raise prices too much and drive away customers. Businesses that can afford it have been stockpiling inventory for months in an attempt to keep prices low and ride out the tariffs, hoping that Trump will change course. “I think they probably can make it until the holiday season,” said Edmund Zagorin, founder and chief strategy officer at Arkestro, a supply chain startup that helps companies use AI for procurement of materials and services. But if Trump digs in his heels on tariffs for the long haul, the current price hikes might only be the beginning. Clothing, electronics, household products, baby items, and more are already more expensive now that the tariffs have taken effect, raising costs for retailers that they are passing on to consumers. Chinese retailers Temu and Shein have announced that they are starting to raise prices. Price hikes vary by category of goods, but Bloomberg reported that Shein prices rose by about 10 percent in a two-day span last week. Temu has added “import charges” of 145 percent of an item’s cost. Their announcements came before Trump eliminated what’s called the “de minimis” exemption for Chinese imports on May 2. Under that exemption, shipments of goods valued at less than $800 — the vast majority of Temu and Shein orders — are exempt from tariffs. Some Amazon sellers have also raised their prices in recent weeks. E-commerce software company SmartScout found that 930 products sold on Amazon have seen price hikes since early April, increasing by 29 percent on average. About 25 percent of those increases have come from sellers based in China. Companies from Procter & Gamble to Goodyear to Hermès have also announced price increases due to tariffs. Others appear to have done so quietly, with Logitech raising its prices by as much as 25 percent in the wake of the tariffs without explanation. Others, including Walmart, Target, and Home Depot, reportedly told Trump they are prepared to raise prices if the tariffs remain in place. Executives at Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile have said that if smartphones (which are currently exempt from the highest tariff rates) are later targeted with new tariffs, they will also raise their prices. Companies that make goods in the US won’t necessarily be spared. Even if products are made in the country, their component parts may be fabricated elsewhere, meaning that they will now cost more to produce. Although many companies have announced drastic price increases, the effect of tariffs on prices has not been uniform so far. There are a few reasons for that. For one, supply chains are now much more robust to shocks like tariffs than they were even just a few years ago. After the pandemic upended global supply chains (recall the 2020 run on toilet paper), companies took steps to invest in warehousing and increase their US inventory to avoid future shortages. The total value of US business inventory adjusted for inflation has increased from $1.9 trillion at its trough in June 2020 to about $2.6 trillion in February 2025. That means that many businesses already had stockpiles of products that weren’t subject to the current tariffs. “We’re not going to see anything like what we saw during Covid,” Zagorin said. “Companies just carry more inventory, they have higher safety stock levels. ... The supply chain is much more inherently resilient as a result.” Companies such as Sony, Apple, Williams-Sonoma, and Costco have also taken additional steps to further expand their US inventory ahead of the tariffs. That means that some big-box retailers are “sitting on an inventory glut in certain categories where they estimate there to be demand,” Zagorin said. That has caused shipping activity to decrease in the immediate term, he added. Ship tracking data shows that 33 percent fewer freight vessels are slated to arrive at a major port in Los Angeles in the first full week in May than in the same week last year. “There are no ships coming into the port in Seattle and LA because the beast has eaten, and the beast is full,” Zagorin said. But not all businesses can afford to stockpile, especially if they have limited capital or are launching a new product. Perishable items can’t be stockpiled, meaning that prices of things like imported fresh produce could jump sooner. And there is only so long that retailers’ stockpiles will last. If Trump maintains the tariffs, particularly the high rates on China, through the end of the year, it would create significant supply chain challenges across US businesses, and American consumers would ultimately pay the price. “People are not betting on — especially the 145 percent tariff [on Chinese imports] — being a long-term, to-the-end-of-the-year phenomenon,” Zagorin said. “And I think if it is, then probably some of the things that you’re seeing headlines about are going to happen, like empty shelves, right in time for the holidays.” Understand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.

Title: Nintendo Switch 2: The new system update, sold-out pre-orders and everything else you need to know
URL: https://slashdot.org/firehose.pl?op=view&amp;id=177225055

With the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct showcase behind us, we now know more about the console than ever before, including its release date (June 5) and price ($450). We're also keeping a close eye on how the recently-announced tariffs in the United States are affecting Nintendo's launch plans. Pre-orders in the US and Canada are now set to start on April 24. Thanks to Nintendo's January 16 teaser trailer, we've long known what the Switch 2 will look like, and that it will arrive in 2025 — over eight years after its predecessor. The Nintendo Switch 2 looks very similar to the original system, albeit with a larger display, magnetic Joy-Cons and a sleeker design. The upcoming console will be backwards compatible with Switch games. Looking to catch up on everything we know about the Switch 2? Read on. The Nintendo Switch 2 has a 1080p 7.9-inch display with a 120Hz refresh and HDR compatibility. It also supports up to 4K output at 120Hz (with variable refresh rates) when docked. The new Joy-Con 2 for Nintendo Switch 2 attaches magnetically with a button to release them. They have larger SL and SR buttons (the ones hidden when the Joy-Con are attached) to make playing multiplayer games on individual Joy-Cons more feasible. These buttons are also made of steel and attach to the Switch 2's magnets. The analog sticks are no longer tiny nubs, and are closer in size to the ones you might find on a PS5 or Xbox controller. However, they do not have Hall effect sensors, the use of which can minimize the risk of the "stick drift" issue that plagued the original Joy-Cons. The Joy-Con 2 have what Nintendo is calling “HD Rumble 2” built in, which seems to be a refinement of the original (and still very good) vibration function. Finally, each Joy-Con 2 has an optical sensor that allows you to use it as a mouse, and a C button, which we’ll get to in a minute. The new Pro Controller for the Nintendo Switch 2 comes with everything you’d expect based on the refreshed Joy-Con 2: Namely HD Rumble 2 and the C button. There are also remappable GL/GR buttons around the back and a standard audio jack for connecting a headset. Both options come with Amiibo support built in. The Switch 2 comes with two Joy-Con 2, as you’d expect, and additional pairs are priced at $95. The Pro Controller will cost $85. The new C button is a dedicated way to enter a chat session with friends. As well as the standard features you’d expect from voice chat, Nintendo has built a Discord-like video-sharing feature, which lets you show your gameplay to others and see other people’s screens while you’re playing. The GameChat function works with a mic built into the console, though headsets are also supported. Nintendo will also sell a $55 camera that plugs into the USB-C port on the top of the console, which will allow you to stream your face along with your game. The Switch 2 will work with GameCube games via the Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack. The three titles available at launch will be F-Zero GX, The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker and Soul Calibur II. Perhaps the biggest feature, though, is one you can’t see: The Switch 2 has an all-new processor and GPU and significantly more storage (256GB vs 64GB in the Switch OLED), along with support for faster and more capacious microSD cards. This will obviously lead to better first-party games and upgraded Switch experiences, but more importantly it will mean multi-platform games that had to skip the original, underpowered Switch will be able to be ported over. With games like Cyberpunk 2077 coming to the Switch 2 at launch, it seems like far more ports will be feasible than on the original console. Another major improvement comes in the form of networking — the Switch 2 supports Wi-Fi 6, which will improve the original's often glacial download speeds. Similarly, the new dock sports an Ethernet port for a rock-solid connection. Nintendo gave the press a chance to check out the Switch 2 and a few of the games it highlighted. You can read our impressions of Mario Kart World as well as more general thoughts on how the Switch 2 feels in person. Right off the bat, Mario Kart World feels like an outstanding launch title, with more depth and better visuals than we've ever seen from a Mario Kart game. The core formula is intact, but there are a lot of new features and play styles to dig into. As for the Switch 2 hardware, it feels like a major step forward from the original Switch — it has grown up a lot and feels far more polished and refined. And while it may not have an OLED screen, the 7.9-inch LED display Nintendo did use is outstanding. June 5, 2025. Switch 2 pre-orders were initially set to begin on April 9, but the following week, Nintendo said it was suspending pre-order plans in the US "indefinitely" in reaction to a slate of tariffs imposed by President Trump. Finally, when pre-orders opened on April 24, a hot mess ensued. Those who stayed up late trying to snag a Switch 2 were often left empty-handed as Walmart, Best Buy and Target’s websites weren’t fully equipped for the demand. Many customers were left with unmoving queues and error messages — a familiar process for many who’ve tried to pre-order a hot gaming or tech product in recent years. (Folks who pre-ordered a PS5 during the pandemic caught the nastiest case of deja vu.) No retailers are currently taking Switch 2 pre-orders. Although there’s always the chance one will drop an unexpected stock refresh, your best option right now is to register your interest with Nintendo. That may not lead to a launch-day console, as Nintendo has warned, but it won’t likely be a crazy delay like those familiar to GPU buyers. And if your Nintendo cred ticks the right boxes (you have been subscribed to Switch Online for at least 12 months, have opted in to share gameplay data, and have at least 50 total gameplay hours), your odds will improve. Costco is a dark-horse candidate for day-one availability. The retailer doesn’t appear to have taken any Switch 2 pre-orders, but a product listing claims it will have Mario Kart World console bundles in stock on launch day. In any case, Nintendo says the console’s June 5 release date is unchanged. On April 2, Nintendo announced that the Switch 2 would cost $450 standalone, or $500 with a bundled digital copy of the new Mario Kart game, Mario Kart World. That’s significantly more expensive than the original Switch, which launched at $300, and has remained at that price ever since. It’s also more expensive than the entry-level current-gen consoles from Sony and Microsoft. The comparison looks a little better up against Valve’s Steam Deck, which costs $400 for the LCD model or $550 for the basic OLED model. The Steam Deck is more affordable than most PC handhelds. When Nintendo delayed the pre-orders from the original date of April 9, it said it was doing so "in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions." With heavy US tariffs levied on Nintendo's Asian production centers, the implication was that would have little choice but to pass at least some of those costs on to American consumers. But Trump's April 9 tariff pivot — reverting to 10 percent across the board for 90 days for all countries except China, which now gets a triple-digit hit — further muddied the waters. That's because it's unclear how much, if any, of the components and assembly of US-bound Switch 2 consoles will originate in China. The administration exempted some electronics from reciprocal tariffs, but they'll soon be subject to new levies on semiconductors. Some analysts suggest that Nintendo will be selling consoles at a loss in the US with even a 10 percent tariff. Nevertheless, the company is keeping the price of the Switch 2 at $450 and the Mario Kart World bundle at $450. However, it noted that it had to increase the prices of Switch 2 accessories "due to changing market conditions" and added that other price modifications may occur in the future for a similar reason. When Nintendo announced the rescheduled Switch 2 pre-order date for the US and Canada, it confirmed price increases for many of the console's accessories. The current US prices for the accessories are as follows: Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller — $85 Joy-Con 2 Pair — $95 Joy-Con 2 Charging Grip — $40 Joy-Con 2 Strap — $14 Joy-Con 2 Wheel Set — $25 Nintendo Switch 2 Camera — $55 Nintendo Switch 2 Dock Set — $120 Nintendo Switch 2 Carrying Case & Screen Protector — $40 Nintendo Switch 2 All-In-One Carrying Case — $85 Nintendo Switch 2 AC Adapter — $35 Samsung microSD Express Card – 256GB for Nintendo Switch 2 — $60 The price of the Joy-Con 2 strap has gone up by $1, but the prices of other products have risen by between $5 and $10, with the dock set getting the larger increase. Thankfully, your Nintendo Switch 2 will come with a dock. Nintendo also released a list of accessory prices for Canada. Nintendo says that the Switch 2 will last between 2 and 6.5 hours on a single charge. This is similar to the original Switch, which was rated for 2.5-6.5 hours, though later revisions upped that figure significantly. The company cautions that "this time is an estimate ... battery life will depend on the games you play and usage conditions." Nintendo is hosting a worldwide roadshow to let gamers go hands-on with the console. These events started in New York and Paris on April 4-6, with others taking place throughout the following two months. Ticket registration for many of the Nintendo Switch 2 Experience events has closed, but waitlists are available. However, given that Nintendo is taking a first come, first served approach, your chances of attending the roadshow if you don't already have a ticket (or unless you signed up for the waitlist immediately) seem very small at this point. The full list of Nintendo Switch 2 Experience dates is as follows: North America: New York, April 4-6, 2025 Los Angeles, April 11-13, 2025 Dallas, April 25-27, 2025 Toronto, April 25-27, 2025 Europe: Paris, April 4-6, 2025 London, April 11-13, 2025 Milan, April 25-27, 2025 Berlin, April 25-27, 2025 Madrid, May 9-11, 2025 Amsterdam, May 9-11, 2025 Oceania: Melbourne, May 10-11, 2025 Asia: Tokyo (Makuhari), April 26-27, 2025 Seoul, May 31-June 1, 2025 Hong Kong, To be announced Taipei, To be announced Nintendo confirmed in November 2024 that the Nintendo Switch 2 will be backwards compatible. It will also feature access to Nintendo Online, so users will be able to play all of those old retro titles. In the initial Nintendo Switch 2 press release, Nintendo reiterated that physical and digital Switch games will work on the new system. However, it noted that "certain Nintendo Switch games may not be supported on or fully compatible with Nintendo Switch 2." We now have more information on which games are working thanks to a guide Nintendo put together. As of April 1, the vast majority of Switch 2 games are marked as compatible, but many popular games are said to have some issues. Nintendo has marked most of these as “under investigation,” suggesting a fix may be on the way in time for launch. Nintendo says it is manually testing every Switch game for compatibility. Only one title is marked as incompatible: Nintendo Labo Toy-Con 04: VR Kit. This was part of Nintendo’s Labo range of games that worked with Cardboard accessories, and is incompatible as the Switch 2 doesn’t physically fit in the VR headset. The original Switch has, to put it mildly, struggled to run some of the late-generation software that's come down the pike. Could these games be enhanced to take advantage of the increased horsepower of the Switch 2? That’s unclear. In an “Ask the Developer” page on its site, Nintendo says that old games are working through a real-time translation system, which sounds similar to how Rosetta allows modern Macs to run old software. With that said, the new and old Switch are much closer in hardware than that. In the same developer interview, it’s said that in its testing of old games for compatibility, there were some occasions “where loading times became faster, or game performance became more stable,” but we don’t have any detail beyond that. As well as backward compatibility, Nintendo is also offering up premium "Switch 2 Edition" upgrades for a select few games. These have improved resolutions and frame rates, and (in some cases) bonus features and content. What exactly that means will vary, but Nintendo did confirm that Metroid Prime 4: Beyond will have 4K/60 fps and 1080p/120 fps options on the Switch 2. Games confirmed to have a Switch 2 Edition to date include: Super Mario Party Jamboree The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Kirby and the Forgotten Land Pokémon Legends: Z-A Metroid Prime 4: Beyond In the case of the two mainline Zelda games, those upgrades will be included with a Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership or cost $10 each. Upgrades for the other games are also paid, but Nintendo has not said how much those will cost. You may remember that the original Switch cartridges taste absolutely awful. This was on purpose, to discourage folks from putting the games in their mouth. Similarly, the Switch 2 carts are also said to taste terrible, in large part to stop children or pets from accidentally ingesting them. It is not yet clear what substance Nintendo has coated the Switch 2 cartridges in to make them taste foul, but Nintendo's Takuhiro Dohta advised against licking them all the same. "We don't want anybody to be at risk of any unwanted consumption," he told GameSpot . "We have indeed made it so that if it enters your mouth, you'll spit it out." We expect this list to change substantially over the coming weeks and months, but the titles currently confirmed to be available on day one follow: Arcade Archives 2 Ridge Racer Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD Remaster Cyberpunk 2077 Deltarune Fast Fusion Fortnite Hitman: World of Assassination Hogwarts Legacy Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess Mario Kart World Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S Split Fiction Street Fighter 6 Survival Kids Yakuza 0: Director's Cut That's everything we know about the Nintendo Switch 2 today.
