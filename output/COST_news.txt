Title: Why The Kroger-Albertsons Merger Was Blocked

Atlanta, Georgia, Kroger. (Photo by: Jeffrey Greenberg/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) A Federal Judge and a King County Judge in Washington state have blocked the $25 billion merger of grocery giants Kroger and Albertsons. The decision is a victory for consumers, grocery workers, smaller-scale suppliers and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The FTC successfully argued that the merger would raise prices by eliminating competition and weaken union bargaining power. Kroger and Albertsons countered that they needed to merge to compete with Walmart, Costco and Amazon, and that selling off 579 stores would preserve competition after the merger. The resulting grocery behemoth would have over 5,000 stores. The two companies spent close to $1 billion to push the merger through, money that maybe could have instead gone towards lowering grocery prices. The Institute for Local Self Reliance, which opposed the merger, stated, “This historic ruling marks the first time that the government has blocked a supermarket merger in decades. It shows that the administration's push to reinvigorate our antitrust laws is succeeding, including, crucially, in the courts.” A group of UFCW local unions (UFCW 7, 324, 400, 770, 1564 and 3000) leading the Stop the Merger coalition, also put out a statement, “The well-reasoned decisions today by both Courts make plain what union grocery workers have known all along – this mega-merger would be bad for workers who deserve a workplace where they can be paid well for their labor, be safe and be respected. It would be disastrous for shoppers who deserve competition that leads to better choices and lower prices. The merger would be detrimental to our communities, would harm farmers and suppliers who deserve a healthy balance to negotiate fair prices for their hard work.” The top 6 chains control 65% of grocery retail sales nationally, the top 4 over 50%. Walmart alone controls nearly 30% nationally and over 50% in many regions. Kroger and Albertsons own dozens of regional banners that millions of people shop in daily. Kroger owns Fred Meyer, QFC, Harris Teeter, Vitacost, Smith’s, Ralph’s and King Soopers, and others, while Albertsons owns Jewel-Osco, Safeway, Vons, Pavilion, Acme, King’s, Shaw’s, Tom Thumb and Randalls and others. LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - AUGUST 26: The Albertsons logo is displayed at an Albertsons supermarket ... [+] on August 26, 2024 in Los Angeles, California. A federal judge in Oregon is hearing arguments today after the Federal Trade Commission and several states sued to block the planned merger between grocery chains Kroger and Albertsons. (Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images) Kroger or Albertsons are the No.1, 2 or 3 market share leader in almost every metro area they operate in, such as: This retail consolidation among a handful of chains enables concentration further back in the supply chain, especially in CPG, or consumer packaged goods. The top 4 yogurt companies, including Danone, Lactalis and Chobani, control 75% of sales and the top 3 cereal companies, including General Mills, Post and Kellogg’s, control 90% of your crunchy breakfast options. Four or fewer corporations also control 93% of soda sales, including Coke and Pepsi, 80% of candy, such as Hershey, Mondelez and Mars, 60% of snack bars, including Mars, Kellanova and General Mills, 66% of frozen pizza, 60% of bread, 80% of toothpaste and 80% of toilet paper sales. Such retail and CPG concentration supercharged the price inflation that in turn created windfall profits from 2020-2022. Inflation was not demand-driven, as some economists have suggested. Overall grocery prices are up over 30%, while unit volumes are actually flat or down since 2019: The Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine created ample consumer concerns to give cover fire for companies up and down the supply chain to pass prices to consumers above the rate of their own cost inflation. These practices, called “sellers inflation” by economist Isabella Weber, may have contributed to over 50% of all food price inflation from 2020-2022. In that timeframe, Walmart raised prices on thousands of items well above the rate of inflation, including potato chips by 35%, cookies by 62% and yogurt by 92%. Prices at Albertsons on store brand oils increased by 117%, potato chips by 68% and packaged cheese by 125%. MILL VALLEY, CALIFORNIA - JULY 27: Customers leave a Safeway. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty ... [+] Images) Kroger, Albertsons, Target and Dollar General all saw double-digit net income growth from 2020-2021. In 2020, Walmart and Kroger saw windfall profits as the economy shut down, adding $45 billion to the Walton family wealth and 2 billion dollar rounds of Kroger stock buybacks. During the Kroger-Albertsons merger trials, lots of information was revealed to add fuel to these concerns, as documented by Laurel Kilgour of the American Economic Liberties Project: Lina Khan meme. Blocking such an enormous merger is a brief victory for antitrust and labor advocates. It is a small step considering the challenges for the grocery industry beyond market concentration and higher prices, such as bird flu, climate change, the huge cost externalities from unhealthy food, as well as poverty wages and retail food deserts. Instead, the future could be a grocery industry with diversified ownership and governance, that prioritizes worker welfare and their standards of living, and that reflects a true cost accounting, transitioning towards diversified, regenerative and organic production. Such a sustainable and economic populism should not just be wishful thinking. Like blocking such massive grocery mergers, it should be common sense. One Community. Many Voices.

Data source: Google Finance Key Metrics: Microsoft continues to dominate the enterprise software market while rapidly expanding its cloud and AI capabilities. The company's Azure cloud platform has grown to command 24% of the global cloud infrastructure market, while its AI integration across products has created new revenue streams. Microsoft stands out as a top pick for January 2025 due to its exceptional financial performance and market dominance. In the fourth quarter of 2024, the company reported revenue of $62.5 billion, up 18% year over year, with Azure cloud services growing at 28%. Microsoft's AI services generated $3.2 billion in revenue, representing a 165% increase from the previous year. The company's operating margins expanded to 42%, leading to a record free cash flow of $25.7 billion for the quarter. With $145 billion in cash and a debt-to-equity ratio of just 0.35, Microsoft has ample resources for continued investment in growth initiatives and potential acquisitions. The company's forward P/E of 35x, while not cheap, is justified by its projected earnings growth rate of 15% annually through 2027 and its leadership position in enterprise AI adoption, where spending is expected to reach $150 billion by 2025. Key Metrics: UnitedHealth Group combines the largest private health insurance business in the US with its rapidly growing Optum healthcare services division. The company serves more than 50 million members and continues to innovate in healthcare delivery and cost management. UnitedHealth's appeal lies in its consistent growth and expanding healthcare services ecosystem. The company's Optum division grew revenues by 25% to $56.3 billion in fourth-quarter 2024, with operating margins improving to 8.9%. The insurance segment maintains a stable medical care ratio of 82.1%, indicating effective cost management. UnitedHealth added 2.2 million new members in 2024, bringing its total to 52.5 million, while revenue per consumer increased by 8%. The company's investment in digital health technologies has reduced administrative costs by $2.1 billion annually. Trading at a forward P/E of 32x, below the S&P 500 average, UNH offers value given its projected 13% earnings growth rate and dominant market position in an expanding healthcare sector expected to grow 8% annually through 2028.

Key Metrics: Visa maintains its position as the world's largest payment processor, benefiting from the ongoing shift to digital payments and cross-border transaction growth. The company's network processes over 185 billion transactions annually. Visa's compelling investment case is strengthened by its exceptional financial metrics and growth trajectory. The company processed $3.1 trillion in payment volume in fourth-quarter 2024, up 16% year over year, while cross-border volumes surged 22% as international travel recovered. Operating margins reached an impressive 67%, leading to $4.8 billion in quarterly net income. Visa's return on invested capital of 45% demonstrates its capital efficiency, while its network of 80 million merchant locations provides a strong moat. The company's investments in new payment technologies, including $1.2 billion in blockchain and real-time payment solutions, positions it well for future growth. Trading at a forward P/E of 28.6x, Visa offers reasonable value given its projected 15% annual earnings growth and 54% net income margins. Key Metrics: Costco continues to excel in retail with its membership-based model, offering high-quality products at competitive prices. The company's focus on customer value and operational efficiency has driven consistent growth in both sales and membership. Costco's appeal as a top pick is reinforced by its stellar operational metrics and growth initiatives. The company's membership renewal rate reached a record 93%, while membership fee income grew 8.5% to $4.2 billion annually. same-store sales growth of 5.2% outpaced major retailers, while e-commerce sales surged 15%. Costco's international expansion continues with 28 new warehouses planned for 2025, including 10 in Asia where average store productivity is 15% higher than U.S. locations. The company's private label Kirkland brand reached $65 billion in annual sales, growing 12% year over year and providing higher margins. Despite a seemingly high forward P/E of 59x, Costco's price-to-membership-fee ratio of 17x and consistent double-digit earnings growth justify the premium valuation. Key Metrics: Devon Energy has established itself as a leader in U.S. shale production, with premium assets in the Delaware Basin. The company's variable dividend policy returns significant cash to shareholders while maintaining operational flexibility. Devon Energy's attractiveness stems from its operational efficiency and shareholder-friendly policies. The company's Delaware Basin operations achieved a 45% return on capital at $70 oil prices, while production costs decreased 8% year-over-year. A free cash flow yield of 12% supports the company's variable dividend policy, which returned $4.3 billion to shareholders in 2024. Devon's debt-to-Ebitda ratio of 0.8x is among the lowest in the industry, providing flexibility for opportunistic acquisitions or additional shareholder returns. The company's hedging program locks in profitable prices for 60% of 2025 production, reducing downside risk. Trading at just 12.4x forward earnings with a 5.8% variable dividend yield, Devon offers significant value in an energy sector that remains critical to global economic growth. My top stock picks for January 2025 represent a diverse mix of market leaders with strong competitive positions and growth potential. Microsoft leads in technology and AI, UnitedHealth Group dominates healthcare, Visa benefits from digital payments growth, Costco shows retail resilience, and Devon Energy offers value and income. While past performance doesn't guarantee future results, these companies' strong fundamentals and market positions make them compelling investments for the current market environment.

Title: This mid-range gaming laptop feels like the forgotten middle child, and isn't difficult to understand why
URL: https://www.windowscentral.com/hardware/lenovo/lenovo-legion-5i-gen-9-review
Time Published: 2024-12-10T15:00:00Z

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The Lenovo Legion 5i (Gen 9) feels extremely familiar to other mid-range Legion laptops of the last few years in that it's unapologetically 'chonky,' but still delivers reliably excellent gaming performance in a reassuringly sturdy chassis. It certainly doesn't wow outside of being a gaming laptop, but more odd is how forgotten this laptop feels in the current Legion lineup (and how surprisingly difficult it was to track down where you can buy one). Sturdy, practical design with healthy port selection Excellent gaming performance and thermal management Comfortable and responsive keyboard Attractive pricing, especially with frequent sales Feels oddly placed between the Legion Slim 5i and Legion Pro 5i laptops Definitely not suited for anything outside gaming and graphically intensive work Why you can trust Windows Central Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test. The Lenovo Legion line of gaming hardware and accessories has continually expanded over the years to the point where Lenovo even created the new LOQ brand specifically for its budget gaming devices. • Pricing & specs• Design & build quality• Display quality• Performance & thermals• Battery experience• Keyboard & everything else• Competition• Score card & final thoughts That's been great for giving customers choices, and Lenovo has become a very reliable recommendation for those seeking a straightforward, dependable gaming laptop. The Lenovo Legion 5 line dominates the mid-range category, and the Legion 5i (Gen 9) I've been testing sits in the middle of that family. It's a familiar experience with a practical and hefty design, excellent gaming performance, and reasonable pricing. It'd be an easy recommendation, except it awkwardly sits between the longer-lasting Legion Slim 5i and the more powerful Legion Pro 5i like the neglected middle child — and if you do some shopping, you'll notice that Lenovo and retailers alike are far more likely to recommend the Slim and Pro variants to you than this one — even if I'd sooner suggest this laptop before its Pro big sibling. This review was made possible thanks to a review sample provided by Lenovo. The company had no input nor saw the contents of this review prior to publication. • Price: ~$1,609.99-$1,949.99 at Lenovo• Display: 16-inch IPS LCD, 16:10 aspect ratio, QHD+ (2,560 x 1,600) resolution, 165Hz refresh rate, 350nits max brightness, anti-glare coating, non-touch, Dolby Vision HDR support, NVIDIA G-SYNC support• CPU: Intel Core i9-14900HX (24 cores, 32 threads, up to 5.8GHz)• GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 (8GB DDR6)• NPU: None (Lenovo LA1 chip for Lenovo AI Engine+ support)• RAM: 32GB DDR5 @ 5,600MHz (2x 16GB, SODIMM)• Storage: 1TB M.2 2280 NVMe PCIe Gen 4x4 SSD• Battery: 80Whr, Rapid Charge Pro support w/ 230W adapter• Dimensions: 359.7 x 262.3 x 19.7-25.2mm (14.16 x 10.33 x 0.78-0.99in)• Weight: 2.36kg (5.2lbs) Pricing and availability for the Lenovo Legion 5i (Gen 9) are odd, to say the least. Most retailers you'd first go to for all your laptop buying needs aren't likely to offer this laptop at all (Best Buy selling both the Slim and Pro variants is a great example of this), and even Lenovo sells few pre-configured models and somewhat limits your choices in its custom configurator. The only shop I could find my exact review configuration was Costco, of all places. That's alright, though, because the Intel Core i9 inside my unit seems a little overkill when paired with the rest of the internals. The most affordable Legion 5i (Gen 9) straight from the source is $1,120.99 at Lenovo (at least at the time of writing), which gets you a Core i7-14650HX, RTX 4060, 16GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD in a well-specced, balanced mid-range gaming laptop. The Lenovo Legion 5i custom configurator starts from $1,239.99 at Lenovo at the time of writing, giving you more options but costing you a little more across the board. Either way, the Lenovo Legion 5i (Gen 9) consistently costs less than the Legion Pro 5i, with the only differences being a gently more compact design, barely different port selection, and slightly worse overall performance. In the box, you'll find the Lenovo Legion 5i (Gen 9), a proprietary 230W DC charger and adapter, a 3-month subscription for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, and a replaceable rear vent plate with a blue accent color (versus the default flat grey). Lenovo Legion 5i (Gen 9) — Buy now at Lenovo ($1,120.99 at time of writing) This variant of the Lenovo Legion 5i is powered by an Intel Core i7-14650HX, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060, 16GB of RAM, and 1TB of SSD storage. At the time of this review Lenovo lists this with a ridiculous retail price of $1,789.99, but the discounted $1,120.99 is an excellent price for this laptop. 👉See at: Lenovo.com If you've seen one Lenovo Legion laptop in the last few years, you've essentially seen them all. Sure, there have been refinements and improvements made over the years, but Legion devices have remained remarkably consistent over time. The Legion 5i is like the Legion Pro 5i and Legion Slim 5i — it makes no attempt at being the thinnest or lightest gaming laptop. This is just a really practical design that feels incredibly durable and reliable. The Legion 5i is actually thinner (~25.2 vs. ~26.8mm) and lighter (2.36 vs. 2.5kg) than the Legion Pro 5i and puts all of its vents on the rear and bottom. This means your ports are more spread out, but overall, it's a very similar configuration. You get one USB Type-C 3.2 Gen 2 port with 140W Power Delivery and DisplayPort 1.4, a second USB Type-C 3.2 Gen 2 port with DisplayPort 1.4, three USB Type-A 3.2 Gen 1 ports (one is always on), and HDMI 2.1 port that supports up to 4K at 120Hz or 8K at 60Hz, an RJ45 Ethernet port, a microSD card reader, and a 3.5mm audio jack. For comparison, the Legion Pro 5i loses the microSD card reader but gains a fourth USB Type-A port. Finally, there's the familiar 230W DC charging port, which supports up to 300W for more powerful configurations. The Lenovo Legion 5i feels familiar once again when you look at its display. It's the same panel across the entire Legion 5 lineup, actually (with the exception of an optional 240Hz configuration), meaning you're looking at 16 inches of QHD+ (2,560 x 1,600), 165Hz IPS LCD goodness. This display isn't likely to wow you at any point, but it's solid across the board and offers reliable, smooth performance when gaming. 99% of the sRGB and 78% of the DCI-P3 color gamuts means you shouldn't rely on this display for any creative work, but this display is consistent. It gets decently bright, its contrast ratios are good for an IPS LCD panel, and its white balance, while warm, is level across all brightness levels. Dolby Vision HDR support is also technically here, but this isn't a screen I'd rely on to consume high-quality HDR content. When gaming, this display is smooth and responsive, with NVIDIA G-SYNC support putting a halt to potential screen tearing. Performance is where you'll most wonder if you really need to spring for the more expensive Lenovo Legion Pro 5i, as the Legion 5i (Gen 9) boasts many of the same configuration options and is able to perform admirably with that hardware. Its only real flaw is that these fans are extremely loud, enough that the speakers aren't quite enough to drown them out. You'll want a headset for gaming. With the same CPU, GPU, RAM, SSD, and display options, it's hard at first glance to see the difference between the Lenovo Legion 5i (Gen 9) and its more expensive Pro sibling. Really, it comes down to the Pro 5i having more thermal headroom due to its beefier chassis and being able to put a little more wattage into its components. On paper, this means the Legion Pro 5i is the more powerful laptop, and this is reflected in benchmarks. That doesn't make the Legion 5i slow, though. This laptop kept up with more expensive machines well, and in real-world performance and gaming, you're not liable to see much of a difference between the Legion 5i and the thicker, heavier Legion Pro 5i, including in gaming. Achieving stable 60 frames-per-second in most PC games at high settings is very reasonable with the Legion Pro 5i, and if you lower the resolution to 1080p (which will still look great on a 16-inch display), you can take better advantage of that 165Hz refresh rate. I also stress tested the Legion 5i's thermal management with 25 consecutive loops of 3DMark's Time Spy benchmark, and a 99.6% framerate stability proves this laptop's capable cooling system. The Lenovo Legion 5i (Gen 9) carries the same 80Whr battery cell as the Legion Pro 5i and Slim 5i, and its endurance sits in between the two. Lower wattage likely contributes to the Legion 5i outlasting its Pro sibling, but it can't compete with the efficiency of the AMD-powered Slim 5i, which is one of the longest-lasting Legion laptops. In Procyon's One Hour Battery Consumption tests, the Legion 5i drained 22% while simulating a standard Microsoft Office workload and 24% when looping an HD video at 50% volume. Around 3-4 hours of regular usage isn't unreasonable with the Legion 5i, but this is still far from a battery champion and not a laptop I'd recommend for mobile work. Once again, the Legion 5i is a familiar tale here. Wholly focused on its role as a gaming laptop, the Lenovo Legion 5i (Gen 9) simply isn't exciting or interesting in a lot of ways. The front-facing camera, microphones, and touchpad are all secondary on a gaming laptop, so they clearly didn't get much investment. The dual stereo speakers are also reminiscent of the "average" Windows laptop of a few years ago in that they're fine for YouTube videos or video calls, but you won't want to do much else with them. One feature a gaming laptop can't neglect is the keyboard, though, and Lenovo rarely misses here. The Legion 5i shares a keyboard with its siblings, this time with four-zone RGB lighting and a condensed tenkey number pad. It's a very solid keyboard with a comfortable and responsive action, excellent layout, full-sized arrow keys, and intelligent shortcuts and functions. I really can't complain here. As usual, there's no Windows Hello biometric authentication, but I'm not really docking the Legion 5i points for that. This is a mid-range gaming laptop, I don't expect it. I do expect excellent wireless performance, though, and the Legion 5i fares just fine on this front with Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.2 support. If you want a more stable connection, you can always use the Ethernet port. It shouldn't surprise you if you've read this review up until this point, but the Lenovo Legion Pro 5i (Gen 9) that we've reviewed is arguably this laptop's biggest competitor. It's not because the Legion Pro 5i is necessarily better; it's more powerful, but it's also bigger, heavier, and more expensive. It's largely because the Legion Pro 5i is more available, and unless you can find a Legion 5i configuration in stock and on sale for less than the equivalent Legion Pro 5i, then the Legion Pro 5i may end up the easier choice. You can also consider the Lenovo Legion Slim 5i (Gen 9). We haven't reviewed this laptop, but it's very similar in size and weight to the Legion 5i but with a tweaked design and an AMD CPU that focuses more on efficiency than raw power. This is the Legion 5 to choose if you want a pure gaming laptop that can also fare okay away from the charger for a few hours. As far as this price range is concerned, though, Lenovo's Legion line is going to be one of the more attractive options, and for good reason. ✅You want a focused, no-fuss gaming laptop on a budget The Lenovo Legion 5i is designed for one thing and one thing only: to game. Sure, it's a full-blown Windows laptop and can do all the normal PC things, too, but it's clearly built for those who aren't too concerned about that (and want to save some money on a new rig). ✅You can find it on sale for less than the Legion Pro 5i The Legion 5i should cost less than the Legion Pro 5i, but its spotty availability and odd pricing don't guarantee it. If you can find the Legion 5i in the configuration you want for a good bit less than the equivalent Legion Pro 5i, the Legion 5i will end up being the better laptop for most people. ❌You want a gaming laptop you can also take on the go Lenovo Legion laptops aren't known for being particularly portable or efficient, and the Legion 5i is no exception. This is a beefy laptop with a short-lived battery. Those who want a more mobile machine that can still game are better off looking at something like the ASUS ROG Zephyrus line (you'll be paying more, though). The Lenovo Legion 5i (Gen 9) is a bit of an odd laptop. To be frank, it would be the most obvious recommendation of Lenovo's mid-range gaming laptop lineup between the Legion Slim 5i (which isn't really slim at all) and the Legion Pro 5i (which barely feels "pro"), if it weren't for it being oddly... Hard to find. • Indiana Jones for Xbox• Razer Freyja cushion• iBuyPower Slate desktop• Lenovo Yoga Slim 7i Lenovo's habit of overpricing its devices at retail (only to frequently discount them soon after launch) returns here, but the Legion 5i also suffers from seemingly lower visibility and availability than the more expensive Legion Pro 5i. That laptop is just as good, and you're basically gaining more weight and size in exchange for slightly better performance and cooling, but it's also usually a couple of hundred dollars more expensive. If you can find the Lenovo Legion 5i at a discounted price that settles it below where you can find the equivalent Legion 5i Pro, I honestly suggest saving that money and getting this laptop instead. It's a gaming laptop through and through and won't win any awards outside of playing your favorite PC games, but the Lenovo Legion 5i (Gen 9) is a good gaming laptop at an attractive price, or around $1,120.99 at Lenovo for the configuration I'd recommend. The mid-range option in Lenovo's mid-range gaming laptop family, the Legion 5i (Gen 9) goes toe-to-toe with the more expensive Legion Pro 5i more often than not, while also usually costing a fair deal less. The only problem? Lenovo and retailers are far more likely to show you the Legion Pro 5i instead.

Following the Federal Reserve adopting a more optimistic stance and Bitcoin hitting a historic $100,000 milestone, this week carries a handful of key earnings reports, inflation data, and some events that could set the tone for 2025.
