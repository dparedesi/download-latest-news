As a contact lens-wearer for nearly two decades, I’ve learned that purchasing contacts online is both cheaper and more convenient than buying them at the optometrist’s office. Having purchased from 1-800 Contacts for a number of years, I named this retailer the best place to buy contacts online due to its incredible return policy (return any unused contacts, any time), Best Price Guarantee and friendly, accessible customer service. But, there are other contacts e-tailers deserving of accolades for their own reasons, like Hubble, my choice for a subscription-based service, and Warby Parker, ideal for lens-wearers who also d0n the company’s stylish frames. I consider 1-800 Contacts to be the best place to buy contacts overall thanks to its variety, Best ... [+] Price Guarantee and ridiculously generous return policy. When making a contacts purchase online, you’ll need a current prescription at the ready. Most sites let you upload a scan of your prescription then plug in your eye doctor information to be verified. While you cannot use an expired prescription to make a purchase as per the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)—and prescriptions are only good for one or two years, but it varies by state—many sites offer virtual exams for prescription renewals. Some of my favorite places to order contacts online offer this option, but I also evaluated e-tailers for variety, pricing, shipping and return policies, and whether they accept insurance and HSA or FSA funds. Below, see my top picks and how they fit your contacts-buying needs. 1-800 Contacts Shipping: Free standard shipping, plus expedited and one-day options | Return policy: Free returns and exchanges any time, including opened boxes | Insurance accepted: Yes, and accepts FSA and HSA | Virtual Rx renewal: Yes What you’ll love: Keep in mind: I’ve remained a 1-800-contacts customer for years because, second to purchasing from a reputable site, my priority is price. The company’s Best Price Guarantee offers assurance that you’ll score your lenses for the lowest market price; just contact customer service via the 24/7 live chat and show them a link to the same lower-priced product for verification. The process is relatively easy, save for a few qualifying factors—for instance, the competitor must be U.S.-based, and searching for an eligible price match can get time-consuming. (I explain more thoroughly in my full 1-800-Contacts review if you want to know more). So, if you want the lowest cost for your lenses up front without doing any legwork, this may not be the best retailer for you. Other features that earn the company top marks include its ExpressExam, a virtual prescription renewal that costs $20, its fast free shipping and its generous return policy: You can return unused contacts at any time (somehow, I always have more dailies left for my right eye…)—even if you purchased them from another retailer. And, if you need specs, you can shop frames from its house brand, Liingo. Ultimately, 1-800-Contacts has earned its reputation for stellar and accessible customer service, and in my experience, I’ve always found its reps to be accommodating, helpful and incredibly friendly. Hubble Shipping: $4 standard shipping (plus any applicable sales tax) | Return policy: Return unopened boxes within 14 days for a refund, less shipping and handling | Insurance accepted: No, but accepts HSA and FSA | Virtual Rx renewal: Yes, free for subscribers What you’ll love: Keep in mind: It’s no secret that contact lenses are expensive, and Hubble’s monthly subscription model helps lessen up-front costs while keeping you stocked up. If you’re not stuck on a brand and want the most bang for your buck, check out Hubble’s line of lenses, which range from $23 to $30 per month, per eye. They include Hubble, the namesake line that features affordable dailies; Hydro for extra dry eyes; and SkyHy, the most breathable option. If you’re considering switching brands, though, the FTC states you may need a new prescription unless it’s “a generic or store brand version of the same lens” recommended by your doc. Hubble also has offerings from Acuvue, Bausch + Lomb and Biotrue, but that’s the extent of its third-party offerings. For hesitant first-timer subscribers, the e-tailer’s initial promos are hard to beat, starting as low as $1 per eye for the Hubble Classic Daily 10-day starter pack—shipping included. Another boon is its virtual vision tests for prescription renewals, which is free for subscribers. While many well-known online contacts lens retailers offer auto-ship or subscription options, Hubble’s biggest defining factor is its overall cost friendliness, if you don’t mind the lack of brand variety. Just keep in mind that each order costs $4 in shipping, plus any additional taxes, if applicable. GlassesUSA Shipping: Free standard shipping, plus expedited and express options | Return policy: Free returns and exchanges of unopened boxes within 60 days | Insurance accepted: Yes, and accepts FSA and HSA | Virtual Rx renewal: No What you’ll love: Keep in mind: As far as variety and a straightforward user experience, GlassesUSA is a well-known eyewear retailer and one-stop shop for glasses, sunglasses and of course, contact lenses. Further, it offers a multitude of options in each category. When shopping for contacts, you can easily search by brand, lens type, prescription type (single-vision, multifocal, astigmatism, etc.), budget and more, and there’s an Auto-Refill option at checkout. The company also accepts insurance, and while its Price Match Guarantee isn’t as outwardly advertised as others, it will honor lower competitor pricing (and reimburse you the difference if it’s within three days of your purchase). One thing the site lacks, though, is a virtual prescription renewal feature. This is a great place to shop if you’re big into browsing sales and coupons; the site is transparent with discounts and has an easy-to-find sale section and coupon page. And because GlassesUSA specializes in, well, glasses, you can take advantage of promotions across different types of eyewear, like free glasses worth up to $150 with your first shipment of contacts. Contacts Direct Shipping: Free standard shipping and store pickup at LensCrafters, plus priority and express options | Return policy: Return unopened boxes within 6 months for a refund, less shipping charges | Insurance accepted: Yes, and accepts HSA and FSA | Virtual Rx renewal: Yes What you’ll love: Keep in mind: While many other contact lens retailers accept insurance, and more frequently HSA and FSA funds, ContactsDirect makes cashing in on these benefits especially easy. The company’s insurance policy page outlines accepted carriers as well as info on out-of-network vision plans, and you can speak with customer service reps via live chat or phone if you need help or have questions. Plus, savings is not exclusive to insurance holders: Visit its savings page for info on promos, including 15% off all orders with code MYCONTACTS plus a standard 15% off for military members, teachers, government workers, first responders, and hospital and medical workers. ContactsDirect also does price matching, but only with a select list of competitors (including Walgreens and Costco). Selection-wise, this site offers all the major brands and varieties, including specialty lenses like multifocals or those for astigmatism. You can also get your prescription renewed online for $19—which is $10 off—with code VISION10. Contact Lens King Shipping: $10 to $13 for standard US shipping, plus priority and expedited options | Return policy: Return unopened boxes within 30 days for a refund, less shipping charges | Insurance accepted: No, but accepts HSA and FSA | Virtual Rx renewal: No What you’ll love: Keep in mind: Before you get too excited about Contact Lens King’s low pricing, it’s important to note that shipping is quite steep at $10 to $13 for standard domestic shipping. So if you’re only ordering, say, two to four boxes of lenses and break down the cost, you’re probably not be saving much. (Yes, I’ve done that math.) However, if you typically order a larger supply of six-plus boxes, the savings adds up. And while you may see lower cost-per-box options on other sites, beware of excessive hidden fees that are tacked on in cart. Otherwise, Contact Lens King offers a pretty standard experience when it comes to shopping for contacts online, including ample brand and lens variety (with options for astigmatism and colored contacts), the acceptance of HSA and FSA funds (but not insurance) and accessible help via phone or live chat. You won’t find extra features like virtual prescription renewals here, but you will find transparent pricing that will save you cash if you buy in bulk. Warby Parker Shipping: Free standard shipping, plus expedited option | Return policy: Free returns and exchanges of unopened boxes within 60 days of receipt| Insurance accepted: Yes, and accepts HSA and FSA | Virtual Rx renewal: Yes What you’ll love: Keep in mind: Warby Parker’s claim to fame is its affordable line of stylish frames that start at $95. It’s also known for its Home Try-On program that lets you test five pairs for free before making your purchase. Now, it also offers a large selection of contact lenses including its value house brand called Scout, which you can sample at no cost. While the company offers convenient and cost-saving perks like competitive pricing, free shipping and virtual prescription renewals, and it accepts insurance, HSA and FSA funds, these incentives aren’t necessarily unique. But for fans of Warby Parker’s frames—especially frequent buyers, or those who alternate regularly between glasses and lenses—you can get all your eyewear and have your prescription info saved at a single destination. (Don’t forget, the brand offers a line of sunglasses, too.) Further, you can take advantage of cross-product savings like a $50 eyewear credit when you buy an annual supply of contacts. Walgreens Shipping: Free standard shipping on contact lens-only orders, plus overnight option | Return policy: Returns accepted in unopened boxes, with some exceptions | Insurance accepted: No, but accepts HSA and FSA | Virtual Rx renewal: No What you’ll love: Keep in mind: Unlike shopping through an eyewear site, Walgreens doesn’t offer vision-specific features like a virtual try-on option or extra-lenient return policy. However, making a purchase through the drugstore giant means competitive pricing and promos, a “ship to store option” and the ability to throw additional essentials into your cart. (And it’s especially convenient if you regularly shop on the Walgreens site, anyway.) Shipping is free on contact lens-only orders, and if you’re getting a mix of items, it’s free on purchases over $35. In the virtual contact lens “aisle,” you’ll find a wide selection at competitive prices, plus you can take advantage of stacked-on savings—right now, all contact lens orders are an extra 25% off with code CYBER25. The limited return policy allows you to return unopened boxes by mail if the order was incorrect, the product is defective or damaged, or you ordered the wrong prescription, and the lenses must still be in stock and unexpired. You can also use HSA and FSA funds to pay for your order. At Forbes Vetted, we’ve researched, tested and written a wide catalog of eyewear stories and roundups of the best personal care products on the market. The editors involved in writing, researching and editing this piece are contact lens-wearers and know what to look for when choosing an e-tailer for eyewear needs. As I compared popular retailers, I investigated inventory variety, shipping and return policies, and insurance and HSA and FSA eligibility. I also factored in virtual prescription renewals and customer service helpfulness, which contribute to the overall shopping experience. Shopping for contacts online is often more convenient and cost-effective than buying them at the optometrist’s office. That said, additional steps like uploading your prescription and shopping around for the best price can take some time. Here are the top things to consider when narrowing down contact lens e-tailers. If you’re already committed to a specific product, first make sure the retailer you’re considering has it in stock. This is especially true for specialty lenses, like those designed for astigmatism. If you’re not stuck on a particular brand, some eyewear companies offer value brand lenses; check out Aquasoft Dailies at 1-800 Contacts, Scout by Warby Parker and Hubble’s line of lenses. Just note, you may need a new prescription to switch brands, according to the FTC website. However, “You don’t need your prescriber’s approval to switch brands if a manufacturer offers a brand name and a generic or store brand version of the same lens,” it says. A big differentiating factor between many of our top contenders is the shopping experience, and each retailer caters to different needs. Consider whether you want the option to renew your prescription online, buy glasses and contacts in the same place, order (and save) in bulk, or receive a monthly delivery by subscription; we’ve included e-tailers that offer these conveniences and more. While many retailers offer free shipping, some still charge, so you’ll want to factor that into the overall price of your order. Hubble’s monthly subscription orders come with a $4 ship fee, but the model is helpful for those who don’t want to purchase a bunch of contacts up front; Contact Lens King’s ship fees are on the higher side starting at $10 to $13, but its low cost-per-box prices offer savings on larger orders. You want to be mindful of return policies as well, noting eligibility for return timeframes as well as product condition (for example, most e-tailers only accept returns of unopened boxes in original packaging). Further, some companies won’t reimburse you for shipping costs. If you prioritize a generous return policy, 1-800 Contacts has no time limit for returns, and you can send back any unused contacts, even if you’ve opened the box. You’ll find that pricing differs from one retailer to the next, but buyer beware: If you see a product with exceptionally low pricing, there’s a good chance that hidden fees, like excessive “processing” fees, will be added in cart, or the after-rebate price is being advertised (meaning you have to pay the full amount up front). E-tailers with price match guarantees like 1-800 Contacts, ContactsDirect and GlassesUSA give you added peace of mind if you find a lower price elsewhere. Plus, you can often take advantage of promotions for more savings at checkout. Buying your contacts online is just as safe as buying them in person, as long as you purchase from a reputable seller. All of our recommended websites feature the same brands of contacts that you’d find at an optical shop, including Acuvue and Bausch & Lomb. The main difference is that contacts purchased online are often less expensive than ones bought in a store. While your eye doctor’s office can offer rebate options, online contacts suppliers get lenses directly from manufacturers, skipping steps that add extra costs for you. Plus, they have access to massive warehouses, which allows them to give steeper discounts than you’d find at the doctor’s office. Further, several eyewear e-tailers offer price matching, meaning if you find your preferred contacts cheaper elsewhere, they’ll match (or beat) that price. This is the reason many people prefer buying contacts online—in addition to the convenience factor. No, you need to have a valid, current prescription from an eye doctor to purchase contacts online, as per the Federal Trade Commission. It also explains that prescription length varies by state, but is usually one to two years. If your prescription has expired and setting up an optometrist appointment is too much of a hassle, certain retailers allow you to renew your prescription from home with a virtual vision test. For example, 1-800 Contacts offers an ExpressExam feature that costs $20 and takes about 10 minutes to complete.

Introduction to Bitcoin Lecture Video Super pumped to share with you, my first full length lecture on an introduction to bitcoin, the bitcoin Revolution, and also this edited transcript that I provided for you! What to become: STOIC VLOG Something I have been meaning to write or create or do is like some sort of book, ebook, pamphlet, or introductory primer to stoicism. I really think that stoicism is probably one of the most useful and philosophical models to live normal every day real life. Yet, I haven’t really found a good instructional guide on it, especially when I was self teaching it to myself. Consider this a practical primer, cutting through the BS: Stoicism, stoic, the stoa in ancient Greece– essentially the stoa was like some sort of portico, patio, pillar, outside, essentially a spot where guys would just hang out, talk shop, talk philosophy, etc. ￼ ￼ I think about the show “Hey Arnold” in which I was raised with… the notion of “stoop kid“, the notion of a stoop is that in a lot of cities, especially the east coast in New York, you have this little stoop or porch, stairs that go outside your front door… and you could just hang out there, engage in social and neighborhood life etc. One of my happiest moments was when I was living in Providence Rhode Island, and then COVID-19 hit. Everything was closed, besides the park. I can still go to the park, hang out, workout, do chin ups– I learned how to do muscle ups, more bodyweight calisthenics stuff, and also… I had a lot of fun with this “rock toss“ challenge and workout… in the middle of the park was a huge ass rock and huge ass stone, and every single day I would go there pick it up, and then eventually work out with it; throwing it around for fun, doing overhead presses with it, clean and jerks, squats, and eventually I would just throw it around for fun. Funny enough it might have been the most fit I was in my life… this was the true “functional” fitness. The inspiration — Hector lifting an insanely massive stone (barely 2 strong men could lift it)… using it to break down the door of the ships of the other side. Anyways, the reason why that period of covid was so good is that it was in the middle of beautiful Providence Rhode Island summer, so nice and bright and warm and lovely… and one of the good things was going to the park was like an open forum, a new anatheum for a lot of really cool guys to come, hang out, talk shop, go topless and shirtless, workout and hang out. I met some really interesting people during that period of time. I met some guys who were really cool. For example, one guy I met was in the US military Navy, I think he was training to be a Navy seal or Delta force or something. Another guy in some sort of ROTC training, another cool guy from the hood, and also I would say I probably met half a dozen friendly drug dealers there. And of course a lot of people who believed in conspiracy theories; really friendly, a little weird, but overall good guys. Anyways, one of the biggest benefits of hanging out at that outdoor park, open air, nothing but green grass, the beautiful sun and the fitness equipment was that I think having this sort of open air environment is actually very conducive to socializing, thinking and thought, and pro social behavior. My theory about a lot of modern day antisocial behavior has to do with the structures which enclose us. For example, almost universally most guys at the gym are extremely antisocial. Why? My theory is that because most gyms have closed, cramped narrow ceilings, and do not have access to natural light, or outside space. Cramped indoor spaces promote antisocial behavior. The only good gym I went to which was interesting was the golds gym in Venice, which has this really big outdoor workout area. I think this is much more natural and more fun and better; to be able to work out directly outside outdoors, with your shirt off. Stoics, stoicism — it was originally I think codified by this guy named Zeno, and over time he picked up some followers. Essentially the whole thing happened organically; Zeno would first share his thinking on philosophy ethics and pragmatic ways to deal with other people and the downsides of life, he built a following, and then his followers would propagate the thoughts and start their own little schools of thoughts, their own little stoic clubs. Would I like about stoicism is how loosey goosey it is. It is kind of like zen, or taoism… it is not really quantified as a religion, or a strict moral order. In fact, a lot of the ancients stoics would meditate on random stuff like cosmology, natural sciences like Seneca, how volcanoes worked or whatever. I think nowadays in today’s world, we focus primarily on the pragmatic side; how to deal with fear, uncertainty, downsides etc. ￼I think I might’ve first learned about stoicism from Nassim Taleb and his ANTIFRAGILE book. I was curious, and my curiosity went to deep. To quote NASSIM TALEB and the Venetian saying “The ocean goes deeper, the deeper you wade into it.” I literally consumed every single book I could find on stoicism, even the obscure ones. Funny enough, a lot of the stoic thinkers tried to claim other philosophers as being stoic, like Seneca did with Diogenes the cynic. ￼ Cynic, cynicism, actually comes from the word canine, the dog. Diogenes was considered the “dog” philosopher, first used as a pejorative, but ultimately Diogenes reappropriated that title for fun! He saw dogs as tough, almost like wild wolves, rather than seeing them as a negative thing. Even Achilles when he was raging against king Agamemnon, he called him “dog faced“ as a heaping insult. First, Seneca. Seneca the younger, his dad was called Seneca the elder. In fact, this is such a big deal because Cindy and I named our first son, Seneca, directly after the stoic philosopher. This is true soul in the game; if you name your kid after your favorite philosopher, certainly it is a sign that you really liked that philosopher, or found them impactful. ￼￼￼The reason why I really like Seneca the stoic philosopher is because he had real connections to real reality. What that means is he wasn’t just on the sidelines; he actually existed in the real world, engaged in real politics, was even advisor to the emperor Nero, the bad one, who eventually low-key coerced Seneca to commit suicide, in a manly, dignified manner. I think this was because maybe… there was actually a plan to overthrow Nero, and essentially Nero found out. ￼ I really like Seneca because his writing is accessible, practical and pragmatic, and interesting. A lot of thinkers tend to lack connections to real reality, I have no tolerance for boring philosophers to talk about metaphysics, which is things which are not physical. Like thoughts ideas, the universe, electricity and energy, strange phenomenon and conspiracy theories on ghosts, “energy” whatever. ￼￼For a long time, I would hear the term “metaphysics” being thrown around, and I had zero idea what it actually meant. ￼ Meta– on top of. Or nestled within. Physics — the physical, physical phenomenon like gravity, first principles. The reason why metaphysics philosophers tend to be a bunch of losers is that they are all weak and anemic, nerds or geeks or weaklings who seem to have some sort of physiological degeneracy, which encourages them to opine or talk or think about impractical things, superficial things. Personally speaking, I think philosophy must be practical. ￼￼￼￼ Practical, praxis, ￼practice — to do! I have a very funny ideal; the general idea is that your body looks like a demigod, and your physiology is out of control. The general idea is one must be tall, strong, highly muscular, low body fat percentage, I’m not exactly sure what my body fat percentage is, but maybe it’s around 5%. ￼￼Also, physical fitness is critical to any stoic. My ideal is to walk 50 miles a day, eat 20 pounds of meat like Milo of Croton a day. And also, abstinence from silly things like media, alcohol, drugs, marijuana etc. Trust no thinker who does drugs! Even our best friend Nietzsche said that coffee was bad, because it would make people dark and gloomy. He encouraged 100% cocoa powder instead. ￼￼￼ Simple technique: First, look at a picture or a portrait or a full body shot, ideally topless of the artist, philosopher or thinker or individual… then judge their thoughts later. Why? My theory is this: the thoughts of an individual is hugely affected by their bodily physiology. For example, an extreme example: if somebody is locked inside a solitary confinement cell, and not permitted to go outside for years, but, he had a pen and pad and would jot down some thoughts… Would be the quality of these thoughts? Certainly dark and morose. In today’s world, why does it matter, what is the significance of stoicism, etc.? First and foremost, I think we are living in a troubling time, especially with the advent of modern day internet based media and advertising. I think 99% of what is propagated on the internet is fear mongering, and what is hate? Hate is just fear. The first thought on stoicism is that it is just fear conquering. What I discovered about street photography, is that 99% of it is conquering your fears. Conquering your fears of upsetting other people, getting in some sort of verbal or physical altercation etc. In fact my bread and butter workshop is my conquering your fears and street photography workshop, the workshop which is still interesting to me even after a decade. Why is this so important? I think it is rooted in almost everything; conquering your fears is rooted in entrepreneurship, innovation, risktaking and real life. Even my speculation in crypto. 99.9% of crypto speculation is just balls. Having the balls to make big bets, and when things go south, knowing how to master your emotions. A simple extra I have is this: just imagine it will all go down to zero. It was useful because when I was in college, my sophomore year I got really into trading stocks, and I eventually lost my whole life savings, maybe around $3500 USD, and some bad penny stock which I actually misread the financials… the whole time I thought the company was making a profit, but actually it was taking a loss. I actually didn’t know that if profits are written in parentheses, it means a loss. It was funny because my initial start as an investor was back in high school, I bought some Adobe stock when I was a high school junior, and also some mutual funds, which both went up after about 4-5 years. ￼Also I remember in elementary school computer class, when I was in the sixth grade in Bayside Queens, there was some sort of stock stimulation trading game, and actually it was funny… the kids who made the most money and were the most successful just put 100% of everything into Apple, note this is when we were only 12 years old, and I was born in 1988. ￼Funny enough, it seems that stoicism actually plays well with capitalism. Why? According to modern day capitalist thinking, the best way to approach life is to be objective, strong, stoic, unemotional, logical and rational. Also, ￼with modern day media there is so much fear mongering in the news, about some sort of global armageddon, global financial ruin, etc. I call it “fear porn”. Therefore stoicism as a mindset is useful to think and position your mind in such a way that you could consider that life is all upside, no downside. In fact, if I could summarize stoicism in one sentence, it is that life is all upside, no downside. Inspired by NASSIM TALEB. So, is stoicism useful to you if you’re a man or a woman? Does it matter? The good thing is I think it could apply to both sexes. Conquering sexism and social pressures is useful if you’re woman, and also if you’re a man. Also, gender is social. Lot of the expectations set on us by society is socialized and gamed to a certain degree. First, we got to unchain ourselves from modern day ethics and morality. I believe that all modern day philosophy and thinking and ethics and religion is bad. For example, the notion of turning the other cheek is a patently bad one. Why did Jesus turn his cheek? It is because he lacked on army. Also, philosophically I think we should put no trust in Socrates. ￼￼￼I thought which has puzzled me for a long time was this “Why was Socrates so ugly? Monster in face, monster in soul. I think Socrates was a degenerate, and he lacked any sort of real power. Therefore he turned logic and rationality into his terrorizing weapon (via Nietzsche). Back in the day, you didn’t need logic or rationality to have things your way, you simply was able to dictate that which you wanted to pause it, because you had a military force behind you. Just think about Machiavelli and IL PRINCIPE– the reality of being a mercurial prince, king, and military leader is hard, stoic, “immoral”. But ultimately it all comes down to war, conquest, the military. Trust nobody who uses rationality or logic as their tyrannizing weapon. ￼ In fact, I believe that all should have the body and strength of some sort of super soldier. Essentially look like all the guys from the movie 300, this is our ideal. Demigod physique. ￼ And this is the true courage of Kanye West; he literally put everything on the line, and even lost his spouse and I think maybe his kids? All for the sake of revealing inequities. ￼ “I throw these Maybach keys fucking c’est la ￼vie! I know that we the new slaves.”￼- Ye The fun thing about stoicism is that you could just make it up as you go, devise your own strategies and whatever. “Fucking c’est la vie!” My favorite Kanye West line. Essentially the general idea is that in life, one should not take things too seriously. Laughter is golden, I forget the philosopher who was called the laughing philosopher… Democritus?; better to laugh about the follies of human beings rather than to be dark and morose about it. Also, thoughts from the Odyssey; if you look far enough ￼ into the future, everything becomes comedic and hilarious. So when you’re in some sort of bad situation, just think to yourself “Perhaps one day, 20 or 30 years from now… I will look back at this and just laugh!” It will just be humorous. Honestly, laughter, and kind of being able to joke about things might be the best way to live life and deal with setbacks. ￼ Problems in modern day life: A funny thing I have learned is that when you call something something, it isn’t that. For example, if someone calls something a “luxury car”, it ain’t. For example, a true modern day luxury car is maybe a Tesla, but Tesla never calls itself a luxury car. Also the ultimate luxury technology company is probably Apple… but Apple is very intelligent and not calling themselves a luxury brand. A pro tip is when it comes to websites, read the alternative text, the header text, the stuff that shows up in the tab of your browser window. If the website, the automotive retailer tries to market themselves as a “luxury” brand, typically it is actually a sign that it isn’t a luxury brand it isn’t luxury brand. Thought: what are some good examples of true luxury brands which don’t overly calls itself luxury? ￼￼ In someways, we can think and consider stoicism as our new luxury. In fact, having luxury, luxury of mind and soul… and luxury of freedom of speech, isn’t this the ultimate luxury? When somebody asked Diogenes the cynic; “What is the best human good”? He said “Freedom of speech, speaking your mind, having the power to see whatever is on your mind.” In fact, my current joy is becoming more and more free talking, and free riding. What that means is this; I’m ain’t going to censor myself no more, even if I might be politically incorrect insensitive or whatever. ￼ Also, I would prefer to speak my mind and seriously hurt the feelings of others, rather than soften it for the sake of the other person. ￼￼￼Similarly speaking, when people call themselves “influencers”, they are not influencers. Ultimately I think we should think of stoicism just like having another tool inside our tool kit. For example, if you’re a chef, you’re going to have different knives for different purposes. If you’re going to cut a big piece of meat, you probably want a big ass meat cutting knife, not something you would use to slice an apple with. Similarly speaking, if you’re going to scoop out the insides of an avocado, better to use a spoon rather than using a fork, or a knife. ￼ I think the problem is when some people get too into stoicism (I prefer writing stoicism with a lowercase￼), they think that everything needs to be consistent, and must fit into this nice little neat box of what is considered “stoicism“. This is a bad line of thinking… let us consider that Marcus Aurelius never even mentioned stoicism in his writings, his collections of thoughts, which we moderns call THE MEDITATIONS… it was just essentially his personal diary, to help him conquer his own personal fears and thoughts, I don’t think he ever intended it to be published publicly. I think he just wrote it to himself as self therapy. And I think the only stoic philosopher he even mentions is maybe Epictetus. For myself, I just come out with certain to work out thoughts and techniques because it helps me, and when I find these tricks or techniques or secret hacks or cheat codes… My passion is to simply share it with others. ￼￼￼￼ And ultimately, things are ever in flux and evolving and changing and adapting. For example, I’ve discovered the quality of my thinking is different when I am in Culver City Los Angeles, compared to being in the boring suburbs of Orange County. Also depending on my social environments… my stoic thoughts are different when I am in a gym, vs just working out by myself in my parking spot in the back of my apartment. Also, the quality of my thoughts is different when living with family members or other people versus just living with myself Cindy and Seneca. Assuming you’re not growing your own vegetables and living in the middle of nowhere… you probably have some interaction with other human beings. As long as you have an iPhone, an Android phone, a smartphone, a 4G or 5G internet connection, wifi, a laptop, have to buy groceries somewhere… you’re still going to have to interact with other human beings. And this is good. There is no other greater joy than other human beings. In fact, modern-day society is strange because in someways, the ethos is to be antisocial and to be cowardly. But in fact, the best way to think about things is that real life is interaction with other human beings, and social conquest. One can imagine a lot of modern day entrepreneurship as simply a big dick swinging contest. He who is the most masculine confident tall and strong and stoic shall win. Assume that everyone is mentally insane: Have you ever been out in public, and you see some sort of crackhead or strange homeless person who acts radically, smells terrible, and is obviously mentally ill? Do you hate them for it? When they say something weird to you… do you take it personally? No. Why? They are crazy. Perhaps we should just adopt this stoic mindset towards other people; some people are actually physiologically ill, mentally unwell… don’t trust the opinion of nobody. A lot of people are trying to actually deal with their own inner demons: For example, becoming the successful photographer and street photographer I am today… I’ve dealt with some individuals who would say anonymous bad things about me, and later I found out that their mom just died or something. I cannot imagine what it feels like losing a mother… therefore if somebody spew some hate on me because something bad happened to them, I’m not gonna take it personally. ￼￼￼￼￼Self-flagellation: I think a lot of people who are sick, mentally or physiologically self flagellate themselves. Essentially the way that they deal with other people or themselves is some sort of metaphorical self-flagellation. For example… you know those strange individuals who have the whip and whip themselves, and inflict pain on themselves? I think some people do this metaphorically to themselves and others. You just want to stay away from them. My personal theory on fear is that a lot of it is tied to morality and ethics. I think the general idea is not necessarily that we are afraid of anything… I think the true fear is that we’re afraid that we are some sort of bad evil unethical immoral person. For example in street photography, the general ethical thought is that it is immoral to take a photo of somebody without their permission, because there is some sort of it inherent evil behind it. Is this true? No. Taking photos and not really a big deal. I think it is because some people are just overly sensitive, which once again comes from some sort of physiological weakness. For example, if you’re a weightlifter who could lift 1000 pounds, assuming you’re not taking any steroids or anything… are small things going to bother you? No. But let us assume that you are a skinny fat man, all you do is drink alcohol and smoke marijuana and watch Netflix, and you spent too much time on Reddit… you are 40% body fat, and have never lifted in your life. And also your testosterone is low and you never go outside. Certainly the quality of your thoughts is going to be different than if you’re a happy gay monster, lifting weights outside in the direct sun, laughing and having fun. ￼￼￼ In fact, I’ve actually personally discovered that the reason why a lot of people hate me is because I am so happy jovial and gay. They are secretly suspicious or envious of me? ￼ Probably one of my worst experiences was this jarring transition; I was super happy insanely happy being in Vietnam in 2017; with a beautiful weather, the beautiful light, the happy people the great amenities etc.… and then that winter Cindy and I went to Europe, in Marseille Berlin and Prague, and maybe London… seriously the worst winter of my life. Why? I wonder if so much miserable feelings and thoughts simply comes from the darkness and lack of light. a lot of Europe is actually quite miserable; dark, unhygienic, morose. Even Nietzsche had a thought about Schopenhauer; How much of these emo European philosophers came from the fact that it was just complaining about the cold weather in Germany etc.?￼￼For myself, my ideal weather is Southeast Asia; I love being in Phnom Penh Cambodia, Vietnam etc. In the states, am I the only one who loves living in Los Angeles? Dr. Dre and Kendrick Lamar said that LA was the best for women weed and weather… I would definitely say the biggest upside of living in Los Angeles is the light, the sunlight. It actually does get quite cold here, but usually most reliably even in December during the winter time, the sun will always come up. As long as there is bright sunny light, I will be happy. And I think maybe for myself, considering that I am a photographer, and photography means painting with light… light for me is critical. I also wonder how much of it is a physiological thing and a genetic trait; for example I could even recall being a young child, and my mom telling me that the most critical thing in finding a home or an apartment was light and natural light. Even now… 90% of my happiness comes from being able to ￼have access to natural light, ideally floor to ceiling windows facing directly the sun, having some sort of modern temperature regulated apartment and home. Even living in our tiny studio minimalistic luxury apartment in Providence Rhode Island, where it was always 75° warm and cozy, and not frigid and damp and cold and dark and humid… I was always good. But moving to an older house, where it always felt damp and cold… this literally lowered my happiness by 1000%. Therefore, if you’re feeling miserable sad or whatever… I say spend three months living in Hanoi or Saigon in Vietnam, or go to Phnom Penh Cambodia. I wonder if 90% of peoples misery is simply due to the weather. ￼￼”Better to be a gay monster than a sentimental bore!” – Fernandino Galliani, via Nietzsche My stoic ideal is somebody who is happy, gay, smiling, no headphones or AirPods on, no sunglasses on, no hat, no facial hair, no baggy oversized clothing, no tint in their car. Somebody who makes great eye contact, laughs, stands up upright, jokes, and fools around. Like an overgrown child. ￼Also, lift weights at least once every day, ideally in the direct sun. Just buy some weightlifting equipment on Titan.fitness, I like the farmers carry handles, the Olympic loadable dumbbell, and also the Texas power squat bar. Just buy some cheap weights, and or buy a heavy 400 pound sandbag, and just have fun throwing it around. A true stoic should look something like Hercules or Achilles. Or like ERIC KIM; I have the aesthetic and the physique of Brad Pitt in FIGHT CLUB except with a lot more muscle. Like my friend Soren says, the Adonis physique and proportions. I think a real stoic is sexy, happy and fun. Who doesn’t take life too seriously; and think of everything like a fun game. A real stoic would be joyful and cheery like three-year-old child without any adulteration from the outside world. I don’t like talking with or hanging out with adults, uninteresting. At what point or age do people become so emo? Typically, highschoolers are very optimistic. Even college students. But I think at least in maybe college in high school nowadays… the bad trend is towards “over concern”, about the world the planet ethics animals etc. I find a lot of this thinking superficial, performative, and uncritical. I think “animal rights“, “saving the planet” is this new pseudo world religion; which is just capitalism 3.0. I find the whole pet industry the whole dog industry to be insanely bizarre, and I trust nobody who talks about “saving the planet“ who owns an iPhone, owns any sort of car, or has an Amazon prime subscription. Certainly not any vegans. Animals are animals. They are lower on the hierarchy and totem pole on earth. Man is the apex predator, the apex bully and the apex tyrant. Should we care for animals or “animal rights”? No. Animals are our slaves. If you consider even dogs and pets… they are essentially our emotional slaves. People talk a lot about the virtuosity of dogs being loyal or whatever… and giving you unconditional love. This seems like some sort of emotional slavery. The only dogs I respect are some sort of canine dogs, some sort of attack or defense dogs, or hunting dogs. For example, John Wick 3; Halle Barry and her dogs. An animal should either be a weapon, or nothing. Essentially it looks like men no longer have a backbone. No more spine. I trust nobody who owns a dog. Let us not forget; they call it dog ownership, or “owning a pet”. There is no more concept of “human ownership, or “owning a human.”￼￼￼ What is the end goal of humanity? To me it is towards entrepreneurship, innovation, art and aesthetics, philosophy etc. Design. Stoicism should be considered a tool which could aid you in these things. For example, I think 99% of entrepreneurship is courage. Stoicism could help you with that. I also think with design, great design is also 99% courage, having the courage to attempt something that won’t sell or be received well… stoicism is all about practical courage. The only designers with courage include Steve Jobs, Jony Ive, Elon Musk, Kanye West. ￼ Also, weightlifting. To attempt to lift a certain weight you have never attempted before takes great courage. For example, me atlas lifting 1000 pounds; that is 10 plates and a 25 on each side, ￼￼￼this is true stoic training. Why? The fear of injury is what holds most people back; if you had successfully conquered this fear and not injured yourself, this is pure stoic bliss. I think the only and the only proper way to lift weights is one repetition maximum training. That is; what is the maximum amount of weight you’re able to successfully lift or move, even half an inch? To me, the courage is the success. Even if you had the courage to attempt it… that is what is considered success. ￼￼ Simple exercises to do include the atlas lift, innovated by ERIC KIM, or a one repetition max rack pull. Or, a high trap bar deadlift, heavy Farmer’s walks, or heavy sandbag carries. Or even a simple thing you could do is go to the park or to the local nature center, find the biggest rock there and just see if you could pick it up. If you’re interested in stoicism, and have had some interesting thoughts on stoicism, one of the most noble things you could do is start your own blog. I think blogs are 1000 times more effective than publishing some sort of static printed book; I think the problem in today’s world is that everyone is seeking some sort of legitimacy by being picked up by some sort of legitimate publisher and getting “published“, and seeing your printed book at Barnes & Noble whatever. I say it is better to be open source, free and permissionless, ￼￼￼decentralized. Just publish your thoughts and book as a free PDF, and just host it on dropbox, Google Drive, or your own web server. Share the link freely, and also just publish the raw text as a big blog post. ￼ Even Sam Bankman-Fried wisely thought; 99.9% of books could just be summarized as big blog posts. Don’t trust any modern day published book which isn’t free, because… there is some sort of hidden clout chasing somewhere. ￼ Even one of the worst compromises that led to the demise of Ray Dalio was the fact that he took his Principles book, which was essentially a free ebook PDF on his website, and then took it off, because I think he got a book deal with Simon and Schuster. After he did that, he lost my respect. If you’re already independently wealthy, and you don’t crowd source your self-esteem… why would you need to externally validate yourself by getting some sort of constipated publisher and annoying editor? Editors are bad. Start your own blog and start blogging your own thoughts on stoic philosophy, and even start a YouTube channel and start vlogging on it. ￼￼My generalized thought is simple: if your thought your idea your blog post your video or whatever could even impact the life of one other human being on planet earth… it is worth it.
