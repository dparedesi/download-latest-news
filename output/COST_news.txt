July 2, 2025 / 12:49 PM EDT / CBS News Gold investing has surged in popularity so much in recent years that investors could be forgiven for forgetting that this is traditionally considered an alternative, safe-haven asset. While items like stocks, real estate and bonds can often be relied upon for generating income, gold is typically considered a smart way to diversify your portfolio and hedge against inflation. Without the quick profit-earning potential that those other assets often provide, however, it's understandable that many have yet to turn to gold. But that could be a mistake, particularly now. With the need for a portfolio diversifier high, and both the protection against today's inflation and the next inevitable round pertinent, many would benefit from considering gold now. And physical gold, in the form of gold bars and coins, can be especially valuable for investors this July. Before diving into the gold market, however, it helps to better understand why gold, in this particular form, makes so much sense this month. Below, we'll detail three supporting reasons why it could be worth investing in now. Start protecting your portfolio with a reliable gold investment today. Here are three strong (and timely) reasons why a gold bar and coin investment makes sense this July: Stock market uncertainty earlier this year, combined with unpredictability surrounding the future of the economy, may understandably leave you uncomfortable investing in assets and items that you have little control over. But that's not a concern with gold bars and coins, as they offer you a tangible asset in an unpredictable economy. You can inspect your gold investment with precision, store it in the safety of your own home and otherwise enjoy the benefits that only a tangible asset like gold can offer. The only thing you'll need to monitor? The price of gold. And, fortunately for your investment, that looks to be only heading upward over time. Explore your gold bars and coins options here and get invested now. The days of jotting down a gold investing company phone number from an infomercial are long gone. Gold investing is ubiquitous now and, as such, gold bars and coins specifically are easy to buy, sell and buy more of. Whether you're using a top gold investing company or simply driving over to a big retailer like Costco or Walmart, you should have little issue buying a coin or bar right now. And you can do so online, as well, either on these retailer websites or by perusing the top gold companies doing business right now. The price of gold per ounce is $3,359.04 as of July 2. That's just under the record $3,400 gold hovered near earlier this year. And with predictions of gold hitting the $4,000 mark later in 2025, new investors may be wondering how they can break into the gold market for a reasonable price. Fortunately, physical gold offers this opportunity. By investing in fractional gold bars and coins, which weigh less than the traditional troy ounce, investors can secure the protection gold offers without having to overpay or shift resources from other assets at the same time. This allows investors to earn all of the same benefits that a gold investment in a larger size can provide while still keeping costs low and gold limited to a maximum 10% portfolio threshold. July 2025 could be the time to enter the physical gold market for investors who haven't yet got started. With the ability to offer investors a tangible asset in an uncertain economy, a simplicity in terms of buying and selling and an entry price point that can be tailored to your budget thanks to fractional gold amounts, gold bars and coins have multiple advantages this month. By taking advantage now, you may even be able to sell your gold for a quick profit later this fall, too, making it one of the overall better investment choices this summer.

Title: Forbes Daily: Tesla’s ‘Soap Opera’ Continues Ahead Of EV Sales Report

ByDanielle Chemtob andForbes Daily ByDanielle Chemtob, Forbes Staff andForbes Daily, Forbes Staff. Thanks to TikTok and other social media apps, finding “dupes” of high-end products is easier than ever. Now, Lululemon is taking Costco to court over the issue. The popular athletic wear brand sued the retailer for selling products that allegedly rip off some of its most popular items at a cheaper price point. Dozens of brands have sued over dupes, but it’s not just about proving a product was copied: The creators must show that a copycat product could confuse customers into thinking they’re buying the real thing. Still, many shoppers are intentionally seeking out fake products, one trademark lawyer told Forbes, which makes it much harder to prove brand confusion. Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) speaks to reporters off the Senate floor after the Senate passes President Donald Trump's so-called "One, Big, Beautiful Bill," Act at the U.S. Capitol Building. After a marathon negotiation session to convince GOP holdouts, the Senate advanced President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill, with Vice President JD Vance casting the tie-breaking vote. There are several key additions and omissions from earlier versions, including a softening on credits for wind and solar projects as well as more rural hospital funds. House leadership said it will vote on the Senate version Wednesday. In passing the bill, the Senate approved more than $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid over the next 10 years and changes to federally funded health insurance programs that would leave nearly 12 million people without coverage, according to an estimate from the Congressional Budget Office. Republicans defending the cuts say they are aimed at reducing abuse, waste and fraud, as most of the Medicaid cuts come via new work requirements for some recipients. President Donald Trump and Elon Musk outside the White House in March. After President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk sparred again over his signature spending bill, Musk’s net worth plunged by $9.5 billion on the company’s more than 5% stock decline. Tesla shares are down 13% since the end of May, just before Musk and Trump’s public feud began. Musk remains the world’s richest man, but saw the biggest daily loss of any billionaire tracked by Forbes Tuesday. MORE: Tesla is expected to report a major drop in electric vehicle sales today, and Musk’s meltdown over the legislation raises the possibility that the intemperate billionaire is once again courting new risks for his companies, which have received at least $30 billion in federal support since 2010. Typically bullish on Tesla, analyst Dan Ives called it a “soap opera that remains an overhang on Tesla’s stock.” EQT, Europe’s largest buyout fund, is shaking up its venture arm amid plans to increase investments in American startups. The $315 billion asset manager promoted investor Carolina Brochado to head up venture and growth investments from a new outpost in New York and announced the departure of four partners. Just months after slashing funding for U.S.-funded international broadcaster Voice of America, President Donald Trump’s media company is testing a global rollout of its streaming platform, raising conflict-of-interest concerns. Truth Social parent company Trump Media & Technology Group said the beta test of its streaming platform, Truth+, aims to expand beyond North America. Paramount's settlement will be paid directly to Trump's future presidential library. Paramount says it has agreed to pay President Donald Trump $16 million to settle a lawsuit filed over a 60 Minutes interview aired last year of former Vice President Kamala Harris, which Trump alleged was edited to make the Democratic candidate appear more competent. As part of the settlement, Paramount said that 60 Minutes will release transcripts of all interviews with presidential candidates moving forward. Charlie Riedel/AP File President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act—assuming the version Senate Republicans passed on Tuesday becomes law—would cut the legs out from under the renewable energy industry. The biggest hit: The bill would phase out federal tax credits that have for years enabled wind and solar developers to offset 30% or more of project costs. Ironically, these impacts will hit especially hard in Republican areas: 78% of renewable energy projects underway are located in Red districts. Co-CEOs Collin Roche (left) and Dean Mihas (right) are leading the second generation in charge of 45-year-old private equity firm GTCR. While private equity managers hoping for a dealmaking bonanza under President Donald Trump’s administration have been sorely disappointed, GTCR has bucked the trend with a series of gaudy exits. The Chicago-based firm’s $45 billion in assets under management pale in comparison to Wall Street’s biggest players like Blackstone, Apollo and KKR, but none of its peers made off with a deal like GTCR’s and FIS’ sale of Worldpay to Global Payments for $24.25 billion, announced in April and expected to close in the first half of 2026. GTCR bought a 55% stake in the Cincinnati-based payment processing firm from FIS at an $18.5 billion valuation in July 2023, and flipped it in less than two years for double the equity it invested. This comes during a time when the average holding period for the private equity industry crept up to more than six years in 2023 and 2024, a signal that many firms are struggling to find buyers for their businesses. And since the Worldpay deal, GTCR announced two more smaller sales in May, offloading lab equipment firm Antylia Scientific and insurance software business Itel for more than $1 billion each. The flurry of activity means GTCR is expected to return a reported $5 billion in proceeds to investors this year, building on a strong track record for its recent flagship funds. WHY IT MATTERS “It was a slow first half of the year for private equity, but there are always going to be winners and losers on Wall Street, and GTCR is one under-the-radar firm that seized the spotlight,” says Forbes staff writer Hank Tucker. “Its success could make pension funds and endowments hopeful that a rebound is coming for the buyout firms in their portfolios, even while rumors are circulating that some institutions are trying to sell stakes of their private equity investments at discounted prices.” MORE These 7 European And Asian Stocks Are Crushing It And Still Cheap As political divisions in the U.S. continue to grow, a majority of Americans believe politically motivated violence is now a major problem, a new poll shows: 76%: The share of Americans who believe the issues dividing the nation pose a serious threat to democracy, according to the NPR/PBS News/Marist poll 25: The number of attacks and plots targeting elected officials, candidates and other government employees from 2016 to 2025, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies Three times: The number of politically motivated attacks and plots against government agents in just the past five years is three times higher than those in the previous 25 years combined Underperforming the market can cost thousands of dollars of gains in just a few years—so be sure to avoid some of these common mistakes. Don’t try to time the market, and invest consistently each month. Don’t put all of your investments into one stock or sector, and if you do pick individual stocks, take the time to research them. Lastly, build an emergency fund before you start investing so you don’t have to dip into your investments during market downturns.

Food prices have soared at NZ supermarkets. Photo / RNZ By Louise Ternouth of RNZ Whether it is a block of butter or cheese, a kilogram of mince, a dozen eggs or a cooked chook, food prices have gone up rapidly. The latest Stats NZ figures show that in the past 12 months, food prices have gone up 4.4% – the highest increase since December 2023. Over the past three years, RNZ’s Checkpoint has been tracking a weekly shop from the same suburb at a Woolworths and Pak’nSave supermarket to see just how much things have gone up at the checkout. Some of the results are more eye-watering than mouth-watering. For over three years, Checkpoint has tracked the cost of 36 items likely to be in a household’s trolley. In May 2022, a shopping trip to Woolworths Greenlane cost $238 and $217 at Pak’nSave Royal Oak. Today, those same items at Woolworths have shot up to $305 – an extra $67 at the checkout. At Pak’nSave the items now cost $270, an extra $53. Compared to 2022, seasonal vegetables like carrots and cabbage were cheaper. Other items that had come down slightly or stayed the same were Watties baked beans, plain flour, Mightyfresh wheatmeal toast bread and diced tomatoes. But they were mostly exceptions, most of the items on the shopping list cost more. Some shoppers told Checkpoint they have noticed an increase on some items in particular. “Olive oil is really expensive and eggs,” said one shopper. “Dairy items I’ve noticed but even just general fresh fruit and vege.” Others said meat was on the list. Unsurprisingly, dairy had one of the biggest jumps. At both supermarkets you still could not get a 1kg block of cheese for $10 or less. Though 1kg is now $1 cheaper at Woolworths for $12.49. At Pak’nSave a 1kg block stayed much the same at $11.89. Two litres of standard blue top milk were sitting at just under $5 at both supermarkets. In 2022, a 500g block of Woolworths branded butter cost $5.80, now a whopping $8.50. At Pak’nSave it was a similar story, in 2022 it was $5.70 for a Pams 500g block, now $8.30. One shopper said their family uses a lot of butter and they were feeling the pinch, “It’s been absolutely ridiculous it’s almost $10.” Others said they bought butter in bulk from Costco to save money “to buy cheaper New Zealand butter in bulk and freeze it rather than buying at the supermarkets”. A 50 box of Twinning’s Earl Grey tea more than doubled in price at Pak’nSave to $7.89. As for a dozen barn eggs, those more than doubled at Pak’nSave to $9.59 and $9.50 at Woolworths. The humble beef mince now not so humble at 1kg used to cost $11.99 at Pak’nSave, now $18.99. At Countdown, it was up from $14.90 in 2022 to $23.80 now. For some, it is now a luxury among other items they are going without. “Probably meat products and dairy,” said one shopper. Others were also leaving those products on the shelves and opting for a butter “blend” and no brand versions. One man said snacks were off the shopping list. “Snack bars and extra things you’d put into kids lunches.” One woman said she had left her broccoli and cauliflower out of the shop. Washing and toiletry products also came out far more expensive. Four kilograms of Persil sensitive washing powder was $22 at both supermarkets in 2022, now an extra $13 at Woolworths and $6.50 more at Pak’nSave. Huggies size 3 nappies were an extra $10 at Pak’nSave and a litre of Palmolive body wash was an extra $5 at Woolworths. For those advising to stock up on staples or frozen to cut costs, rice, noodles, sugar and frozen vegetables – all more expensive. – RNZ Investigation revealed how Vietnamese crime groups exploited hundreds of migrant workers.
