The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change Quote of the Week: “Whoever undertakes to set himself up as a judge in the field of Truth and Knowledge is shipwrecked by the laughter of the gods.” – Albert Einstein (1953) Number of the Week: 2,000 years ago THIS WEEK: By Ken Haapala, President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP) Scope: This Week begins with a discussion by Roy Spencer on adjustments that may be needed on the record high temperature recorded in Death Valley California. Kenneth Richard suggests five papers that indicate that increasing CO2 may have an insignificant influence on global temperatures. Roger Caiazza discusses problems New York State may have in meeting its energy goals, particularly replacing fossil fuels and nuclear with alternatives. Matt Ridley points out that the recent flooding of Valencia may be the result of eliminating flood control dams. Comments on the beginning of COP-29 are presented. An article by an academic illustrates what is too frequently missed in academic analyses of energy policy. ********************* A Fallen Icon? Roy Spencer continued his essays exploring the widely accepted high temperature for the United States of 134° F (57° C) recorded at Greenland Ranch in Death Valley California (now called Furnace Creek Ranch) on July 10, 1913. John Christy prompted Spencer to look into this record. Recently, after extensive historical research, William Reidd doubted the record and suggested the new observer in 1913 was disillusioned by the low readings taken at the official weather station. He may have substituted readings from his front porch of official readings. Reid provided a photograph showing that the official station was located by an irrigated alfalfa field, which was not a typical the desert location. In the summer, irrigation in the desert lowers daytime high temperatures and raises nighttime low temperatures. So, the siting of the weather station was poor, and it probably produced high temperature readings that were too low for the area, but that is not known. Spencer states: “In my experience, unless the vegetation area is rather large, and there is almost no wind, a weather station’s daily maximum temperature will still be largely determined by air flowing from the larger-scale desert surroundings. But note… this is different from, say a poorly sited thermometer next to a brick wall or heat pump where hot air from an isolated source can elevate the daily maximum temperature recorded).” Spencer analyzes maximum temperatures for the 27 surrounding stations up to 100 miles away from Death Valley and at different elevations for the period 1935 to 1938. Then he examines the maximum temperatures for the 3 to 7 stations during 1912 to 1915 and finds significant disparity from the Death Valley records. Spencer then provides a statistical analysis based on lapse rate to adjust for the different elevations in this dry climate. He concludes: “The 134 deg. F world record hottest temperature from Death Valley is likely around 10 deg. F too high, compared to elevation-adjusted temperatures from surrounding stations. The most likely cause is that the ranch foreman’s reported measurements were (shall we say) unacademically recorded. I find it rather remarkable that the world record hottest temperature from Death Valley was not revised many years ago, since the methods for “fact checking” the record are fairly simple and based upon meteorological principles known for well over 50 years.” So, we do not know what the highest temperature recorded in the US is. It may be around 10° F, 6° C too high. Until NOAA began manipulating the US surface temperature records in the early part of the 21st century with no clear justification and no record of changes, the US record was the best in the world covering a large area. One wonders how many of the surface records used by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and its collaborators can stand up to the rigorous examination Roy Spencer did on the Greenland Ranch record. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy. *************** Miniscule Effect of CO2: Kenneth Richard discusses six papers: one that asserts that CO2 is the control knob of Earth’s temperatures and five that refute that assertion. In addressing the claim that CO2’s climate effects are undetectable Richard states: “Of course, this very unfalsifiable thought experiment is what believers in the CO2-is-the-climate-control-knob narrative rest their case on. But even if we do use this imaginary-world premise, the existing models (MODTRAN, HITRAN) that allegedly support the CO2-controls-climate orthodoxy actually undermine it.” Richard then discusses five papers that contradict the CO2 controls-climate notion. He does not discuss the contradictions TWTW prefers. The papers from van Wijngaarden and Happer use the high resolution HITRAN spectroscopy as discussed in last week’s TWTW, under Updating HITRAN. In their papers van Wijngaarden and Happer have convincingly demonstrated that adding CO2 to the atmosphere has a miniscule effect on temperatures. For example, see Figure 7 in their “The Role of Greenhouse Gases in Energy Transfer in the Earth’s Atmosphere.” These estimates are well tested using satellite data over Guam (tropics), the Sahara (desert); Mediterranean (mid-latitudes) and the Antarctic (polar regions). Based on these calculations, the overall impact of CO2 at current concentrations is less than 25% of the greenhouse effect, and doubling CO2 concentration would add a mere 2%. Water vapor accounts for almost all of the effect. The one issue that is still not clear is clouds. The calculations by van Wijngaarden and Happer are for clear skies. Clouds are extremely complicated, and no one has developed an adequate theory for their formation and dissipation. However, their overall influence will reduce the warming of Earth from the greenhouse effect. This was seen during the Little Ice Age in Europe, when skies were overcast, growing seasons were short, and crops frequently did not ripen properly in the northern parts of Europe. Diseases attributed to mycotoxins formed by moldy grain were common. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy – Radiation Transfer. *************** Dreams Hit Reality: New York State has adopted an imaginative energy policy the “Dispatchable Emissions-Free Resource” – DEFR. Dispatchable means that the power source can be adjusted to match the electricity demand. Nuclear, coal, and similar power plants require time to adjust. Gas and Combined Cycle Gas Generation can be adjusted in less time. Gas turbines require little time. Wind and solar cannot be adjusted to increase output unless they are operating under capacity for current weather conditions. Large hydropower can be adjusted quickly. New York State, which has no additional hydropower practically possible, has closed all but three nuclear power plants. No one has identified a Dispatchable Emissions-Free Resource to fill increasing state needs. Given these conditions, Roger Caiazza who analyzes electricity needs for New York State discusses “Renewable Transition Raw Materials Challenge” based on the Bulletin 416 of the Bulletins of the Geological Survey of Finland, which “publishes the results of scientific research that is thematically or geographically connected to Finnish or Fennoscandian geology.” The Abstract of a paper referenced in the bulletin is “Scope of the replacement system to globally phase out fossil fuels” which states: “The task to phase out fossil fuels is now at hand. Most studies and publications to date focus on why fossil fuels should be phased out. This study presents the physical requirements in terms of required non-fossil fuel industrial capacity, to completely phase out fossil fuels, and maintain the existing industrial ecosystem. The existing industrial ecosystem dependency on fossil fuels was mapped by fuel (oil, gas, and coal) and by industrial application. Data were collected globally for fossil fuel consumption, physical activity, and industrial actions for the year 2018. The estimated sum total of extra annual capacity of non-fossil fuel power generation to phase out fossil fuels completely, and maintain the existing industrial ecosystem, at a global scale is 48,939.8 TWh. A discussion on the needed size of the stationary power storage buffer to manage intermittent energy supply from wind and solar was conducted. Pumped hydro, hydrogen, biofuels, and ammonia were all examined as options in this paper. This study uses four stationary power buffer capacities: 6 hours, 48 hours + 10%, 28 days and 12 weeks. This power buffer is assumed to be supplied through the use of large battery banks (in line with strategic policy expectations). An estimate is presented for the total quantity of metals required to manufacture a single generation of renewable technology units (EV’s, solar panels, wind turbines, etc.) sufficient to replace energy technologies based on combustion of fossil fuels. This estimate was derived by assembling the number of units needed against the estimated metal content for individual battery chemistries, wind turbines, solar panels, and electric vehicles. The majority of the metals needed were to resource the construction of stationary power storage to act as a buffer for wind and solar power generation. It was shown that both 2019 global mine production, 2022 global reserve estimates, 2022 mineral resources, and estimates of undersea resources, were manifestly inadequate for meeting projected demand for copper, lithium, nickel, cobalt, graphite, and vanadium.” Another second article referenced in the Bulletin is “Quantity of metals required to manufacture one generation of renewable technology units to phase out fossil fuel.” The abstract of that paper states: “An estimate is presented for the total quantity of raw materials required to manufacture a single generation of renewable technology units (solar panels, wind turbines, etc.) sufficient to replace energy technologies based on combustion of fossil fuels. This estimate was derived by assembling the number of units needed against the estimated metal con- tent for individual battery chemistries, wind turbines, solar panels, and electric vehicles. The majority of the metals needed were to resource the construction of stationary power storage to act as a buffer for wind and solar power generation. This study uses four stationary power buffer capacities as modelled in a previous study: 6 hours, 48 hours + 10%, 28 days and 12 weeks. This power buffer is assumed to be supplied through the use of large battery banks (in line with strategic policy expectations). Metal quantities were calculated for all four capacities and compared with mining production, mineral reserves, mineral resources, and known undersea resources. It was also assessed whether recycling could deliver this metal quantity by comparing calculations against the sum total mined metal between 1990 and 2023. The quantity of metal mined over the last 34 years was inadequate, which means recycling cannot deliver the needed capacity, and the mining of minerals would have to be the primary source of metals for at least the first generation of non-fossil fuel technology. If a metal has not yet been mined, then that metal cannot be recycled.” [Boldface added] Caiazza provides a solid analysis of this bulletin and concludes: “This is an ambitious analysis that covers the entire global energy system. As such there are bound to be oversights and limitations as well as interpretative assumptions that could be issues. In my opinion, however, the approach and assumptions are reasonable and should give a reasonable estimate of the metals needed. The mass of metals available is another challenge but I think there is better historical data available. Comparing the metals needed to the metals available leads to the inescapable conclusion that the dreams of replacing fossil fuels will be unable to overcome reality.” [Boldface added] New York State’s Dispatchable Emissions-Free Resource remains a pipedream without nuclear or hydropower additions. Both omissions will greatly increase the costs of electricity to consumers in the state. Yet, politicians continue to pretend reliable electricity is not needed. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy. *************** Destroying Resilience: The recent flooding of Valencia, Spain, has been declared an example of an extreme weather event intensified by climate change (whatever that is). Writing in The Spectator (UK), Matt Ridely provides a different view. He writes: In the past few years, the Spanish government has been removing dams at a furious rate. Under a European Union program to encourage the restoration of rivers to their wild state for the benefit of fish migration, Spain set about dismantling barriers of all kinds. In 2021 it got rid of 108 dams and weirs; in 2022, another 133. That year, according to Dam Removal Europe, a coalition of seven green pressure groups, it was Europe’s proud league champion at dismantling them. Last year it was second only to France. [Boldface added] Some dams were removed in the hills around Valencia but it turns out they were small irrigation dams, not reservoir dams, so they would not have made much difference last week. However, the failure to build a new dam may well be partly to blame. The Cheste dam in the Turia catchment was specifically designed to prevent flooding, to ‘regulate the flows coming from the upper basin of the Poyo and Pozalet ravines. It was approved in 2001 as part of a National Hydrological Plan. Objections from people in Aragon to separate parts of the plan that would transfer water between regions led the socialist Jose Luis Rodríguez Zapatero to promise to repeal it when running for prime minister in 2004. He kept his promise and the Cheste dam was an unintended casualty. Could it have saved Valencia? Possibly. The [capital] city of Aragon was saved last month by a dam built by the emperor Augustus.” These extreme weather events have been going on since the time of Emperor Augustus and are not the result of recent “climate change.” Instead, the high death toll is the result of destruction of the resilience provided by dams designed to prevent flooding. A similar failure to build dams recommended by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) near Ashville, NC, probably resulted in the recent flooding there. See links under Changing Weather. *************** A Circus? The 29th Conference of Parties (COP 29) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) has begun in Baku, Azerbaijan, an oil and gas producing country According to reports, in his welcoming speech to the delegates and other attendees, the President of the host country declared oil and gas are gifts of God. The President of COP 29, Azerbaijan’s Mister for Ecology, demanded that climate change be treated with the same urgency as COVID-19 for which “advanced economies marshalled $8 trillion over the course of just 48 months.” Not to be outdone, Jo Nova reports that the world’s largest emitter of carbon dioxide, by far, China, wants $1.3 trillion from wealthy nations. This “backward” nation has planned 100 space launches for 2024 in its goal to put someone on the Moon by 2030. Meanwhile White House climate adviser John Podesta who is at the conference assured the attendees that the US will move forward in “combating climate change despite the election of President-elect Trump, who has long cast doubt on the science behind the issue.” In December 2023, the US State Department issued a report on the US Climate Finance Pledge which stated: “The United States is committed to exercising U.S. leadership to implement the goals of the Paris Agreement, to accelerate the global clean energy transition, and to enable vulnerable countries and communities to build resilience against the impacts of climate change. To that end, the United States will continue to support developing country partners as they pursue ambitious climate action. The United States has prioritized boosting international climate finance, as well as demanding that international financial institutions evolve to better enable emerging market and developing countries to respond to global challenges, including climate change. That is why President Biden launched the first U.S. International Climate Finance Plan in 2021 and committed to work with Congress to scale up international public climate finance to over $11 billion annually by 2024, quadrupling from the highest previous levels of climate finance provided by the United States.” Apparently, some attendees believe that believe oil and gas are “gifts of God” ignoring them is very costly. Will wealthy countries will continue with the dubious pledges of a few, now irrelevant, politicians? See links under After Paris and Below the Bottom Line. *************** Ignore the Obvious: The director of the Energy, Climate Justice, and Sustainability Lab and a research professor at New York University’s School of Professional Studies authored an essay in the Wall Street Journal that exemplifies the approach some academics take about “climate change” and the phony “climate crisis.” In “Five Ways to Disaster-Proof the Energy Grid: With extreme weather events—and power outages—on the rise, utilities and tech companies are looking at what they can do to keep the lights on in the future” the author ignores that the claim of rising extreme weather events is refuted by physical evidence. Her five approaches are: 1) Better prediction using AI; 2) Better batteries; 3) Independent microgrids; 4) Better, stronger transmission lines; and 5) Controlling demand. One, will AI allow better predictions? Utilities are well aware of the limitations of their equipment. The problem is better weather prediction. Unfortunately, with NOAA weather prediction is ignored in favor of the fantasy of climate prediction. Then there is the problem of chaos beyond two-week predictions. It may be better to just expect the worse and hope it does not happen. Two, better batteries. Storage of electricity has long been a problem for utilities. In 1907 pumped hydro storage was used on a small scale in Switzerland. In 1930 it was used in the US by the Connecticut Electric and Power Company. The largest US facility is the Dominion Electric Bath County, VA, plant. In the summer, the system needs replenishment each weekend from reliable power plants. On the utility scale, batteries remain a dream, not a reality. Three: independent microgrids. This works for hospitals etc. if they provide on-site storage of fuel needed for generation. But microgrids do not work for the general public. As seen in the last major winter storm that brought down the Texas grid, just in time delivery of natural gas does not work. The fuel must be available on site. Wind power failed and promised wind resistant solar panels are of little use at night. Four: better, stronger transmission lines: They are always a goal, but require maintenance. Environmental advocates object to cutting back vegetation to protect the transmission and distribution lines. Five: Controlling demand: This is always the favorite of authoritarians. They, not the public, will decide who will get electricity and when. It may work in an authoritarian state but not in a republic with certain personal rights enshrined in its Constitution. What the author ignores is that wind and solar are unreliable and add to the fragility of the grid making it more subject to disruption in severe weather events. See Article #2 *************** Number of the Week: 2,000 years ago. According to Matt Ridley, the city of Aragon [actually Zaragoza], Spain, was recently saved by a dam built by the emperor Augustus. Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus, also known as Octavian, reigned as the first Roman emperor from 27 BC until his death in AD 14. Apparently, the Romans knew of the dangers of flooding in eastern Spain over 2,000 years ago. And such flooding is called extreme weather brought on by recent climate change? [That was during the infamous Roman warm period, which was even warmer than the Medieval warm period, which was even warmer than today.] See links under Changing Weather.

Nov 12, 2024 The Global Carbon Budget report, produced by an international team of more than 120 scientists, provides an annual, peer-reviewed update, building on established methodologies in a fully transparent manner. The 2024 edition (the 19th annual report) will be published in the journal Earth System Science Data on November 13 as a pre-print, and later as a peer-reviewed paper. From the article: For example, India’s emissions, which are projected to be about equal to those of the EU this year, will increase by about 5 percent over their 2023 levels. And the amount of methane and carbon dioxide rising from the rest of the world — which accounts for roughly the same share of global emissions as China and the EU combined — is on track to rise by about 1 percent.

CDN Bids Farewell By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Nov 13, 2024 Green Grifters Another elite-laden conference demonstrates the staggering hypocrisy of climate-change activism. By Heather MacDonald, City Journal, Nov 12, 2024 [H/t Tilak Doshi] It is the self-punishing futility of restricting American manufacturing and development while America’s competitors do whatever it takes to seize the economic advantage that drove Trump to pull out of the Paris climate accord the first time around. The [NY] Times worries that China could assume “leadership of international efforts to address climate change” if the U.S. withdraws again. If China does assume such leadership, it will not be at the cost of its own manufacturing base and standard of living.

Science, Policy, and Evidence To President-Elect Trump: Recommendations for NOAA and the National Weather Service By Mike Smith, MSE Creative Consulting, Nov 12, 2024 But, today’s NOAA gives, for example, $10 million grants to unaccountable ‘nonprofits’ for ‘environment education’ and other ‘progressive’ nonsense that, not so coincidently, is always on the side of global warming advocacy. That needs to stop whether NOAA is broken up or not as it is a built-in conflict of interest with scientific ethics. Meanwhile, the NWS is so money-poor it can’t even launch routine weather balloons in all of the locations where needed. Ten million dollars would alleviate that problem.

We conclude that these long-term changes in oceanographic parameters may still be too small to have a measurable impact on shoreline recession/progradation and that primary drivers such as ambient imbalances in the coastal sediment budget may be masking any such linkages.

[SEPP Comment: In wetlands such as mangrove swamps, the coastline is difficult to determine.] Changing Cryosphere – Land / Sea Ice The incredible vanishing polar bears By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Nov 13, 2024 Link to paper using models: Identifying indicators of polar bear population status By Karyn D. Rode, et al., Ecological Indicators, February 2024 Vanishing from the headlines, that is. Probably because in the real world they are doing just fine. From paper: “…Thus, an increase in the duration of open water during the summer and the associated increase in ocean productivity with warming may benefit polar bear prey species.” Agriculture Issues & Fear of Famine Why The War On Nitrous Oxide? By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Nov 14, 2024 [SEPP Comment: Another ineffective greenhouse gas, which modelers pretend is effective because they don’t include water vapor in their calculations.] Lowering Standards DOE Efficiency Standards: Consumer Time? By Mark Krebs and Tom Tanton, Master Resource, Nov 14, 2024 After all, the world has fundamentally changed since DOE was formed to address certain issues: low supplies and scarcity, coupled with cartel behavior by foreign actors. Today we have robust supplies that mainly just need regulatory relief. [SEPP Comment: For consumers, many so-called energy savings make no sense. Individual solar panels may reduce electricity costs for individual consumers but are a disaster on the grid, as in sunny, southern California, consumers lose.] Communicating Better to the Public – Use Yellow (Green) Journalism? Fossil fuel pollution hits record high: Research By Zack Budryk, The Hill, Nov 13, 2024 [SEPP Comment: If CO2 is a pollutant, why do plants and life dependent on them flourish with more CO2?] Trump’s reelection casts a shadow over the start of global climate negotiations By Michael Copley, Jeff Brady, Julia Simon, Lauren Sommer, and Nate Perez, NPR, Nov 11, 2024 But Donald Trump’s return to the presidency in the United States, the biggest historical contributor of greenhouse gas pollution heating the planet, raises questions about whether the country will continue working on global climate initiatives. [SEPP Comment: Typical NPR, peddling fear of carbon dioxide and ignoring that China is by far the biggest emitter of CO2 and emissions in China and South Asia are growing rapidly.] Communicating Better to the Public – Make things up. Plankton are the backbone of the ocean — and may struggle with what’s coming A pair of papers in the journal Nature shows how plankton are struggling to survive in warming seas. By Dino Grandoni, The Washington Post, November 13, 2024 [H/t Jim Buell} Links not given, one probable link: Past foraminiferal acclimatization capacity is limited during future warming By Rui Ying, et al., Nature, Nov 13, 2024 From abstract: However, when forcing the trait-based plankton model with rapid transient warming over the coming century (1.5 °C, 2 °C, 3 °C and 4 °C relative to pre-industrial baseline), the model suggests that the acclimatization capacities of all ecogroups are limited and insufficient to track warming rates. From the article: To assess future impacts of warming waters on plankton, Schmidt and her colleagues turned to ancient changes. The team analyzed an extensive fossil record of a type of plankton called foraminifera, which leave behind tiny shells that fall to the seafloor when they die. Even for those who forgo eating fish, plankton are crucial for preventing climate change from getting even worse than it is. When foraminifera form their shells, they bind carbon with calcium to make their building material. After they die, the shells fall to the seafloor, locking that carbon out of the atmosphere for eons. [SEPP Comment: The assumptions are false. Different species adapt to warming and cooling differently. Plankton created important sediments during Hothouse Earth!] Expanding the Orthodoxy The Global Catastrophic Risk Assessment – in Two Charts By Kip Hansen, WUWT, Nov 15, 2024 Link to: Global Existential Risks A first look at a new U.S. government assessment on the most significant risks facing humanity By Roger Pielke Jr., His Blog, Nov 13, 2024 Questioning European Green Simple, but Still Beyond Chis Bowen’s Ken [Video at bottom of article] By Refe Champion, Quadrant, Nov 14, 2024 Link to: German energy expert says energy transition a mistake By Darren Paker, Engineering News, Oct 18, 2024 “This does not mean that every wind turbine and every solar panel is bad,” Schernikau added, outlining several key issues with grid-scale wind and solar energy, starting with the problem of energy density. Green Blues…As Fog Persists For Days In Germany, Green Energy Output Falls To Near Zero! The enemy of green energy: the high pressure system By KlimaNachrichten, Via P Gosselin, No Tricks Zone, Nov 10, 2024 At 5 p.m. last Wednesday, Germany’s 1602 offshore wind turbines in the North and Baltic Seas stood still…solar output was also near zero. Germany had to scramble to keep supply going. This means that the 87,000 megawatts of photovoltaic capacity and around 72,000 megawatts of wind power installed in Germany with triple-digit billion-euro subsidies were virtually unused for hours on end.

It’s that the issue isn’t “a little bit of short-term pain” it’s long-term wreckage to no purpose. Anyone in the energy industry who assumed it was all just talk, or that cooler heads would prevail, has yet again been given a rude awakening. When they say they want to kill your industry, here’s an insider tip: They want to kill your industry. Litigation Issues Federal Court takes aim at White House’s environment authority By Rachel Frazin, The Hill, Nov 13, 2024 On Tuesday, judges with the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the White House’s Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) cannot issue regulations pertaining to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) — one of the nation’s bedrock environmental laws. Andrew Mergen, an environmental law professor at Harvard, said NEPA is “unique in how sparse it is” meaning that typically, it’s up to administrations to fill in the blanks and tell agencies how these environmental reviews should be conducted. [SEPP Comment: Bureaucrats decide what the law says – a sloppy law.] The climate case of the century By Lucas Bergkamp, Climate Etc., Nov 13, 2024 The Court [Hague Court of Appeal] not only took the IPCC reports as irrebuttable proof, but also attributed normative force to them. For example, the Court ruled that climate scientists have determined that the average temperature on earth may not rise by more than 1.5 degrees. In doing so, the Court, like the Dutch Supreme Court, ignored that science cannot set norms and that scientists are not authorized to set social standards. The Dutch judiciary’s scientistic tendency is extremely worrisome and does not bode well for future climate-related judgments. [SEPP Comment: Although the outcome was good, this practice is sad. In physical science, proof comes from nature, physical evidence, not political bodies like the IPCC.] Climate Litigation: The Dutch Case and a Pattern of Vexatious Lawsuits By Charles Rotter, WUWT, Nov 12, 2024 Cap-and-Trade and Carbon Taxes Farmers warn Labour’s net zero ‘fertiliser tax’ will push up food prices By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Nov 10, 2024 Subsidies and Mandates Forever Another windfarm surpasses £1 billion in subsidy payments Press Release, Net Zero Watch, Nov 14, 2024 EPA and other Regulators on the March EPA implements climate law’s methane fee as Republicans plan repeal By Rachel Frazin, The Hill, Nov 12, 2024 The methane fee passed in the 2022 law through a process called budget reconciliation, which allows certain legislation to evade the filibuster — only requiring 50 votes in the Senate. It passed the House and Senate without a single Republican vote. Energy Issues – Non-US Climate Colonialism’s Role in Nigeria’s Blackouts: A Manufactured Energy Crisis By Charles Rotter, WUWT, Nov 9, 2024 [SEPP Comment: A new Heart of Darkness, a rendering of racism?] Updated CCGT Costs Confirmed As Much Cheaper Than Renewables By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Nov 9, 2024 Given that gas power tends to set the wholesale market price of electricity, currently around £80/MWh, that £14 makes a big difference. Put another way, if the Carbon Pricing scheme was abolished, wholesale prices could potentially drop to £66/MWh. Cold, Hungry, Mass Unemployment, No Cars, Blackouts–Welcome To Starmer’s Dystopian Future By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Nov 15, 2024 Link to fantasy report sponsored by the UK government in 2019: Absolute Zero: Delivering the UK’s climate change commitment with incremental changes to today’s technologies By Julian M. Allwood, Julian, and many others, University of Cambridge, Nov 11, 2019 Executive Summary: We can’t wait for breakthrough technologies to deliver net-zero emissions by 2050. Instead, we can plan to respond to climate change using today’s technologies with incremental change. This will reveal many opportunities for growth but requires a public discussion about future lifestyles. From Homewood: Starmer has just confirmed at COP29 that the UK will formally aim to cut emissions by 81% from 1990 levels by 2035. This means a cut of 65% from current levels.

Energy Issues — US Trump Announces the Creation of the National Energy Council By Charles Rotter, WUWT, Nov 15, 2024 Elon, DOGE, and the Deep: Offshore Energy’s Role in Fiscal Recovery By Erik Milito, Real Clear Energy, Nov 11, 2024 The Gulf of Mexico oil and gas industry supports nearly 400,000 jobs, contributes almost $34 billion to the GDP, and is a key contributor to environmental conservation, restoration, and recreation programs, including virtually all funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF). In 2023 alone, these activities generated over $6 billion in federal revenues, with peaks at $17 billion during high activity periods. This income stream is funded entirely by energy companies from their revenues. Currently, with only three lease sales planned for the Gulf over the next five years, we’re not optimizing our resources. We need annual sales to maintain production levels, encourage investment, and fortify energy independence.

Here is what Wheeler had to say about the idea of rescinding the many anti-fossil fuel regulations adopted by the Bidenauts (near exact quote): “They [the Trump people] only have four years. That’s not enough time to roll back everything they want to roll back.” But my preferred suggestion would be to submit the [Paris] Agreement to the Senate as a treaty. There is zero chance that the Senate would ratify. Rescind the Endangerment Finding [SEPP Comment: For the Paris agreement add a specific time limit for Senate approval.

This new plant will power 385,000 homes and is a great example of Mississippi’s commitment to bringing reliable, available, and affordable energy to our state’s residents and businesses.” Nuclear Energy and Fears The U.S. and Its Nuclear Era By Sarah Rosa , Benton Arnett, Real Clear Energy, Nov 13, 2024 America’s shift away from nuclear power in the 1980s was misguided given that in the U.S.’ 67-year history of nuclear energy production, there has only ever been one incident—that of Three Mile Island Unit 2 in 1979, where there were no injuries or fatalities, and the released radiation was too minimal to have any noticeable health effects on nearby populations. Nuclear energy has, in fact, been found to be one of the safest energy sources available. Three Mile Island Unit 1 safely operated until 2019, when it was shut down for economic reasons. Alternative, Green (“Clean”) Solar and Wind Wind Power Disappears in Germany and UK By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Nov 14, 2024 Even if we, Germany and the others triple wind capacity, it would make little difference. Three times nothing is still nothing. And we cannot all rely on nuclear power from France and hydro from Norway – there is simply not enough to go round. Meanwhile the blind carry on leading the blind! Don’t Rely On Solar Power! By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Nov 11, 2024 The days have been uniformly dull and grey until today, and at its peak on Saturday only hit 877 MW, only 4.9% of capacity. What is the logic of spending billions of pounds on carpeting perfectly good farm land with solar panels which are no use at all in winter? November Wind Slump Has Led To A Strained Energy Supply In Germany…Bottlenecks Threaten By P Gosselin, No Tricks Zone, Nov 13, 2024 The lack of wind power last week led to a tighter energy market in Europe, particularly in central and northern regions and caused a surge in electricity prices, especially in short-term markets. Prices reached a two-year high, exceeding 800 EUR/MWh! As a result, there’s growing concern about the potential for similar price spikes in winter if wind conditions remain weak.

Five Ways to Disaster-Proof the Energy Grid With extreme weather events—and power outages—on the rise, utilities and tech companies are looking at what they can do to keep the lights on in the future By Amy Myers Jaffe, WSJ, Nov 10, 2024 TWTW Summary: Discussed in the This Week section above. “The recent flooding of Valencia, Spain . . . . In 2021 it got rid of 108 dams and weirs; in 2022, another 133. it was Europe’s proud league champion at dismantling them. Last year it was second only to France.” ________________________________________________________________________________ So far, A total of 2,119 dams have been removed in the U.S. since 1912 and more removals are planned (Google search on “dam removal in the us”) I’m waiting for the article that claims the Climate Change is causing more floods. 2,000 years ago… The sparsely populated areas like the fenland – home to the Iceni etc – underwent huge transformation. “Areas of coastal marshland formed an important and distinctive part of the landscape of Roman Britain, and current work is showing that different wetlands were utilised in very different ways. Some areas, for example in Essex and Kent, were simply exploited for their natural resources to produce salt and support seasonal grazing. Parts of Fenland were also used in this way, though the higher coastal siltlands were modified through the creation of drainage systems in order to improve agricultural opportunities within a landscape that was still liable to tidal flooding. A third strategy towards wetland exploitation is reclamation: a major transformation of the natural environment https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/britannia/article/abs/romanobritish-exploitation-of-coastal-wetlands-survey-and-excavation-on-the-north-somerset-levels-19937/5976A1159AF0585E8CF540D01AD6BD4C The autobahn were built primarily with military purposes in mind. I wonder where they got the idea? Roman roads in Britannia were initially designed for military use, they were constructed by the legions during the four centuries that Britannia was a province of the Roman Empire. Some Roman routes form part of the national road network, today. One has, I think, to reflect a little on a time when things got improved in a major way in a relatively short period of time – albeit under Roman occupation – because we are now in a period where things are going into reverse. And deliberately so. The Romans would hold games – somewhat barbaric by ‘today’s standards’ – to entertain the masses. “”“While gladiators have always captured the public imagination, their presence in Britain has been less widely understood. New research has now proven that the spectacles of Rome’s Colosseum were experienced as far away as Colchester.”” https://www.britishmuseum.org/sites/default/files/2024-08/Gladiators-of-Britain.pdf The current elites feed us a constant diet of doom and gloom throughout the spheres “”I’ve dabbled in prepping before, without really realising what I was doing. A fear in the early 2000s that Rimmel might stop making my favourite eyeliner led to me dashing to Boots to buy five. Which is fairly normal, I think? On the spectrum of normal? … The Doomsday Clock is now set at 90 seconds to midnight. Its operators, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, who monitor the combined risks of nuclear annihilation, climate disaster, biological threat and “disruptive technologies”, say we have never been closer to global catastrophic destruction. I’m finally into ‘prepping’ and ready for the apocalypse https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/nov/17/im-finally-into-prepping-and-ready-for-the-apocalypse What will Miliband do for us? To recap… The following SEPP comment is silly on a couple of counts. “There is no explanation on how the heavy CFC molecules get from the surface to the stratosphere. (CCI2F2 [Freon] has an atomic weight of about 121 atomic mass units (amu)).” Gases fill the volume of their container basically due to entropy. Refrigerants are gases. Less volatile gases will migrate (diffuse) more slowly, but mixing occurs in the atmosphere due to winds, thermals, etc. “Atomic” refers to atoms, “molecular” refers to molecules. The molecular weight of a Freon is the sum of its atomic constituents. “According to Matt Ridley, the city of Aragon [actually Zaragoza], Spain, was recently saved by a dam built by the emperor Augustus.” The ancients had good engineers. My uncle was in southern Iraq during WWII. He said he drove his jeep over a stone bridge- a sign next to it said it was built by Alexander the Great! So, why do you think NPR published this bit of news? When will greenhouse gas emissions finally peak? Could be soon “For almost two centuries, greenhouse gas emissions have climbed steadily as humans have burned increasing amounts of oil, gas and coal. Now, climate scientists believe those emissions may finally be reaching a peak…” No time to follow the link yet but I’m guessing its a combo of technologically driven energy efficiency increases, economically driven population growth decreases and wishful thinking. As to why they’d publish a “don’t worry” piece, I think they see the writing on the wall. It’s over? The current temperature spike is about over, so there’s certainly an opportunity to take credit — even is none is due. Okay started reading it… “Studies show emissions must peak and then rapidly decline to limit impacts like more intense heat waves and storms.” Stopped there. “more intense heat waves and storms” “This “backward” nation has planned 100 space launches for 2024 in its goal to put someone on the Moon by 2030.” I think above words were written intending to be ironic but “Neil Armstrong famously said, “That’s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind” on July 20, 1969, as he became the first person to walk on the moon” That was 55 years ago. The famous American astronaut has been dead for about 8 years. American businessmen have gone to space, because, why not? Going to the moon was a technology goal for days gone by, and now that most people believe it really happened 5 decades ago, the natural response would not be “wow!” but rather “why?” Login Become a WUWT Sponsor - click here Free signup if you want to post comments (includes ads) click here “Walk toward the fire.

by IR Staff posted Friday, November 15, 2024 at 1:51 PM EST Black Friday Sony camera sales have landed! Although Sony have branched out into myriad other products besides, they're still one of the top dogs when it comes to both photography and video cameras, as well as the lenses to go with them. See below for the finest deals you'll see all year on these products, plus some advice from us on what you should bear in mind when shopping during this period. Sony Alpha 7 IV Full-frame Mirrorless Camera (body only): $400 OFF at - B&H - Amazon Sony FE 50mm f/1.2 GM: $100 OFF at - B&H - Amazon Sony FE 35mm f/1.4 GM: $100 OFF at - B&H - Amazon Sony FE 40mm f/2.5 G: $50 OFF at - B&H - Amazon Sony FE 14mm f/1.8 GM: $100 OFF at - B&H - Amazon Sony FE 50mm f/1.4 GM: $100 OFF at - B&H - Amazon Black Friday deals on Sony cameras typically start appearing in early to mid-November, as many retailers launch their early Black Friday sales in the weeks leading up to the main event. The biggest discounts are usually available on Black Friday itself, which is the day after Thanksgiving, and continue through Cyber Monday. Retailers like Amazon, B&H Photo Video, Adorama, and Best Buy often begin teasing or releasing discounts on Sony cameras, lenses, and accessories well before the official Black Friday date, so it’s a good idea to start monitoring prices early to secure the best deals. Yes, Black Friday is one of the best times to find deals on Sony cameras, lenses, and accessories. During this period, retailers like B&H Photo Video, Adorama, Amazon, and Best Buy compete to offer some of the year's steepest discounts on Sony gear, including popular models like the Sony Alpha mirrorless cameras and G-Master lenses. You can often find bundle deals that include extra lenses, memory cards, or camera bags at no additional cost, making it an excellent time to maximize value. While Black Friday offers significant savings, the discounts often depend on the product category. Entry-level and mid-range Sony cameras, older models, and discontinued lenses tend to see the most aggressive price cuts. However, newer and high-end models, like the Sony A7R V or Sony FX3, might not be as heavily discounted. All things considered though, Black Friday invariably provides the widest selection of deals in one concentrated shopping window. Several retailers are expected to offer deals on Sony cameras, lenses, and accessories this Black Friday, both online and in-store. B&H Photo Video and Adorama are top destinations, offering discounts on Sony Alpha cameras, lenses, and bundles, often including accessories like memory cards and camera bags. Amazon is another excellent option, featuring a wide range of Black Friday deals, including lightning deals on popular models, lenses, and bundles. You may also find discounts on refurbished Sony products. Best Buy frequently offers promotions on Sony Alpha cameras, point-and-shoot models, and kits, sometimes including extras like tripods or batteries. For members, Costco often provides value-packed bundles on Sony cameras with accessories, especially entry-level and mid-range models. Walmart, though more limited in selection, typically features deals on Sony point-and-shoot cameras and entry-level mirrorless models. Additionally, the Sony Store itself often runs Black Friday promotions, offering discounts on cameras, lenses, and accessories, with exclusive offers for direct purchases. Black Friday deals on Sony cameras and lenses usually begin in mid-November, with many retailers launching early Black Friday sales before the main shopping day. The steepest discounts are typically available from Black Friday itself, the day after Thanksgiving, through Cyber Monday. Some retailers extend these promotions into Cyber Week, lasting until the first few days of December. However, stock for popular Sony products, like Alpha mirrorless cameras and G-Master lenses, often sells out quickly, so it’s best to shop early. While some deals may linger after Cyber Week, the selection and savings tend to diminish as inventory runs low. My Father once told me when I was a young boy: 'never trust anyone in this life, they'll always let you down or stab you in the back, you can only rely on yourself'. Clearly he wasn't aware at the time of the stellar credibility of Imaging Resource when it comes to all things cameras.

Title: Wondering How Much Cheaper Costco Groceries Are? I Did the Math

Reviews ethics statement Costco is known for cheap groceries sold in bulk. If you're wondering how much you can save by joining the membership wholesale club for a year, I did the math to find out. A Costco membership can save you more than $1,000 yearly in groceries alone. Groceries are the biggest ongoing expense for most families after housing and they've seen an annoying tick up since the pandemic and all its supply chain chaos. One way to combat high supermarket prices is buying in bulk and nowhere is that more easily done that at Costco -- well, if you have one in your town or city that is. At Costco, groceries are packaged in larger quantities and sold at cheaper per-pound prices, meaning you can save major dough as long as you have the space to store a 50-pack of paper towels or a 20-pound bag of rice. Shopping at Costco also typically means fewer trips to the store, which will require less gas. To see exactly how much money can you save by buying bulk groceries from Costco, I decided to price out a grocery list at the wholesale club and a more typical grocery store. After running the numbers, it's possible to save over $1,000 in one year by shopping at Costco instead of a supermarket. Below is a breakdown of how I reached that figure. (And if you get a Costco Executive membership, you could save even more.) Using grocery list templates available online, I assembled a list of 25 typical, staple grocery items that are suitable for longer storage, either in the pantry, refrigerator or freezer. This ruled out most fresh produce with some exceptions. If you're hosting a large gathering, buying produce in bulk may be worthwhile. Bulk shopping doesn't mean buying a year's worth of groceries all at once, but I didn't include anything that wouldn't hold up well for at least a month, with the notion that bulk grocery shopping can be done less often. Bulk buying also requires spending more upfront, which is why Costco's per-item total is considerably higher than Stop & Shop's. Assuming either bi-weekly or monthly consumption of those staple grocery items for a household of one or two people, I came up with the approximate yearly consumption for each. I chose Stop & Shop to represent a conventional grocery retailer, as it's largely considered to be a quality store with median prices, and Costco to represent bulk buying, as its Kirkland Signature products have a bit of a following in their own right -- Costco is the Trader Joe's of the bulk set, for sure. Unless a national brand is otherwise indicated, I used Stop & Shop's SB brand, or the least expensive name-brand product for a given item, to compare to Costco's Kirkland Signature brand. For the Stop & Shop items, coming up with the yearly price for each item was a simple matter of multiplying by 26 for bi-weekly consumption, or 12 for monthly consumption. For Costco's items, I scaled the prices accordingly based on whatever package size Costco offers to indicate a yearly cost for the same amount of a given item. If you can afford the freezer space, buying meat in bulk will save you big money over the course of a year. Since I was primarily interested in food cost savings, I didn't factor in cleaning supplies, paper products or other items, but you can safely assume these also amount to big saving potential over the year when bought in bulk. Also, since my calculations were based on a small household, the bigger your household, the bigger the savings. Costco requires a membership to take advantage of its bulk savings and low-cost signature brands. A basic membership costs $65 a year and is valid at all locations. Read more about the different Costco membership options. The economics of buying in bulk is simple: The more you buy of something at one time, the less it costs per count or unit of weight. Producers, distributors and retailers are able to offer lower prices this way not only because bulk items often require less packaging, but also because for them it's a sure sale over a potential sale -- they'd rather have your money now, even at a discount, than parsed out over a period of time. Shelf-stable items including cereal, sauces and coffee make up some of the biggest savings when buying in bulk. Given this particular grocery list, buying in bulk would allow you to save over $1,000 during the course of a year, representing a 33% savings overall over conventional groceries. (In today's economy, it is worth mentioning that you also save gas money with fewer trips to the store.) In a few cases, the Stop & Shop item ended up being the cheaper option: organic milk, carrots, potatoes and frozen salmon filets, for example. In all of these cases, there wasn't a huge size difference between the conventional and bulk items. Milk is an especially good example, as it's still offered in a larger quantity at Costco, but there's only so much of it you can buy at one time without risking it spoiling, and so the bulk offering is comparatively modest. Costco also doesn't have a Kirkland brand offering of organic milk, whereas Stop & Shop does. The savings for bulk fresh produce were not as significant as pantry staples and shelf-stable groceries. Generally speaking, the larger the scale on the bulk item, the larger the savings. If you buy a 40-ounce quantity of Cheerios, for example, rather than the 12 ounces you get in a typical box, they become nearly 75% cheaper. Buying 25 pounds of white rice all at once instead of 2 pounds at a time saves you 60%. With at least a grand in savings available yearly for just a portion of your grocery list, even if you need to buy additional home storage to accommodate it, the verdict is clear: Bulk grocery shopping is well worth the effort. Some of the biggest savings by percentage come from shelf-stable and pantry items including chips, crackers, jarred sauce, rice and whole-bean coffee. These items are typically easier to store and less likely to spoil or deteriorate in quality. Buying pantry items in bulk from a discount grocer such as Costco represents a clear and risk-free strategy for saving money on your grocery bill bill the course of a year. If you're a Costco shopper, make sure you check out how to maximize your Costco savings, and how much you can save with a Costco Executive membership. And for more We Do the Math, check out how much you can save by shopping at Trader Joe's compared to other grocery stores, and if it's cheaper to buy meal kits than groceries.

When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. If you’re looking for a deal on anything Apple sells—an iPad, Apple Watch, AirPods, MacBook, or anything else, there’s no better time to get one than Black Friday. No matter what you’re looking to buy, you’re going to find a great price—possibly the lowest ever. The sales start earlier every year, but the best deals are usually seen between Black Friday (November 29) and Cyber Monday (December 2). However, we’re already seeing fantastic deals, so you might not want to wait. We’ll be updating this page regularly as more discounts come in and as soon as Apple announces its own Black Friday 2024 shopping event. Black Friday is a great time to get an Apple product for less, but the discounts come and go very quickly. Stay tuned to this page throughout the Black Friday weekend as we update you with the best prices on new Apple products as they arrive. Many of the best deals we see are on Amazon U.S. or Amazon U.K., but we’ll also be checking resellers such as Best Buy, B&H and Walmart in the U.S. and KRCS, AO, Argos, John Lewis, Currys, Laptops Direct and eBuyer in the U.K. Apple released new MacBook Pros with M4 chips in late October. At the same time, it upgraded the RAM in all MacBook Air models from 8GB to 16GB for the same starting prices, effectively a $200/£200 discount. So if you’re shopping make sure the model you’re buying has 16GB of RAM. We don’t recommend buying a model with 8GB of RAM even if it’s $200/£200 cheaper than the 16GB model. U.S. Foundry Additionally, Apple’s older MacBook Pro models are on clearance as retailers look to clear out remaining stock: U.K. Apple’s older MacBook models are on clearance at the following retailers: The iMac and Mac mini both received new M4 chips in October, with the Mac mini also getting a dramatic redesign that shrunk the case down to just 5 inches. Like the MacBooks, these new Macs now start at 16GB of RAM, an option that was previously an extra $200/£200. So be sure to double-check that you’re buying the updated model with an M4 processor. Older iMacs only offer 8GB of RAM, so the price should match that. Grab money off a new iMac. Foundry U.S. There are big savings are on the older models as well: U.K. In the U.K. when Apple announced the iMac and Mac mini in 2024 it dropped prices compared to the previous generation, so keep this in mind if considering a discount on an M3 model. These older models are also discounted: The AirPods 4 with and without ANC are Apple’s newest earbuds. Apple updated the AirPods Max with a USB-C port in September, but otherwise, it’s the same as the Lightning model. And while the AirPods Pro 2 are a couple of years old, Apple added a new feature in iOS 18,1 that lets it work as a hearing aid. We usually see some tremendous savings on the standard AirPods over Black Friday. You may also see a blowout deal on the older models, but unless you’re on a very tight budget, our advice is that even if you see a good deal on the AirPods 3 you should spring for one of the AirPods 4 models on sale even if they cost more. The AirPods 4 without ANC cost $129/£129 and compare very favorably with the AirPods 3 which used to cost $179/£179. AirPods 4 are Apple’s newest earbuds and are already on sale. Petter Ahrnstedt U.S. U.K. There are also savings on older models, but as we mentioned above, we recommend skipping any AirPods 3rd gen deals because the AirPods 4 are much better. Mike Sawh Apple launched the Apple Watch Series 10 with a slightly larger screen in September 2024 as well as a new black color for the Apple Watch Ultra. Traditionally, any savings around $50 is an excellent deal. U.S. U.K. Apple updated all of its iPads in 2024 with the exception of the 10th-gen entry-level model (though it did get a price cut to $349). The iPad mini was the most recent model to get a refresh, with a new chip and 8GB of RAM. We are seeing some good deals on new iPads. Foundry U.S. U.K. U.S. Most iPhone deals in the U.S. are through carriers and require a trade-in or adding a new line. You can read our best Black Friday iPhone deals roundup for more information. U.K. David Price / Foundry In October, Apple updated its Mac accessories with USB-C ports but didn’t bring any other changes. If you’re buying a new Apple Pencil the Apple Pencil Pro is the newest model and compatible with the iPad Pro, iPad Air, and iPad mini. The USB-C Apple Pencil is also compatible with these models as well as the 10th-gen iPad, but doesn’t have squeeze gestures or magnetic charging. Thiago Trevisan/Foundry U.S. U.K. Every year Apple holds a shopping event from Black Friday (November 29) to Cyber Monday (December 2). However, since Apple rarely discounts its products, the event consists of gift card offers rather than actual savings. The newest products are excluded, so don’t expect any offers on the iPhone 16 or new MacBooks, but in 2023 the Apple Watch Series 9 was included. In 2023 you could get gift cards for the following amounts with the following purchases made on Apple’s U.S. site or Apple’s U.K. site. Stay tuned to Macworld throughout November to find the best deals as they arrive. But if you’re looking for a specific color or capacity, you can check out the following retailers. In the U.S., here are the best stores to shop for Black Friday deals: If you’re based in the U.K., you’ll find deals at the following shops: Check out these Lightning tech deals before they go.

Title: The Influencers Going Viral in Aisle 8

Time Published: 2024-11-14T13:00:00Z
Full Content:
With young people in the grip of a cost-of-living crisis, TikTok creators are turning grocery runs into rich-girl-coded productions—and followers are eating it up. I’m sitting in a Costco parking lot, staring at my Instacart app. It’s my ﬁrst week as a shopper, and all morning long, I’ve been at supermarkets in the sprawling, affluent community of Summerlin, Nevada, locations where the algorithm has detected a high likelihood that a customer will enlist my services. Except no one has, which means I’m currently making less than the $22 I spent on the insulated grocery bag Instacart recommended as part of its “best practices.” I have 18 miles of gas left. Anxiety is starting to kick in. I open TikTok and type “Instacart how to get orders”—and instead get my first taste of a genre that will ultimately suck me in for weeks. The initial video I stumble on shows a young woman named Shelly Kowatch in skintight workout gear surrounded by groceries in her kitchen. She and her husband “fucked up real bad,” she explains, holding up a large cardboard box of items, and blew $737.14 on a single Costco trip. With naughty delight, she displays the items one by one: frozen açaí packs, chicken sausage, turkey bacon, a whole watermelon, yogurt tubes, a jumbo pack of cream cheese, guacamole packs, and on and on. “There’s so much shit, I can’t even keep it organized right now,” she says. I’m at once mesmerized and unsettled, because what should be the blandest of content—a trip to Costco, the decidedly unglamorous warehouse club known for its discounted prices—is suddenly pinging my lifestyle envy. I skim the video’s 668 comments and see I’m not alone. “How do you afford thisss,” one viewer writes, adding two crying-face emojis. Another chimes in, “My broke ass couldn’t.” Says someone else, “I hope I can eventually be at the point where I accidentally spend $700 at Costco.” And that’s when I get it: It’s not the store itself that feels so seductive; it’s the idea of being able to stock up at all. In this economy? As a grad student in Las Vegas (and with Nevada having the country’s fourth-highest household grocery costs), I can attest it’s become very difficult to put food on the table with the $30,000 annual stipend I get for teaching and other academic duties. Hence my Instacart gig—and my insta-fascination with this budding corner of TikTok. Soon, through hashtags like #SupermarketHaul and #LuxuryGroceries, I’m scrolling through thousands of videos geared toward evoking a strange yearning. Some are like that first one, almost normcore in their casual redefinition of excess. Others catapult viewers across the ever-expanding wealth divide into an otherworldly domain where you can (vicariously) spend $88 on edible sea moss gel. But all these young female influencers cruising the aisles with nary a care underline a unifying truth: For a lot of us, the act of buying the exact foods we like, of nourishing ourselves on our own terms, now feels like an increasingly rarefied one. Back in that parking lot, my Instacart finally buzzes with an order. A customer has purchased a single rotisserie chicken…and nothing more. I’ll earn just $14 for delivering it, but I don’t feel I have much choice. I go inside, pick up the bird, and drive 40 minutes to a neighborhood almost 20 miles away. As instructed, I leave the bag outside a beautiful stucco house. I spend my $14 on gas, go home, lie on the floor, and watch more grocery content. People have always been obsessed with how the “haves” spend their money, a spectator sport driven by fascination, envy, sometimes bitterness. As a millennial raised on the internet, I’ve been watching luxury unboxings since the dawn of YouTube influencer culture: Sephora outings with unlimited budgets, ribbon-tied packages from Hermès—videos that served viewers like myself a thrilling peek at devil-may-care consumption. What kind of person spends such ridiculous sums on their face? I’d wonder. But also: How incredible would that be? Pummeled by an affordability crisis that has engulfed everything from housing to health care, young adults have only dialed up the digital window-shopping. A recent survey found that Gen Z now devotes over three hours a day, more than any other generation, to browsing fantasy purchases online. Think: historic homes that cost 200 times your annual rent, bucket-list vacations at 5-star resorts, Jil Sander boots. And now...ground beef? A pound of the stuff costs 43 percent more than it did four years ago. In fact, U.S. food prices have climbed so steeply—25 percent on average between 2019 and 2023—that in August, presidential nominee Kamala Harris announced an economic policy platform that would include the first-ever federal ban on grocery price gouging. Recent research suggests that young women struggle with food insecurity at higher rates than young men, meaning we’re less likely to get the basic nutrition we need for a healthy life. All of which makes what’s happening on TikTok feel even more dystopian. Brooke Baevsky, a 29-year-old private chef in Los Angeles catering to celebrities like Paris Hilton and Adam Sandler, has built a 732,000-strong social following with a stream of stridently aspirational supermarket content. She often records herself shopping for goods at the high-end grocer Erewhon, which has 10 locations across Los Angeles. In a video from March, Baevsky fills two carts, then holds a long scroll of a receipt in front of the camera. The total is over $2,900. A viral upload from last spring with more than 638,000 Likes shows Baevsky sourcing ingredients for a pizza appetizer a client requested. Into her cart go organic figs, adaptogenic mushroom powders, gluten-free flour, $35 balsamic vinegar, a $42 flask of olive oil, and two $26 bottles of purified water, all on top of the extra-extra-special ingredients Baevsky purchased elsewhere: $200 caviar, New Zealand manuka honey, edible 24-karat gold flakes. “Did I feel poor after watching this? Yes,” one commenter writes. “Did I enjoy watching it? Also yes.” Baevsky acknowledges her content acts like an irresistible lens into the country’s sharpening class disparities. “People will go to these stores as tourists just to see them, like a museum, and they’re like, Who buys this stuff? What is it used for? So I kind of answer that question,” she tells me. And she’s blunt about what makes a successful haul video: “showing the outlandish foods that most people in the country do not have.” On other TikTok accounts, creators make sticker shock into a game. A May video with 10,600 comments stars user Vanessa Nagel and a companion at an Erewhon location trying to estimate the price of a large container of prepared mixed berries. One guesses $19; the other guesses $24. Real price: $41.18. It’s a little rage-bait-y (“This is the Hunger Games,” one commenter declares), yet viewers can’t look away. During an anthropological visit to an Erewhon this summer, I myself witnessed multiple groups of young women filming their bewilderment over prices...and gawking at the “real” customers. “Are you from Pretty Little Liars?” a teen girl yelled at a handsome man perusing Wagyu beef with his Australian shepherd. In stark contrast to all this, Baevsky stresses to me that she teaches after-school cooking classes for families facing food insecurity, work that’s close to her heart. She grew up in a western Massachusetts county where nearly half of all households currently lack reliable access to nutritious food. On her social channels, she makes a point to integrate cooking tips for followers on any budget. But nothing does numbers quite like the fantasy excursions. A couple of summers ago, I spent my school hiatus in Los Angeles pretending to be someone with money. That wasn’t my intention—I was supposed to be living frugally while researching a novel—but soon after I arrived, I began living as a woman who takes hot yoga classes and scours flea markets for vintage denim. The bougie neighborhood supermarket was a constant lure, with its imported cheeses, cold-pressed juices, and fresh-cut flowers. I wanted so badly to be the kind of person who could buy these things that I found myself taking out my credit card again and again. TikTok has no shortage of grocery girlies engaged in similar games of economic make-believe, but today’s cohort comes with a twist of wry transparency and a (grim? refreshing?) recognition that sustaining this lifestyle would actually be impossible. One post filmed outside a Whole Foods shows creator Alina Ayoub pushing a cart of brown paper bags. White text across the screen reads, “Cosplaying a rich housewife who only eats organic and doesn’t care about the financial repercussions of an $8 cucumber.” “Cosplaying L.A. influencer is my new favorite hobby,” a user named Kayla Ronquillo captioned a March clip. The video shows her posted up in an outdoor seating area at Erewhon with some of the store’s buzziest items: buffalo cauliflower, gluten-free mac and cheese, the spicy tuna sushi sandwich (“of course”), and a Winnie Harlow x Steens Honey x Erewhon Island Glow Smoothie made with organic blue spirulina powder, red dragon fruit, and vanilla collagen peptides. “Don’t ask me how much I spent,” she says to the camera. To do so would disturb this open-source identity experiment. Some videos incorporate actual aspects of dress-up. At another Whole Foods, registered dietitian Taylor Grasso is seen costumed in a jean jacket and baseball cap, tousled waves spilling out as she saunters down an aisle. Her mission: “pretend you’re a hot, rich suburban mom who buys all her groceries from here.” A July TikTok from beauty influencer Anna Annora offers an aesthetic manual for this kind of consumer, what she calls “the Trader Joe’s girl phenomenon,” where women somehow appear glowy, gorgeous, and spiritually unbothered as they browse for yogurt and toilet paper. All it takes are 12 simple steps: a faint wash of stain dabbed on lips and cheekbones, a bit of spot concealer, strategic shimmery contour, filled-in brows, a smoky smudge of eyeliner, nose stippled with a ColourPop Freckle Pen in Soft Brown, setting powder, a second application of blush, a quick lash curl, mascara, buffed-out lip liner, and a swipe of gloss. Go even deeper into the valley of GroceryTok and you’ll find more echoes of OG beauty and style content. A July haul from creator Kiki Somers features a package of free-range organic chicken breasts presented for the camera like an eyeshadow palette. Other users hold up meatballs, milk, and ice pops in similar fashion. A January clip from user Danielle Demi captures an ironic “unboxing” in which she fawns over a few items from Whole Foods, like a $9 glass vessel of sesame-ginger salad dressing. Drumming her manicured hand on a metallic package of butter, she adds, “Oooh, gold.” Intentionally or not, these creators are performing a sort of reverse engineering, in which everyday fare attains divine status. Something must explain these ungodly prices, the videos seem to imply. Sometimes, like with that butter, it happens in passing. Other times, there’s an entire content universe devoted to a specific luxe item, like Oishii-brand Omakase strawberries, native to the Japanese Alps and known for their creamy sweetness. The Oishii company claims to have designed the optimal year-round growing climate at “the world’s largest indoor vertical strawberry farm”—in New Jersey—and delegates harvesting duties to state-of-the-art robots. For $11.99 to $19.99, you get a sleek container of 11 berries, each nestled in its own protective divot. “Worth it just for the packaging alone,” Meg Radice of @TheVIPList says in a TikTok review. In an April TikTok with 1.1 million Likes, creator Lizzie Dushaj conducts a taste test of Penny Pound Ice–brand cocktail ice from Erewhon. The bag contains eight 2.4-inch spheres of frozen water and costs $30. “Oh my god—this looks like a crystal ball,” she says, holding up a melting orb. “I can’t afford bread,” someone writes in the comments. Lifestyle creator Kayla Brown is done with freewheeling supermarket splurges, even though she once was somewhat known for them. Several years ago, the 29-year-old began sharing grocery hauls on TikTok and admits she used to shop with a money-is-no-object mentality. “I was just like, Oh, this color matches the fridge; this would be great in the TikTok where I do the restock,” she tells me. Then her followers started to push back. “The comments would be like, ‘Well, this is not realistic’; ‘It’s so expensive’; ‘How much did you spend on this?’” The discourse helped Brown rethink her habits—and content strategy. Lately, in an effort to be more relatable (and cut down on food waste), she’s been shopping with a list, and her posts offer a different kind of thrill: sensory delights minus existential stress. In a June video, you hear the pleasing clack of soft-drink cans being placed into a cart, the rattle of shelled pistachios, the soft thump of chicken cutlets hitting the heap, and the rustle of matching cream-colored shopping bags sliding perfectly into a car trunk, all with a soft overdub of Sabrina Carpenter’s “Please Please Please.” Here, the supermarket is not a seat of modern financial anxiety. Instead, viewers feel like they’re in a gentle cocoon, a dreamy realm where their debit card will never be declined. “So satisfying,” someone says in the comments. Brown, who is based in Salt Lake City, has a specific process for stirring such responses. After she puts together a video, she closes her eyes, takes in the audio element, and makes adjustments much like a music producer would. “It’s like a rhythm or a beat,” she says. “Is this clip too quiet? Was there a squeaky noise that wasn’t satisfying?” She also has certain visual trademarks, like showing a bright-red Target shopping cart at the outset, a cue that gets casual users to stop and watch, she theorizes. And she mostly keeps her face out of frame. “You scroll upon this video and it’s kind of a relief, like you’re not trying to connect with another human,” Brown explains. “You’re resetting your mindset. It’s a dopamine release.” Others are leveraging a similar approach, a tranquilizing take on grocery procurement that you don’t need a lot of money to experience IRL...or do you? I enjoy a similar flood of calm while watching an April grocery video from YouTuber Paige Turner, where I’m treated to a whispery voyage through a near-deserted Whole Foods. Turner taps her long silver fingernails against jars of organic fruit spread and packages of ancient grain crackers. She runs her fingers over inscribed bars of natural soap. The sense of tactile access, of actually holding items in hand, is very much part of the fantasy—at least for viewers like me. At the chain supermarket where I shop in Las Vegas, entire aisles of items are locked up behind anti-theft panels, which seems to be a growing norm in lower-income communities. No longer can you freely pick things up, read the labels, and decide if you want them. You have to ask permission, over and over again, from the employee with the key. After a supermarket haul comes the great kitchen restock. This is the genus of TikTok grocery content that delivers the intense payoff of watching an empty fridge suddenly fill with food. It represents a potent promise fulfilled: In this house, no one goes to bed hungry. For me, the queen of kitchen restocks is Summer Reign Henning, an Atlanta-based content creator and entrepreneur with 2 million TikTok followers. While home organizing is her broader specialty, kitchen restocks are her highest-performing fodder. Her most viral to date, a 2023 video with more than 40 million views, opens with her husband, Ryan, steam cleaning the family’s empty fridge in preparation for a $1,000 influx. From there, Henning removes each item from its original packaging and transfers it to one of many clear containers. There are carafes for milk and juice, a multi-tier egg tray, crisper bins for greens, pull-out bins for snacks, and a special hourglass-style pickle jar that allows you to separate spears from their brine. Some of Henning’s followers gravitate to the Pinterest-y appeal of her system—the creation of order in a chaotic world. And then there are viewers like me, who dream of opening their fridges to find tasty things in seemingly infinite supply. “It looks like a storefront,” Henning says. “Everything is easily accessible. The drink dispenser—when you take one can out, another comes behind it.” Pure magic. “I want my future like this low-key,” one viewer writes. “Literally the level of adulthood I’m trying to get to,” comments another. A number of fans beg Henning to just adopt them. After speaking with her, I reflect on the summer I’d had before I started the Instacart job. I was back in Los Angeles to revise that novel. I got a cat-sitting gig in a wealthy area near Griffith Park and arranged to stay in the stylish apartment of the owner—a retired set decorator—for free. She’d left a few items in her fridge for me: sliced turkey, Swiss cheese, sourdough. Should be enough for a sandwich, read a yellow Post-it note. It was a far cry from Henning’s epic restocks, but it was enough to make me feel cared for. That too was magic. So what if I was an interloper in that nice neighborhood? Maybe I wasn’t cosplaying anymore. My university operates a food pantry for students, staff, and faculty. I applaud its existence and yet have always stopped short of going in. Too embarrassed to admit I might need this kind of support, I’ve driven past, not slowing down, not wanting the shame of seeing my own car in the parking lot. Now I wonder if the real aspirational move might be pulling up. On a whim, I search “food pantry haul” on TikTok. I click on a July video from a creator named Alyshia Abbascia titled “Food Pantry Haul as a Single Mom.” The clip shows Abbascia arriving home with bags of groceries from a North Carolina food pantry. As she places them on the floor, she says, “This is something that I never thought I’d be sharing on the internet. It’s something I don’t even share with the people that I know.” Viewers, myself included, are glad she did. There are more than 1,800 comments. “I would love to be part of your village and place a grocery pickup order for you if you’d let me.” “I am so proud of you. You are doing the best that you can and you should be celebrated.” “No shame, Queen. You are not alone. It’s hard as hell out here, but we are all holding on!” I watch a few other food pantry hauls. Creators marvel over boxes of potatoes, spaghetti, lentils, and nuts, emphasizing how happy they are to have overcome the self-consciousness of seeking help. The videos contain zero fantasy: no talk of product aesthetics, no ASMR, no influencer vibes. Here, at the end of the scroll, I may have finally found my place, where all strawberries—any strawberries—taste amazing.
