Costco vs. Xbox bust up reportedly confirmed, as the retailer says plans to ditch Xbox consoles was a "business decision," without providing specifics. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. What does Xbox and Ferrari have in common? Well, primarily you can say they're pretty expensive. In the United States and beyond, Microsoft has been gradually raising the price of its Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S hardware. However, United States customers are feeling the pinch the hardest, owing to President Trump's tariff blitz on foreign imports. The vast majority of Xbox console hardware is manufactured in China, which is subject to a variety of duties that impacts cost. Some types of electronics are exempt, such as traditional computers and smartphones. Video game consoles, however, are not exempt. In response, Microsoft has raised the price of Xbox Series X|S consoles not once, but twice in the United States. When importing Xbox console stock from China, Microsoft has to pay a tax to the United States government, which disrupts the wafer-thin to non-existent profit margin on console hardware. Microsoft, like most other manufacturers (PlayStation included) have been passing on the cost to consumers, leading to higher prices. Some retailers don't seem happy with the new price points. Costco is one such retailer. This week, we wrote about reports that Costco has begun removing Xbox hardware and accessories from its store shelves — not just in the U.S., but globally. Microsoft and Costco haven't really issued a statement through typical channels, but former IGN journalist and video game commentator Destin Legarie says he's managed to get a statement out of the company. Just called Costco about Xbox stock. I was told that they will no longer be carrying Xbox consoles. “We don’t have any plans going forward to carry an Xbox console.” Saying. It was a business decision.They did say they have some great deals on Switch & PlayStation, though.September 25, 2025 "Just called Costco about Xbox stock," Destin's post on X reads. "I was told that they will no longer be carrying Xbox consoles. 'We don't have plans going forward to carry an Xbox console,' saying it was a business decision. They did have some great deals on Switch and PlayStation, though." For our part, we can confirm that this isn't just a blip or typical stock shortage. Costco has indeed been removing Xbox console hardware and has them on clearance sales in certain regions. Something is definitely going on, but Microsoft has so far declined to comment. All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. Microsoft has had a tough generation for Xbox hardware. Still reeling from the negative reception of the Xbox One, Microsoft hasn't really ever recovered its competitive edge against PlayStation's competing solution. But, the industry has changed. Despite hardware sales being anaemic, Microsoft has found success moving its popular franchises to PlayStation and PC. Xbox Series X|S also punches well above its weight. Xbox Game Pass, which is only available within the Microsoft gaming ecosystem, is a huge driver of the business. Despite having a smaller install base on paper, Xbox users are often reported to be disproportionately engaged and spendy. Microsoft's "Everything is an Xbox" strategy has been a winner thus far, with the gaming division outpacing Windows itself as a cornerstone of Microsoft's overall business pie. Despite the hardware struggles on paper, the Xbox ecosystem arguably enjoys better support from developers than ever, with Square Enix returning to the platform with Final Fantasy, and PlayStation itself publishing Helldivers 2 on Xbox Series X|S this summer, too. Still, losing a major retailer like Costco does raise questions. Microsoft's next-gen Xbox hardware is widely expected to be Windows-oriented and PC-like, enabling OEMs like ASUS to potentially construct their own Xbox compatible PCs for the living room too. The very interesting PC handheld Xbox Ally is the first glimpse at that strategy, set to launch on October 16, 2025. It doesn't look like Costco will be part of the fun, though. There's plenty of others still willing to carry Xbox hardware, though, as you can see below.

Title: Trump's new H-1B visa fee could cost companies a lot more than $100K. Here's the potential impact across industries.

Hello, and RIP to Instagram (sort of). The app is testing out a new feed that opens right into its Reels feature. BI's Katie Notopoulos has more on the change. In other tech news, OpenAI's Sam Altman (yes, the Sam Altman) stopped by the Berlin headquarters of our parent company, Axel Springer. He chatted with the father of quantum computing, and they agreed on a Turing Test 2.0. In today's big story, we're looking at how President Donald Trump's new H-1B visa fee will impact Big Tech, startups, consulting, and Wall Street. What's on deck: Markets: The future of trading is … doing it in person. Wait, what? Tech: The startups making big money by training AI with humans. Business: Costco's new exclusive hours are proving to be a boon for the business. But first, the price of hiring just went up. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. The dust is still settling on President Donald Trump's new H-1B visa fee, but one thing seems clear: Corporate America is in for a shake-up. Late last week, Trump sent businesses into a bit of a tailspin when he announced that each H-1B visa, which allows companies to hire foreign skilled workers for specialized roles, would come with a $100,000 fee. There was some initial confusion about whether that fee applied to current visa holders (it doesn't). But even with the focus only on new visa applicants, the impact is still expected to be big. JPMorgan economists predict the US will see work authorizations drop by 5,500 a month. Business leaders continue to weigh in, with reactions ranging from optimism to concern. And while a lot still remains unknown, we're getting a sense of what it means for different industries. Here's a breakdown on how the new fee could impact some of the industries that rely on the H-1B visa the most. Big Tech: Tech giants are some of the biggest users of H-1B visas, so you'd think the new fee would hurt them the most. But size matters. When your company is worth more than $1 trillion, an extra $100,000 won't move the needle. In fact, you could argue that Big Tech would welcome the fee if it served as a deterrent to smaller competitors going after the same talent. Still, it's not all good news. The scale at which Big Tech companies hire workers on H-1B visas means the costs could eventually add up to billions of dollars for top sponsors. Startups: It's easy to think of startups as high-flying companies with lofty valuations, but the vast majority of them are simply small businesses. And without the deep pockets of their larger peers, startups could be left scrambling in the all-important war for talent. Even if a startup is willing to pay the $100,000 fee, it will almost certainly only do it for the most senior-level employees who have the skills and salary to justify the cost. You could argue that was the original intent of the visa, but the change could also upend the pipeline of young talent working at startups. Consulting: When it rains, it pours. Consultants aren't in a position of power, as we've covered here before, and the fee certainly won't help things. Simply put, consulting is experiencing a talent crisis, and any additional hurdle is likely to make it worse. In some cases, like data scientists and other highly technical roles, the competition for talent will just increase. However, building out offshore hubs in places like India, Mexico, the Philippines, and Argentina, which was already a trend, could be another option to bypass the visa issue entirely, analysts told BI. Wall Street: Financial firms aren't too far behind Big Tech when it comes to using H-1B visas. JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and Citigroup each have more than a 1,000 certified H-1B filings. However, the calculation of H-1Bs on the Street is different than in Big Tech. A majority of financial firms' H-1B visa roles are focused on technology. And as much as banks and investment firms value their digital transformations, techies aren't as high in the hierarchy as money makers like traders, investment bankers, and wealth managers. Still, the visa feel will be felt on the Street, especially when it comes to Wall Street's junior banker hiring. 1. This retail investing platform wants to take trading IRL. Moomoo is opening a physical retail store in 2026, located in NYC's Herald Square. With human employees there to help, its CEO sees the storefront as an opportunity to increase brand trust and community engagement. 2. The US economy's greatest strength could turn out to be investors' biggest weakness. America's economic resilience has allowed it to escape many recession forecasts over the years. But that could create a blind spot, financial pros told BI. One strategist said investors' complacency is reminiscent of the 1990s. 3. This lowkey billionaire is the real winner of the new iPhone launch. Wang Laisheng's company, Luxshare Precision Industry, started out making accessories for Apple. Now, it assembles iPhones — and the recent iPhone 17 launch sent its stock spiking 32% and Laisheng's net worth to $14.3 billion. The success has even OpenAI knocking on its door. 1. AI companies are shelling out for human trainers. Companies are raising billions to recruit humans to teach chatbots everything from Japanese to finance to memes. Workers can earn hundreds of dollars an hour at some of these companies. See which startups are cashing in. 2. Post-IPO is not the time to rest on your laurels. As Klarna's staff celebrated its $15 billion IPO at its employee conference in Stockholm, CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski shared a stark text he received from chairman Michael Moritz: Klarna was still "10 years behind" a competitor. 3. Keep your friends close. Abridge became a $5.3 billion darling of healthcare tech with the help of medical records giant Epic. Now, Epic is releasing its own tech to compete with Abridge's AI medical scribe. It shows how partners and former shareholders can quickly become competitors. 1. Where does Trump vs. Kimmel go next? It's possible that the president will simply move on from his beef with Kimmel. But regardless of the aftermath, we should still take the whole ordeal seriously, writes BI's Peter Kafka. It's also shown Corporate America that there's one line it can't cross when it comes to free speech. 2. Costco is proving the haters wrong. Some employees were concerned that Costco's plans to open stores early for its executive members would backfire. Foot traffic data from Placer.ai says otherwise. The data indicates that the extended hours are getting customers to shop faster and more frequently. 3. Trump's economic holy trinity is a tough nut to crack. The president has three economic goals: boost US manufacturing, crack down on immigration, and keep prices low. These work fine on their own, or even in pairs, but many economists and trade experts say Trump can't accomplish all three at once. Here's why. Luigi Mangione's federal judge orders DOJ to stop making prejudicial pretrial statements after Trump retweets. Jimmy Kimmel's comeback show reached 6.26 million viewers, Disney says. Sean Combs launched a jailhouse 'Free Game with Diddy' course to teach fellow inmates business skills: lawyers. Disney investors demand internal records on Jimmy Kimmel's suspension, say the board may have breached duties. Honda ends production of its Acura EV in the US, citing 'market conditions.' Nexstar says it's 'engaged in productive discussions' with Disney but won't show Jimmy Kimmel yet. Dan DeFrancesco, deputy executive editor and anchor, in New York.

Title: How To Earn $500 A Month From Costco Stock Ahead Of Q4 Earnings

Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ: COST) will release earnings results for the fourth quarter, after the closing bell on Thursday, Sept. 25. Analysts expect the company to report quarterly earnings at $5.81 per share, up from $5.29 per share in the year-ago period. COST projects quarterly revenue of $86.06 billion, compared to $79.7 billion a year earlier, according to data from Benzinga Pro. Costco has beaten analyst estimates for revenue in two straight quarters and in five of the last 10 quarters overall. With the recent buzz around Costco, some investors may also be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends. Currently, Costco offers an annual dividend yield of 0.55%, which is a semi-annual dividend amount of $1.30 per share ($5.20 a year). So, how can investors exploit its dividend yield to pocket a regular $500 monthly? To earn $500 per month or $6,000 annually from dividends alone, you would need an investment of approximately $1,090,842 or around 1,154 shares. For a more modest $100 per month or $1,200 per year, you would need $218,357 or around 231 shares. To calculate: Divide the desired annual income ($6,000 or $1,200) by the dividend ($5.20 in this case). So, $6,000 / $5.20 = 1,154 ($500 per month), and $1,200 / $5.20 = 231 shares ($100 per month). Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time. How that works: The dividend yield is computed by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stock’s current price. For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and is currently priced at $50, the dividend yield would be 4% ($2/$50). However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price falls to $40, the dividend yield rises to 5% ($2/$40). Similarly, changes in the dividend payment can impact the yield. If a company increases its dividend, the yield will also increase, provided the stock price stays the same. Conversely, if the dividend payment decreases, so will the yield. COST Price Action: Shares of Costco rose 0.2% to close at $945.27 on Wednesday.

Title: The Financial Sector Was Tottering Even Before Trump
URL: https://newrepublic.com/article/200901/financial-sector-tottering-private-equity
Time Published: 2025-09-25T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
I’ve written a good bit about the economic wreckage wrought by President Donald Trump’s economic policies—tariffs, manipulation of the Federal Reserve, a deficit-doubling tax cut for the rich—and how these might tank the economy. Today let’s consider how, even if Trump weren’t president, the finance sector could tank the economy all by its lonesome through shadow banking, most especially in the private equity industry. The term “shadow banking” was coined in 2007 by a money manager named Paul McCulley to describe financial institutions that mimic what commercial banks do—money markets, mortgage companies, investment banks, hedge funds, and, yes, private equity—but are not regulated like banks. It’s called shadow banking because these firms lack banks’ transparency. Shadow banks furnish a higher return than banks typically do, but their investments are much riskier and lack government protections for investors. Much of the mischief in the 2008 financial crisis was caused by shadow banks, whose combined assets were as large or perhaps larger than those of commercial banks. Five years later, shadow banks’ holdings represented nearly 80 percent of global gross domestic product. Nobody disputes this makes the global financial system less secure. Even those parts of the financial system that would seem to have nothing to do with you and me can disrupt our lives. I’d never even heard of “family offices” until I read Chuck Collins’s excellent 2021 book, The Wealth Hoarders: How Billionaires Pay Millions to Hide Trillions. (Clearly, I don’t hang with the right crowd.) Family offices are organizations set up by very rich people to preserve their wealth over multiple generations; they’re more or less Thomas Jefferson’s worst nightmare. Although family offices have been around a long time—the Cabots and the Lowells had them in the nineteenth century—more than half of those now in existence, per Collins, were created in this still-young century. Jeff Bezos’s dad just expanded his. Sometimes family offices combine into multifamily offices, or family funds. Vacationing in Nassau last year, I drove past what looked like a Walmart or Costco; on closer inspection, it was a big-box family fund. (It won’t surprise you to learn that family funds flourish in tax havens like the Bahamas.) Family offices and family funds are perhaps the most blatant engines of what Thomas Piketty calls “patrimonial capitalism.” That makes it tempting to greet the prospect that they might collapse with a hearty, “Good riddance!” And yes, if they declined in some gradual, stately manner like the Magnificent Ambersons, that’s what I’d say too. The trouble is that they’re at least equally likely to decline abruptly, taking the rest of us down with them. As The Economist observed in 2018, “Family offices could endanger the stability of the financial system. Combining very rich people, opacity, and markets can be very expensive.” When the family fund Archegos went bust in 2021, it cost Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley more than $10 billion, with ripple effects in the stock market of $33 billion. If your retirement fund held stock in CBS or Discovery then it was hard cheese for you. The corner of shadow banking that appears shakiest today is private equity, which is what we called leveraged buyouts before the convicted junk-bond king Michael Milken gave them a bad name in the late 1980s. Private equity firms use debt to buy existing firms; manage them to be more profitable, typically through layoffs; then take them public. Defenders of the practice used to say this made the target companies more efficient. But today almost everybody who doesn’t work in private equity hates private equity for loading up companies with insurmountable debt and raking in so much money on fees that private equity firms don’t have to care all that much whether this or that company survives. Another common criticism is that private equity puts the squeeze on certain enterprises—hospitals, retirement homes, even hospice providers—that were never intended to be profit-maximizers, weakening the quality of the vital social services they provide. Can’t afford to buy a house? In his latest book, Burned by Billionaires: How Concentrated Wealth and Power Are Ruining Our Lives and Planet, Collins demonstrates various ways in which private equity drives up housing costs. One Ohio firm invests in short-term and vacation rentals—Airbnb, Vrbo, etc.—to the tune of $1.5 billion, with capital from the Blackstone Group and other 800-pound gorillas in private equity. Lately I’ve had trouble reconciling two story lines in the financial press about private equity. One story line is that private equity is taking over the world. The other is that private equity is on the verge of extinction. Bethany McLean, the superb financial reporter who last week started a column in The Washington Post, squared the circle in her inaugural essay by explaining that private equity is swallowing up everything in sight precisely because it’s in financial trouble. McLean’s piece was about President Donald Trump’s executive order last month directing the Labor Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission to ease fiduciary requirements to encourage people to invest their 401(k)s in private equity and other “alternative assets,” by which Trump meant shadow banks. As it happens, Blackstone’s chief executive, Stephen Schwarzman, gave $37 million to Republican and conservative groups in the last election cycle. I’m sure that’s just a coincidence. Trying to herd grandma into private equity is insane. The rationale for private equity going unregulated is that the customers are either rich people or investors for giant pension and other funds who are savvy enough to take risks you and I shouldn’t, and rich enough that, should the risk go sour, no great harm is done. That’s the precise opposite circumstance from defined-contribution pensions, which until now have been regulated to the hilt to protect grandma from getting swindled. McLean doesn’t put it as bluntly as I do here, but her bottom line is that while you don’t particularly need private equity, “it is absolutely clear that private equity needs you—or rather, the trillions of dollars Americans have in our retirement accounts. Without our money, the industry is slamming into a brick wall of its own making.” I phoned McLean to ask her whether that brick wall is something that you and I need to worry about. Might private equity take us down with it? Absolutely, she replied. “Private equity has become too big to fail,” she said, “which raises a whole question of whether it should be private at all.” The solution, McLean said, is to regulate private equity as we do commercial banks and public corporations, with comparable transparency and legal limits on what it can do with our money. Private equity started to falter around the time Lina Khan became chair of the Federal Trade Commission, because any limit on mergers is a limit on how private equity firms reassemble the companies they acquire. Rising interest rates dealt another blow. Mostly, though, private equity was a victim of its own success. It ran out of things to buy and bid up the price of whatever was left. Default rates for private equity–backed companies, McLean pointed out, hit 17 percent during the previous three years, more than double the rate for companies not backed by private equity. By 2022, nearly half of all the supposedly slimmed-down and tuned-up companies exiting private equity firms were sold to other private equity firms, prompting one investor to tell The Financial Times, “This is the start of, potentially, I’m saying ‘potentially,’ a pyramid scheme.” In January, the FT columnist John Plender, writing about systemic risks in private equity, concluded: “No prizes for guessing where the next financial crisis will emerge from.” Of course, Trump doesn’t help matters by urging us all to throw our money into private equity and other risky shadow banks. But barring strict regulation of this sector to a degree that seems politically impossible at the moment, these outlaw financial institutions are fully capable of crashing the economy on their own.

Title: I've had an executive Costco membership for 10 years. It pays for itself — and then some.

Costco has always been a part of my life. I remember taking family trips to the warehouse as a kid and sharing soft-serve with my siblings. When I moved away for college, I still asked my parents to take me to Costco, often "borrowing" their membership card for big shopping trips to stock up on food and household items. Later, my partner and I went all in, splurging on our own executive membership and even getting the Costco Citi card. Now, as adults, we're at Costco multiple times each month, filling up on everything from gas to groceries. We make almost all our large purchases there, and have even booked Costco vacation packages. As a longtime shopper, I can confidently say the benefits of a Costco executive membership are worthwhile. Here's why I think it's worth upgrading to the higher membership tier. A standard Costco membership costs $65 a year, and the executive version is double the price at $130 annually. However, we recover the cost of the upgrade just by making qualifying purchases at the warehouse. That's because the executive membership comes with a 2% cash back reward, which allows shoppers to earn up to $1,250 back on qualifying pre-tax purchases. To break it down, this means that if we spend about $3,250 a year at Costco, we earn back the cost of the executive membership upgrade. If we spend a little more, we're making money to spend at the warehouse. Once a year — about two months before our membership renews — Costco sends a cash back voucher, which can be redeemed on future purchases. Plus, Costco has a membership satisfaction guarantee, meaning the company will refund the price of the membership at any time if you're not satisfied with it. In addition to the 2% cash back perk, Costco executive members can often access extra benefits. For example, the company recently started giving executive members a $10 monthly credit to use on same-day delivery through Instacart. The credit is automatically applied at checkout when we spend $150 (before tax). After returning home from vacation, this perk was a game changer. Instead of fighting the weekend Costco crowds to stock up on our favorite products, our groceries were delivered promptly to our doorstep. We were even able to snag a coveted rotisserie chicken. And speaking of vacations, executive members also get extra benefits on trips booked through Costco Travel. A few years ago, I purchased an all-inclusive vacation package to Costa Rica. As part of the deal, my friend and I each received $50 to use at the spa and a complimentary fruit basket for our room. Earlier this year, Costco announced it would be opening its doors for an additional six and a half hours each week for US executive members. Now, we can begin shopping at the warehouse an hour early on weekdays and Sundays. On Saturdays, we can enter half an hour earlier than other members. We recently attended this special shopping hour on a Sunday and noticed a stark difference. For example, my store typically has a line out the door to get in at opening, but we were able to stroll right in without bumping into anyone. We didn't even have to wait in line to check out. We'll likely make it a habit to go during these exclusive hours, as it made for a much better experience overall. I've been shopping at Costco for as long as I can remember, and I don't plan on stopping anytime soon. Costco's greatest draws are its ability to provide value for the price and an unbeatable customer experience. For my partner and me, paying for the executive membership is a no-brainer. The 2% cash back means our $130 annual membership pays for itself. Plus, we love having access to all the premium perks. Jump to
