Mr. Market falling out of bed due significantly to the Trump tariff whiplash has freed the business media to go with both barrels after Trump economic policies.

One is the lead item in the Wall Street Journal, Consumer Angst Is Striking All Income Levels. The story describes clearly how the rate of decline in confidence and spending accelerated in February as compared to January. And this is before Musk started threatening bulwarks of many Americans finances, Social Security and Medicare. Remember it isn’t just retirees who get whacked. Those within 10 to 15 years of retirement who expected Social Security to be a significant part of their retirement funding are likely to hunker down further on spending to try to bulk up their nest eggs. From a reader by e-mail: I am slated to start getting my SS in September after waiting until the end of the window. The promised amount will be a substantial part of my retirement income. Ditto for my better half who will retire at the end of June. It better be there. I have paid into the system with every paycheck since I was 15 years old in the summer of 1971. Those who made Bernie Sanders impossible, twice, made Donald Trump inevitable, twice. The opener from from the Journal’s account: American consumers have had a lot to fret about so far this year, between never-ending tariff headlines, stubborn inflation and most recently, fresh fears about a recession. These concerns seem to be hitting spending by both rich and poor, across necessities and luxuries, all at once. Take low-income consumers: At an interview at the Economic Club of Chicago in late February, Walmart Chief Executive Doug McMillon said “budget-pressured” customers are showing stressed behaviors: They are buying smaller pack sizes at the end of the month because their “money runs out before the month is gone.” McDonald’s said in its most recent earnings call that the fast-food industry has had a “sluggish start” to the year, in part because of weak demand from low-income consumers. Across the U.S. fast-food industry, sales to low-income guests were down by a double-digit percentage in the fourth quarter compared with a year earlier, according to McDonald’s. Things don’t look much better on the higher end. American consumers’ spending on the luxury market, which includes high-end department stores and online platforms, fell 9.3% in February from a year earlier, worse than the 5.9% decline in January, according to Citi’s analysis of its credit-card transactions data. Costco whose membership-fee-paying customer base skews higher-income, said last week that demand has shifted toward lower-cost proteins such as ground beef and poultry. Its members are still spending but are being “very choiceful” about where they spend, Chief Financial Officer Gary Millerchip said. He said consumers could become even pickier if they see more inflation from tariffs. The Journal helpfully provides charts that show that the big Biden deficits did not translate into fatter wages: Later in the Journal’s discussion: The economy has seen pockets of weakness in recent years, but nothing that suggests such widespread weakness…. Several years of inflation—particularly on necessities such as groceries, rents and utility bills—have hit poorer Americans hard. But a strong stock market, buoyed by artificial-intelligence hype, kept wealthier folks spending. Recall how we have repeatedly featured analyses by Tom Ferguson and Servaas Storm that showed how depending groaf has become on the outlays of the richest cohort, to the degree that it was a big factor in stoking inflation. The Journal later took up this thesis. But now: This week alone, consumers have had plenty of new developments to digest. President Trump on Sunday declined to rule out a U.S. recession as a result of his economic policies, causing stocks to plummet. This was followed by yet another roller coaster of tariff threats, counter-tariffs and reversals. While Wednesday’s inflation data showed price increases slowing down slightly in February, that is cold comfort because it is too early to reflect the effects of Trump’s tariffs… Many also have less cold hard cash on hand. Checking and savings deposit balances across all income levels have declined over the 12-month period through February and are getting closer to inflation-adjusted 2019 levels… What this means is that consumers generally are less able to absorb shocks, just as uncertainty is soaring. It is hard to blame them for turning cautious, even if that means the economy suffers. So shorter: Mr. Market and the Confidence Fairy were keeping the economy chugging along, even if it was not widely recognized as a two tier enterprise. Now Trump has managed to whack them both, hard. Remember, a surprising trend since the crisis is the degree to which even the moderately to very wealthy would borrow against assets. Falls in asset prices put a hard brake on that as an additional booster. A new Axios story, Voters disapprove of Trump’s economic policies, polls show, explains why the public view of Trump’s schemes has soured: The big picture: The ramifications of Trump’s policies are already rippling outwards and impacting businesses and communities. Our thought bubble, from Axios’ Ben Berkowitz: Investors are beginning to realize the first-term “Trump put” — the notion that he’d change policy if markets reacted negatively — isn’t in evidence this time around. Recall that the mother of all shock doctrines, Pinochet’s 1975-1975 program, which unlike the Trump program, did produce some initial promising results, eventually led to damage so severe as to lead Pinochet to go hard into reverse.1 As we have seen repeatedly (particular tariff threats, the Ukraine negotiations, Trump ritually beating up on Bibi before shoring him up, Iran) Trump seems to relish making radical reversals simply because he can. But how much ego investment does he have in his tariff and Federal institution destruction program? He’s rhapsodsized so much about how wonderful it was in the great pre-electricity, barely-any-indoor plumbing Gilded Era that one can expect him to be far less responsive than he has on his other pet project. I’d like to see we’ll see soon enough, but we may not. ______ 1 From ECONNED: Chile has been widely, and falsely, cited as a successful “free markets” experiment. Even though Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet’s aggressive implementation of reforms that were devised by followers of the Chicago School of Economics led to speculation and looting followed by a bust, it was touted in the United States as a triumph. Friedman claimed in 1982 that Pinochet “has supported a fully free-market economy as a matter of principle. Chile is an economic miracle.” The State Department deemed Chile to be “a casebook study in sound economic management.” Those assertions do not stand up to the most cursory examination. Even the temporary gains scored by Chile relied on heavy-handed government intervention…. The “Chicago boys,” a group of thirty Chileans who had become followers of Friedman as students at the University of Chicago, assumed control of most economic policy roles. In 1975, the finance minister announced the new program: opening of trade, deregulation, privatization, and deep cuts in public spending. The economy initially appeared to respond well to these changes as foreign money flowed in and inflation fell. But this seeming prosperity was largely a speculative bubble and an export boom. The newly liberalized economy went heavily into debt, with the funds going mainly to real estate, business acquisitions, and consumer spending rather than productive investment. Some state assets were sold at huge discounts to insiders. For instance, industrial combines, or grupos, acquired banks at a 40% discount to book value, and then used them to provide loans to the grupos to buy up manufacturers. In 1979, when the government set a currency peg too high, it set the stage for what Nobel Prize winner George Akerlof and Stanford’s Paul Romer call “looting” (we discuss this syndrome in chapter 7). Entrepreneurs, rather than taking risk in the normal fashion, by gambling on success, instead engage in bankruptcy fraud. They borrow against their companies and find ways to siphon funds to themselves and affiliates, either by overpaying themselves, extracting too much in dividends, or moving funds to related parties. The bubble worsened as banks gave low-interest-rate foreign currency loans, knowing full when the peso fell. But it permitted them to use the proceeds to seize more assets at preferential prices, thanks to artificially cheap borrowing and the eventual subsidy of default. And the export boom, the other engine of growth, was, contrary to stateside propaganda, not the result of “free market” reforms either. The Pinochet regime did not reverse the Allende land reforms and return farms to their former owners. Instead, it practiced what amounted to industrial policy and gave the farms to middle-class entrepreneurs, who built fruit and wine businesses that became successful exporters. The other major export was copper, which remained in government hands. And even in this growth period, the gains were concentrated among the wealthy. Unemployment rose to 16% and the distribution of income became more regressive. The Catholic Church’s soup kitchens became a vital stopgap. The bust came in late 1981. Banks, on the verge of collapse thanks to dodgy loans, cut lending. GDP contracted sharply in 1982 and 1983. Manufacturing output fell by 28% and unemployment rose to 20%. The neoliberal regime suddenly resorted to Keynesian backpedaling to quell violent protests. The state seized a majority of the banks and implemented tougher banking laws. Pinochet restored the minimum wage, the rights of unions to bargain, and launched a program to create 500,000 jobs. Just like they brand Health care act under Obama as Obamacare, they need to brand this economy on Trump and coin a word-Trumponics sounds good. People need to know and more importantly make the connection of their collapsing 401K to Trump. Actually, Obama initially hated the term “Obamacare”. He later embraced it when the Dem-friendly media took to touting how it had reduced the number of Americans without health insurance…omitting that many found Obamacare policies to be so skimpy and costly as to make it a coin toss as to whether to stump up for them or not. Very true, what a racket. It should have been called RomneyCare, but no matter, the so-called ACA was another gift for the insurance oligopoly and could be considered a form of kleptocracy. https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2015/10/23/451200436/mitt-romney-finally-takes-credit-for-obamacare Massachusetts still has a health insurance mandate with tax penalties for those who don’t have insurance. It has a religious objection exception which I have used every single year, to not pay the penalty. The form is entitled Healthcare Information and is pages long making it the majority of pages of the “simplified” tax form (epic political fail) and requires input of very long policy account numbers and company identification numbers and number of months carried. I just completed my LAST Massachusetts income tax form and mailed to Massachusetts dept of Revenue. On it, I circled the “Healthcare Information” title on the form and wrote at the side of the page “You call this a Healthcare form but all your questions pertain not to healthcare, but insurance. Insurance is not care, and healthcare insurance is not healthcare. You should remove this title from this form and stop deceiving taxpayers.” Equally bad, as Stoller has pointed out, Obamacare caused massive consolidation as insurers worked around the medical loss ratios by simply buying hospitals and physician practices en mass. Fun times! Obamacare has truly been a complete debacle. Not for the insurance oligopoly. It is a gift that keeps on giving! So-called health care in the USA is a giant extortion racket. A great example of Kleptocratic Oligarchy Trumponomics . . . Trumpinflation . . . yes, it would be good to repeat those words millions of times in millions of places to get them into the general public brainfield. Maybe cute little trolls could make ” I did that” stickers featuring Trump’s face instead of Biden’s face, and go around sticking millions of them onto millions of packages of eggs. If it achieves nothing else, it would create jobs in the sticker industry. Saw a video news clip of Trump a few days ago where he stated America was going to be rolling in money from all the income derived from tariffs, would not know what to do with it all – rim shot …. And there will be rainbows, unicorns and cotton candy for everyone! We can always believe the promises of politicians, con-men, and snake-oil salesmen. It’s an American tradition Here is the instant rimshot sound effect button its very own self, in case anyone wants to use it. Of mafia dons , Trump is more Madonna ( US) rather than Mogilevich ( grand don of world crime syndicates, Russia). Out of his depth all round? Trump 720 degress round and round we go, reminds me of a scene in Flawless 2008. Michael Caine plays London Diamond’s janitor being interrogated by the insurance investigator (Lambert Wilson) of entire diamond inventory gone missing as Demi Moore (the only female company Manager repeatedly passed over in promotion) looks on. Growing exasperated with the investigator’s endless minutia questions, Janitor asks investigator in English understatement: “You sound like someone who’s looking for something. Perhaps if you tell me what it is, I could help you find it.” Well that was quick. Trump only had his Inauguration Day about 7 weeks ago and he has already succeeded into steering the US economy towards a ditch with the press shouting ‘Woop! Woop! Terrain. Terrain. Pull up! Pull up!’ Makes you wonder what he will do for the next 200 or so weeks. Trump has certainly done tremendous damage and created a lot of uncertainty but there are a lot of signs that the wheels were starting to come off the economy in November, December, and January. Hiring was slowing and inflation was being way too persistent. Trump has now thrown his brand of chaos into the mix and nobody knows what is going to happen next. The stock market is at an inflection point and might come back really strong if he gets his tax cuts passed cleanly. If he doesn’t , look out below and it’s going to be an ugly ride. The economy was looking a bit wobbly in the fall, but it looked in much worse shape back in 2022, yet no recession occurred. And most of the “persistent inflation” has been the housing index, which for various reasons the U.S. measures in such a way that it’s a lagging indicator. My understanding is if we measured housing costs like the EU, inflation would have officially been like half a percent lower – much closer to the 2% target. Gosh! I feel so much better knowing that things are not so bad if only we measured housing costs like the EU. By the way, how is the EU doing these days? Hooray, more tax cuts for oligarchy! That will surely boost the economy. We agree with Matt L. In essence, the “wheels have fallen off” in the US. Today, Ben Norton on X said, it looks as though Trump might be seeking a Reagan re-do with “The Plaza Accord.” Big item on the list “devaluing the dollar.” Back in the 80s, other countries agreed with Reagan to follow suit, but today, nations/investors think very differently. Has that occurred because more countries/investors are buying into Gold rather than using T-bills. We’re shootin’ in the dark here. Perhaps Yves could explain if and why there might be a new Plaza Accord, or is it too late for the US to do that?? Most Americans living through the second Gilded Age don’t remember, but the first one was replete with violence. Labor actions and protests were met with armed strike breakers and corporate militia massacres. The Pinkerton Detective Agency targeted labor organizers and fought pitched battles with strikers. Workers and Anarchists responded with bombings and assassinations. It’s ironic that Trump idolizes President McKinley, who was president during the first Gilded Age, and the beginning of the American empire, while Trump presides over the second Gilded Age and final chapter of the American empire. McKinley was assassinated by an anarchist. And while history doesn’t repeat, perhaps it rhymes? “Managed recession”, a phrase heard Tuesday from a true believer, lol. I’m waiting for “managed industrial collapse” lol A boy can dream 🥲 It won’t be managed. Oh, they may well manage it…. ;-) Meanwhile, Mark Cuban (a democrat and Trump critic, I believe) prepares to feast on the carcass of government agencies destroyed by DOGE: Oligarchs will feast, and they’ll feast, and they’ll feast, feast, feast, feast! It’ll be the US’s Yeltsin era. I don’t think Russians or anybody else will feel much pity. Indeed, dual-nationality carpetbaggers from across the world will likely going be flying in to get a piece of the privatization action. How ironic would it be if the Chinese and Russians got in on the action? Pretty sure dual-nationality Americans would be flying out of the country at the same with their looted fortunes to places safe from lynch mobs. Zuckerburg already has that mansion with the bunkers waiting for him in Hawaii and Thiel has New Zealand citizenship after spending only 12 days in the country- https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/29/new-zealand-gave-peter-thiel-citizenship-after-spending-just-12-days-there Its all good in Hawaii until they decide to eat the zukes ala Cook. Did you ever have the Tall Poppy Syndrome in Aussie? It seemed really pronounced in NZ when I traveled there quite a bit in the 80’s. Thiel would be one mighty tall Poppy. Hawaii is not out of the country. Hawaii is a U.S. State. Maybe unhappy Hawaiians could start building and putting up huge official-looking signs: . . . ” Welcome to Hawaii! America’s Baltic State.” Well, the lege is looking to make Independence Day (Nov 28) a state holiday (SB 614). Ua Mau ke Ea o ka ʻĀina i ka Pono Eggs. That foodstuff so symbolic in so many ways. Besides the economy, which I’ll muse about, Easter is coming up. Eggs at Easter are a thoroughly nonbiblical sign of lavishness, fertility, and renewal (along with bunnies, in the US of A). On BookFace after the election, a number of liberals were posting memes along the lines of, “Hah, the MAGAts sold their civil rights for a dozen eggs!” One immediately notices just how out of touch liberals are. No wonder the Democrats can’t win and can’t operate as an opposition. The egg represents several things that are now being pointed up in U.S. culture. Notice the guy at the refrigerator in the TwiXt? Here in Italy (and as I recall, in France), eggs are not refrigerated. The refrigeration is a clue that there is a problem in the U.S. food distribution system, one more foodstuff that is being abused. Recall the salmonella outbreaks. Recall that USonions can’t get a caesar salad with its traditional ingredient: a raw egg. I am not a big consumer of eggs: I use them to make savory tarts, quick breads, and cakes. But many of our fellow commenters mention that they eat the traditional U.S. breakfast: two eggs, sunny-side up. Italian eggs come in fourpacks and sixpacks. In the U.S., if you are going to eat the traditional breakfast, you’ll require a dozen. Price becomes a political issue. The U.S. Constitution indicates that the federal government is supposed to encourage manufactures and trade and productivity. One wonders what is coming apart in the pursuit of happiness. Hence: Eggs as a sign of deterioration in one’s standard of living, in the quality of food, and in availability of basics (like a doctor’s appointment). An egg shortage? In the land of amber waves of grain and fruited plains? It’s a symptom that I keep monitoring. Just as I monitored prices in Chicago in September 2024, when I went to a nice (but not fancy-shmancy) café that I once frequented only to find that an espresso coffee and plain croissant had risen to USD 9.18 $. That’s when I knew that Kamala Harris would lose. Eggs? Trump had better keep his eye on the egg. The reason eggs in the US are refrigerated is our bizarre production system. Eggs are somehow washed to remove a thin membrane….which keeps them from going bad faster! So in places with sensible practice, like Italy, Australia, and Southeast Asia, eggs in stores are not refrigerated and are good for about 3 weeks. Farmer & homesteader tip: if you don’t wash your eggs, they keep in the fridge for a couple months! However my hens produce so many my fridge would fill up entirely if I didn’t distribute them. When the collapsenik neighbor gives you free eggs during eggflation, you are more amenable to his crazy ideas… I am winning hearts and minds out here you wouldn’t believe And I think they’re good for longer too, if someone regularly flips them, or if waxed, or if coated in butter. Filthy US industrial agricultural practices, which also includes mistreatment of the animals, is the reason US eggs get washed, raw chicken carcasses are washed in bleach, dairy has to be pasteurized, and all the warnings about thorough cooking. Caged chickens lay eggs and poop in the same tiny confined place. Potatoes also last much long if they are NOT washed. In Mexican supermarkets, eggs are sold by the dozen, not refrigerated, but in smaller shops and the public markets they are sold by weight, again, unrefrigerated, and you can buy as many or few as you need. They are not inexpensive, and are at least as popular for breakfast as they are in Canada. Shells are very fragile and thin — and they taste better! I don’t know how to post a link here (and am a little wary of breaking the rules), but BIG by Matt Stoller has posted an amazing piece of the global control of the egg industry: Fowl Play: How Chicken Genetics Barons Created the Egg Crisis: https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/fowl-play-how-chicken-genetics-barons?utm_campaign=email-half-post&r=15fy5x&utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email That’s a great article for understanding what is/has happened to the egg industry fairly recently. I had never heard of egg barons before and having only two giant companies (not USA based) controlling the vast majority of egg/chicken production through sketchy genetic engineering practices was a revelation. Here on Oahu, Hawaii, most of our eggs come from California. There was a period of 3-4 weeks where they were pretty much unavailable but lately I see no shortage. Local Hawaii eggs are about $4 a dozen more expensive than mainland eggs typically. In 2016 I was lucky enough to visit Kauai. At the time the island was being overrun by feral chickens; we were told this was because there were no mongooses unlike there were on other Hawaii islands. Maybe the crafty little so and sos are better at hiding their eggs too. Easter egg hunt anyone? Maybe all year round. Eggs, rent and gasoline, all are easily cited as markers of runaway inflation forcing prices higher and many citizens of America to adapt into a less than optimal ( or sub-optimal, to quote CNBC anchor Jim Cramer ) spending and consumption for an overall healthy economy. At the very least, my latest rent renewal had a modest price increase, so the monthly rent is not increasing at the same pace from prior years. I’ll take a win where I can find it. Headlines a few weeks back were discussing if or how Disney might adjust or review their pricing packages for their park guests. These problems met the new administration when they walked in the door. And as referenced above it won’t be long until those ubiquitous stickers on gas pumps are perhaps showing up on egg cartons with a face switched out. Just as a general point, in parliamentary democracies on a 4-5 year cycle of elections, the notion of ‘getting the cuts in’ first is quite common – almost standard procedure. While actually engineering a domestic recession is unusual (although not unknown), its standard practice to dampen economic expectations for the first 2 years or so in the hope/expectation that there will be a later upswing – most politicians are well aware that most people don’t vote on the basis of absolute economic conditions, but on expectations – i.e. if people feel ‘things are getting better’ they will be more likely to stick to an incumbent, hence its rare for a government to lose out during an upswing (even if they were responsible for the ‘dip’ – people have short memories). This is probably what UK Labour is trying to do, albeit incompetently. This generally doesn’t happen in the US system because of the non-synchronous cycle of elections. But if you have a President who doesn’t really care about the mid terms, then this approach can make a certain amount of sense, especially if he is seeking rapid structural change. It doesn’t have to be a Pinochet type ideologically change – it may just be a calculation that there is a lot of deadwood and bubble in the system, and better to flush it out quickly, then use the following upswing to build in whatever new economic system you want. I suspect that Trump doesn’t really want a tariff based tax system, its just a short term way for him to shock the international trade system into the form he wants – i.e. one in which there is US onshoring and the US industry (not Wall Street) calls the shots. Also, worth pointing out that Isabella Kaminski is speculating that a recession is part of an implied deal with the tech oligarchs – an initial cutting down to size in favour of a longer term accommodation – exactly what we’ve seen in Russia and China. I don’t particularly agree with this, but it is an idea worth holding in mind. Some tech oligarchs seem to think this is what they’ll be getting: “Industrial Greatness Requires Economic Depressions” from Palladium, a Thiel mouthpiece. Thanks for the link. Some real doozies in there – I think everyone here will have a laugh at the assumptions. E.g. “While comparing GDP across centuries is necessarily a shoddy and incomplete affair due to poor data and the limitations of the concept of “GDP,” it is nevertheless a useful starting point. In 2021, the Medicaid program alone spent $7,593 per enrollee, or about $9,000 in 2024 dollars. This one social program provides the poor with roughly the entire income of an average Gilded Age American, to say nothing of the plethora of other social services and transfer payments which America is wealthy enough to afford today.” Who comes up with this stuff? As if “the poor” ever see a dollar of this money. People still don’t fathom that the rich, such as Thiel and Musk, don’t want more- they want it all. They think if we all live in Grafton, New Hampshire it will be a good thing. this is a deeply fascinating link. i’ve felt for a while that musk, thiel, and co are going to use the trump admin to sieze power, but i was expecting something a little more obvious, like government contracts suddenly switching from boeing to spacex. this article agrees with that, but implies that the trump admin is first purging their enemies via forced economic depression. purge then replace could be the overall strategy. but i dont know how good the implementation is going to be. the us would be in a very vunerable place during the transition time, and there could be consequences to that. ie, climate catastrophe coming in, and there being too much chaos to effectively deal with it. also. the article makes the big assumption that optimizing for innovation is a good thing. which, i am sure is true for some people. but plenty of people want to optimize for stability. what your values are determines what world you consider to be better. so like, eh. as a mere mortal i feel uncomfortable claiming what the ultimate best thing to optimize for is. instability is definitely good if you’re looking to seize power tho. “The US has no functioning democracy… an oligarchy with unlimited political bribery” When oligarchs openly call the shots, and free speech is legally equated with $$, how can one speak of “democracy” with a straight face? How obvious does it have to get? I think the outline of their idea is firming up. It is not an internal recession but an external one they seek. Seeing that the world is drifting away from the US they seek to transmit through the consumption channel a shock that will enable the US to regain a bit of its comparative advantage that it is losing. Ideas of re-industrialising the US will take decades and necessarily start with the technical education system which has dwindled away. These people have no patience and will not personally gain from such actions so seek to force overseas winners into the US in a manner they can personally profit from. First must come a change to budget making so that finances come before the spending not the other way around, otherwise deficits will continue. National infrastructure spending is the usual spur to industrial strength. And of course the ever present danger of GFC 2 requiring a $ 10 trillion dollar bailout with these valuations and extent of speculative activity. I think Trump and Bessent aren’t really afraid of an early recession (yet). It seems like Bessent may think the best way to draw down interest rates is a good ol’ recession. If you look at the amount of maturing government debt in the next 1-2 years, it’s a bit scary, and they may want to refi with better rates. Even though Reagan didn’t really “engineer” a recession, his administration suffered a bad one in 81-82, but by 84, it was “morning in America”. Hi PK. I suspect this is what Trump’s team is attempting. And you are right that usually in a 4-year political cycle it’s a very risky strategy. But I think they’re willing to run the risk. I can also cite two previous Administrations, both Republican, who did the same with success: Nixon and Reagan. Nixon was a political loner and didn’t care about his party in Congress, which were a distinct minority in 1969-70 anyway. Nixon as President basically made a deal with the Democrats who led Congress: I’ll sign your domestic agenda into law, you give me free reign and your support in foreign affairs. (That’s how we got the EPA, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, etc., etc., etc.). I don’t recall offhand what happened in the 1970 midterms but the result wouldn’t have made much difference to Nixon’s presidency. Reagan certainly cared about his party in Congress, but like Nixon, they were far from a majority, although they did have a great deal of political organization and energy. Hindsight tells us that Reagan did have a knack for getting what he wanted out of the Democrats in Congress. On the economy, he had Nixon’s example from the previous decade, and a lot of Nixon’s key people (e.g. George Schultz) around him who knew just how to do it. They did it so smoothly that their timing was perfect for the “recovery” scenario you outlined in Reagan’s re-election campaign. I was in my teens at the time, but I do recall public perceptions about the economy shifting in early 1983. This strategy has become one Republican template. They don’t all use it, but as a party, it’s in their culture and some of them have learned how and when to try it. Trump is not only a businessman with a natural feel for big economic trends, he’s basically a lame duck. This compromises his political leverage somewhat, but in other ways gives him more range and freedom of action, not having any electoral consequences of his own to fear. Trump is following in the other non consecutive terms footsteps, in that the Panic of 1893 got going just before Grover Cleveland was inaugurated, and the years 1893, 1894 and 1895 are the rarest for US silver coins-as not many were minted on account of lack of demand in commerce when money was mostly silver. We’re gonna get there by other means to be determined, by our determined teetotalitarian leader. And a lot of the post election spending and maybe some of the debt accumulated, was perhaps from Americans who anticipated the tarrifs and were buying before those went into effect. Anecdote is not data, but several friends and relatives bought large ticket items just in case. Cars, cell phones, etc. I can confirm, anecdotally. that my sister is planning her spending on large ticket items and goods stockpiling in anticipation of the negative impacts of tariffs. As bad as the ‘70s economy was supposed to be there was never a shortage of eggs being flung at windows now and then. I still see some finance types saying that the master plan to manage the deficit is on track (lower rates, weaker dollar, and another goal that I forget) but even if true, the mid terms have to be at risk. Wait until the Trump promised elimination of taxes on tips and social security are “deferred” to a later bill while the Trump tax cuts are extended (I’ve seen early whispers about this). Just saw an email from my congress critter asking for constituents affected by federal cuts to contact his office. Signs of life in the Democratic party! I have been assuming that the midterm risk will be managed by not having free and fair elections. The SAVE act, armed thugs at polling places, etc. When squillionaires choose and fund the candidates, they don’t need to prevent the unwashed masses from voting. US elections are already neither free nor fair. Fighting Aliens in Aliens II: “What the hell are we supposed to use man? Harsh language?” Response of “constituents affected by federal cuts” … “Harsh language”? I believe that is what your congress critter might apply to counter Trump’s efforts toward economic collapse. I always assume the goal is fund raising. Thank you for this extremely convenient round up, Yves. I wondered if this might finally lead to a much needed separation of business and state, similar to separation of church and state. It would be nice, but I’m not getting my hopes up. An Amendment that establishes that money is in no way speech and that corporations are not people with any inherent rights would be a game changer. Amendment not required, and politicians who say otherwise are just trying to construct political cover. The spending=speech doctrine stands only absent any legislative or executive action. Faced with a strong enough challenge from either or both of the other two branches, the judiciary is checked. But they don’t even have to be checked if the legislature acts decisively on its own. Neither party in Congress has any intention of challenging the notion that spending=speech. It works to their distinct material advantage, so they prefer to make people think their hands are tied. They are not. The passage of an Act of Congress nullifying cases like Buckley and Citizen’s United would probably be enough by itself to overturn those decisions. And if the President were to sign it into law? The judiciary’s natural inclination is to defer to the legislative power, especially when joined in common cause with the executive. In other words, those Supreme Court decisions are only still relevant because of a policy vacuum which both parties in Congress help to maintain as beneficial to their own selfish interests.

Tankus summarizes: “The pattern across my previous reporting, my current reporting, the reporting of others and this late-breaking FBI-EPA-Citibank situation suggest that the Trump administration is testing the waters in order to gain far greater control of the United States entire payments infrastructure- control great enough to bend Donald Trump and Elon Musk’s enemies to their will at a speed far faster than courts could ever conceivably contain.

Title: Can Costco Stock Sink 30%?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team , Contributor. COST Stock Note: Costco FY’24 concluded on September 1, 2024. In an ever-changing retail environment, Costco’s (NASDAQ: COST) has become a symbol of stability and success, fueled by its unwavering commitment to revenue growth and customer satisfaction. The warehouse giant’s stock was up 5% year-to-date, until very recently, outperforming the S&P 500 which was down 2%. Now, in the past week, COST stock has lost over 10%, while the S&P lost 3.8%. Year-to-date the stock is still ahead, dropping 2.5% vs. a 6% drop for the index. However, the stock is acting weak, as of mid-day on Thursday, March 13, and is down a further 3.6% today, with the S&P sliding 1.3%. Despite increasing living costs, Costco’s value-driven approach has resonated with consumers, as shown by its 9% year-over-year sales growth in January 2025, outpacing the U.S. retail sector’s 4% sales growth. Separately, see What’s Going On With Abercrombie & Fitch Stock? But Here’s the Catch: Even Costco is not immune to economic downturns. In 2022, its stock price dropped by as much as 30% over just a few quarters, highlighting its sensitivity to market fluctuations. This historical trend raises concerns that Costco’s current share price of around $940 could potentially fall to $650 if similar conditions occur again. However, for investors seeking less volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High-Quality portfolio provides an alternative, having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Once again, although Costco is promising significant developments with its plans for international expansion, broader product offerings, and exclusive membership rewards, a greater risk to the U.S. economy must be taken into account. Costco’s business model relies heavily on international trade, with roughly one-third of its U.S. sales coming from imported products. Importantly, the company’s exposure is diversified, with fewer than 20% of its imports coming from China, Mexico, and Canada. The proposed 25% tariff on Canadian and Mexican imports poses a significant risk, potentially increasing grocery prices and causing shortages of essential items in the U.S. Additionally, tariffs on Chinese imports might also raise the prices of electronics and furniture sold at Costco. Although inflation concerns have somewhat eased, they still persist. Trump’s aggressive policies on tariffs and immigration have revived worries about a potential return of inflation. This uncertainty, combined with the U.S. economy’s susceptibility to a downturn, raises the possibility of a recession. See our analysis here on the macro picture. Furthermore, the global geopolitical environment has become increasingly unstable, characterized by the ongoing Ukraine-Russia conflict, escalating trade tensions, and strained relationships with traditional allies such as Canada, Mexico, and Europe. These factors present significant risks, underscoring the importance of closely monitoring the macroeconomic outlook. COST stock has been more resilient than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some recent downturns. While investors remain hopeful for a soft landing for the U.S. economy, how severe could a future recession be? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash illustrates how key stocks performed during and after the last six market crashes. • COST stock dropped 30.6% from a high of $600.04 on 8 April 2022 to $416.43 on 20 May 2022, compared to a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 7 December 2023 • Since then, the stock has risen to a high of $1,076.86 on 13 February 2025 and is currently trading at around $940 • COST stock declined 13.6% from a high of $324.08 on 20 February 2020 to $279.85 on 12 March 2020, compared to a peak-to-trough drop of 33.9% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully rebounded to its pre-Crisis peak by 9 July 2020 • COST stock dropped 48.5% from a high of $74.66 on 8 July 2008 to $38.44 In summary, it does not help that Costco’s stock remains expensive. Its current valuation of 58 times last year’s earnings seems overextended, far exceeding the pre-pandemic price-to-earnings range of 25 to 30. Moreover, Costco’s Revenue growth has decelerated, with FY 2024 recording the slowest growth in seven years. Thus, while many appreciate Costco for its low prices and convenient services, ask yourself: will you hold your Costco stock now, or will you panic and sell if it begins to decline to $800, $700, or even lower? Holding onto a falling stock is never simple.

Title: Is Bob Chapek Running Southwest Airlines?!

Time Published: 2025-03-11T21:09:31Z

Umbrella Bob strikes back! In a move that can best be described as “Chapekian,” the Walt Disney World fan-favorite airline is changing everything that made Southwest, Southwest. This article details the huge changes to the budget carrier that will fundamentally alter allegiances with family travelers for decades to come. To be clear, the title is sarcasm. Questioning whether Bob Chapek had suddenly been promoted to CEO of Southwest Airlines is what first crossed my mind when hearing this news. I also may or may not have looked up SWA’s Board of Directors to see if ole Bobby Boy had snuck into a high-level leadership position. Chapek is unaffiliated with Southwest Airlines…for now. Perhaps he’s waiting for a call from Spirit. That does seem more his speed. As it turns out, Southwest Airline’s CEO is Bob Jordan, who also serves as President and Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors. Bob is a 36-year Southwest veteran, who has held 15 different positions in the company. Bob Jordan, as with Bob Chapek before him, proves that decades-long veterans of a company can somehow manage to misunderstand the foundation of fandoms and brand loyalty. At minimum, both demonstrate a lack of concern about alienating the people who make up the respective companies’ core customers and risking what leaders before them built-up over decades. Must be a “Bob Thing.” Here’s a rundown of the changes according to Southwest Airlines, which obviously is trying to spin these in the best light possible: In a nutshell, Southwest is ending its “bags fly free” program and charging all but business travelers and high-status customers for checked bags. Southwest is also reducing the points most customers earn on flights on the one hand, and devaluing its points upon redemption on the other hand. Southwest is also introducing a basic economy fare that could, in theory, be cheaper than its current fares. Equally likely, it will result in nickel & diming a la Frontier and Spirit that hits consumers with hidden fees and upcharges after the lower upfront booking. These changes come ahead of the rollout of assigned seating and premium legroom categories, which were previously announced. Southwest Airline’s changes come after months of pressure from activist investor Elliott Management. The firm took a stake in the airline last year and won five board seats as it pushed for major changes at the company, which clung to perks like free checked bags, no change fees, and open seating. “Two bags fly free” is a registered trademark of Southwest Airlines. Its about-face on what executives long cast as a sacrosanct passenger perk comes as something of a surprise. United’s CEO likened Southwest ending its flyer-friendly baggage policies to the “slaying of a sacred cow.” At the same time, it’s not surprising that investors would want a slice of that “fee pie.” Other airlines generated more than $5 billion from bag fees last year, according to federal data. Southwest executives have long said they would not charge for bags, telling Wall Street it’s a major reason why customers chose the airline. (Like Costco and cheap hot dogs!) Just last fall, Southwest doubled-down on this position at its investor day, stating it had down rigorous research that such a policy would cost the company $300 million. Although Southwest said that it would gain between $1 billion and $1.5 billion from charging for bags, the company indicated it would lose $1.8 billion of market share over time. Southwest said at the time that its ‘bags fly free’ policy generates market share gains in excess of potential lost revenue from baggage fees. In “fairness,” Southwest’s stock was up 8% on the day (an otherwise down one for the broader markets) after announcing these changes. That suggests Wall Street strongly endorses the moves as being good for business. Of course, it’s fair to point out that what’s good for investors in the short term is often at odds with what’s good for companies in the long term. This is especially true for companies that have spent decades building up fan loyalty and brand goodwill. We’ve had an article or two ’round these parts about the dangers of chasing quarterly results at the expense of inflicting reputational damage. (I’m not a fan of this approach, to put it mildly.) Turning to commentary, the title wasn’t a joke. Well, it was to the extent that I didn’t actually believe Bob Chapek had secretly become CEO of Southwest Airlines. But I’m completely sincere that this strikes me as a very Chapekian move, analogous to what happened to Walt Disney World a few years ago. Bob Chapek is not running Southwest, but it’s the same type of short-term gains mentality that’s ruining Southwest. In both cases, those calling the shots seem to fundamentally misunderstand the appeal of their products. In Southwest’s case, the company has revealed a dramatic turnaround plan, that (spoiler alert) mostly copies the business plans of legacy carriers like Delta, United, and American. During presentation to investors late last year, Southwest Airlines executives laid out plans for assigned seating, extra-legroom seats for purchase, a redesigned cabin, and other behind-the-scenes initiatives designed to increase revenue and turn around an underperforming stock price. Fast-forward to today, and Southwest is ditching its unique playbook of more than 50 years that had developed it a loyal fan following in favor of an airline that largely resembles most of its peers. Now, Southwest is dropping its famous “bags fly free” slogan as part of a massive push for the carrier to end long-standing customer perks and policies. Sound familiar? It’s not that much different than Walt Disney World making a variety of business decisions and justifying them on the basis of what’s “standard industry practice.” Both companies have seemingly forgotten what makes them standouts in their respective travel classes, voluntarily ditching their distinct advantages to be more like everyone else. Unicorns who’d rather be among a herd of horses. We’ve often pointed out that despite Walt Disney World being a resort business that also operates theme parks, Disney actually is not that good of a hotelier. We’ve further argued that it made little sense for Disney to chase Marriott, Hilton, and Hyatt–that Disney is better off differentiating itself and competing on its own terms (themed design, perks, etc.)–that Disney cannot compete on the terms of real world hotel brands. This is because even most mid-tier chained-brand hotels handily beat Disney on operations. When it comes to the luxury properties (JW Marriott, Park Hyatt, Conrad, etc), there’s absolutely no competition. All of those brands handily trounce even the best Deluxe Resorts. Hence Disney being better off competing on its own terms and differentiating its product offerings to minimize comparisons, as opposed to inviting them. It’s the same story with Southwest versus the legacy carriers. The competitive advantage that Southwest had was its loyalty among its fans and families as being the convenient and friendly airline that offered perks and less friction. Southwest has built generational goodwill on the basis of its intangibles. Even though it was technically a budget airline, Southwest has, over time, inched up into the pricing territory occupied by Delta, United, and AA. Despite that, it was still preferred by some travelers because it offered a distinct advantage via attitude, perks, and a traveler-friendly ethos. In voluntarily giving that up for some reason, Southwest is going to invite freer comparison–and comparison shopping on price–via consumers. Travelers will try Delta, United, and American as a result. That should be worrying for Southwest because, frankly, it cannot compete with those airlines on the overall experience. Those airlines offer premium cabins, lounges, international destinations & alliances, reward partners, and–most importantly–have invested significantly in their terminal and in-flight experiences in recent years. Southwest has none of that. I have some degree of sympathy towards Bob (Jordan, not Chapek). He and other Southwest executives have fought a hard fight against activist investors, even as the airline has endured struggles. They tried to retain the ‘secret sauce’ that made Southwest, Southwest, but ultimately had to give in. Part of this is happening no doubt because Wall Street is seeing the success that other domestic airlines are having in catering upmarket towards business and luxury travelers. That’s been a growth engine for Delta and United, and those legacy carriers have increased their premium product offerings to improve their businesses. Investors are salivating at that, and want the same for Southwest. Not to stereotype or paint with too broad of a brush, but I would hazard a guess most Wall Street types have never flown Southwest. They don’t seem to grasp what it is–or rather, what it is not. Bluntly, Southwest is not an airline catering to business or luxury travelers. They are upending their business to chase a market that does not exist. In the process, once families and leisure travelers who were loyal to Southwest have tasted the proverbial steak (and not even filet, since the U.S. legacy carriers aren’t that good compared to their international counterparts) of Delta or United, they aren’t going back to the hamburger helper that is SWA. I say this as someone who used to fly Southwest exclusively and still does from time-to-time. Every time I fly SWA, I remember why Delta is my favorite airline. In terms of the Disney trip planning angle, that’s it. Don’t be a creature of habit and continue to fly Southwest if there’s no compelling reason for you to remain loyal. Vote with your wallet and feet, and jump to a different carrier. The ‘best’ airline for you will vary based on your home airport, but consider giving others a shot. For us, flying between Southern California and Orlando–or LAX to international destinations–Delta is far and away the best U.S. carrier. It’s not even a remotely close call. Your mileage may vary, quite literally in this case. The timing of this move by Southwest also strikes me as really odd. To Bob Chapek’s credit (words I hate typing), at least his approach to degrading the Walt Disney World guest experience was well-timed. It was done during a tumultuous time that offered Disney the cloak of the phased reopening as an excuse to reset the guest experience–and consumer expectations. It’s obvious to us that was a convenient excuse, but more importantly, it was opportune timing. Disney under Chapek acted aggressively once it realized revenge travel was going to be a thing, and capitalized on pent-up demand and reduced consumer expectations to raise prices while cutting corners and removing perks. People kept packing the parks, regardless, because they were making up for lost time and traveling again. Once it became clear that pent-up demand was running its course (some other things also happened), Disney seized the opportunity for another reset. It axed Chapek and brought back the Beloved Bob (Iger) to make popular decisions and be the fan savior for a bit, before becoming the villian. That’s the CliffNotes version, but the point is that Walt Disney World’s trajectory has been to improve the guest experience, fix things, and pull various “levers” to win over former fans and consumers–and that’s an arc that began over 2 years ago! Southwest seems to have missed the memo that pent-up demand is over, and is speedrunning Walt Disney World’s misguided decisions from ~4 years ago. At least back then, the decisions–however misguided–could be leveraged for a short-term bump before a “hero” came back to restore the company to its former glory. Instead, Southwest Airlines is doing this at a time when consumer confidence is cratering, markets are down, and a recession is looming. On the exact same day that SWA made this massive move, several other major airlines cut their earnings forecasts due to soft demand and economic uncertainty. Southwest is also making this foundational paradigm shift while in a fundamentally different position from Walt Disney World. Regardless of how disappointed fans have been by dubious decisions of the Chapek regime, Walt Disney World still offered a compelling product and held unparalleled position as the market leader. Although Universal and other parks are competitors, there is no true substitute good for Walt Disney World. It would take a lot of truly terrible decisions to make Disney comparable to Six Flags (not for lack of effort). By contrast, Southwest has put itself in a position where it now does have direct competitors and, as noted above, it’s inviting unfavorable comparison. Southwest is now on par with Delta, United, and American in terms of pricing…but not the overall quality of the experience. Experience-wise, Southwest is arguably positioning itself to be like Frontier and Spirit…but without the attractive pricing that causes travelers to overlook those airlines’ faults. This no man’s land that SWA is seeking to occupy makes the circumstances here completely different from Walt Disney World a few years ago, making this move all the more confounding.

Another long-time Southwest loyalist here – flew them anytime I was paying for the ticket myself (unless flying overseas) and many times when someone else was. While I’m not a big flyer (usually 2-3 trips per year on WN) and I doubt they care about my business much, in the past, I never even shopped other airlines because I had points through the Southwest credit card and knew they weren’t going to jerk me around with things like expiring flight credits and change fees. Between this, paying for seats, and reduced checked baggage (I’d still get one per person since I have the credit card) they’ve really damaged their value proposition – and like you pointed out, who *will* choose them when they are just another airline…but with older planes and crummy gates and the same prices? I live in Colorado and United and Southwest are the main nonstops out of Denver. I price these two against each other a lot, and after Southwest announces they’re moving to assigned seating, I got a United card. There are more perks, including one free checked bag. I’ll still price compare but Southwest’s prices have gone up a lot since a few years ago and they’re no longer my go to. I had to cancel a flight with them recently and thankfully those credits won’t expire. I’ll look to use them in the next year and maybe move on to comparing the other carriers. “In voluntarily giving that up for some reason, Southwest is going to invite freer comparison–and comparison shopping on price–via consumers. Travelers will try Delta, United, and American as a result. That should be worrying for Southwest because, frankly, it cannot compete with those airlines on the overall experience. Those airlines offer premium cabins, lounges, international destinations & alliances, reward partners, and–most importantly–have invested significantly in their terminal and in-flight experiences in recent years. Southwest has none of that.” THIS. My husband has an American card for when he’s traveling for work, when we are traveling without our daughter and want more of a luxurious experience, and when it’s inevitable that we will need a connecting flight so we can use the lounge at O’Hare. I have a Southwest card for the Companion pass, the free checked bags, and frankly, because they always have nonstop flights from Indianapolis to Orlando. Without the free checked bags, and assuming that I now will not earn enough points to maintain the Companion Pass, I have almost no reason to keep this card and drive two hours from Fort Wayne to Indy just to fly Southwest. I told my husband that I am canceling this card after our March/April trip and getting a card with Delta instead. We’ll have to deal with connecting flights, but at least we won’t have to drive to Indy anymore, and we’ll have two options with great lounges for our layovers. So, thanks Southwest? I’ll probably still fly SW some because they have a lot of direct flights from my home airport, but I will be checking other options now. I used to not bother doing that–because the simplicity of their website, not worrying about getting nickel and dimed on picking out a seat, and the ease of rebooking if my plans changed, made any slight difference in price worth it. I booked my kids’ college Christmas break flights with ease knowing if his dates changed, odds are I could change the flight without getting penalized (which happened once his finals schedule was nailed down and I ended up with a credit). I ignored other carrier options because they are more complicated and I realized that by the time I actually completed booking, their total cost would be the same or more than SW. I now have an incentive to avoid SW (a) because I’m annoyed and (b) why pay the same or more without easy rebooking/credits to fly a bargain experience airline? I might as well try Delta My problem also becomes that SWA will start to cancel routes, and even the rare non-stops. There are 10 flights a day right now out of TPA to the city I fly to for family visits. Great article, Tom! Thanks for getting the message out there and how it relates to what Disney just went through. I fly Southwest because I know the price I book at is the price I’ll pay – end of story. I don’t even check anything else because it’s too much of a hassle/extra math. If I now have to start doing the math of bag fees, etc. every time I want to price out flights – then I now have no reason NOT to check sites like kayak & what not to see if I’m actually paying a good rate or not or if there’s a direct flight or better layover via another airline. Basically – they had me as a captive audience for all my flying and now don’t – I think that math they did on bag fees being less than the bookings they’ll loose to other companies is spot on. I read the email from SWA today and thought the exact same thing as your article outlines! What are they THINKING? Or perhaps, just NOT thinking enough about long term customer erosion. Their prices have been creeping up and they are already more expensive than most carriers out of the 2 major airports near us. I had a TERRIBLE experience on my most recent flight as well. After my final miles are burned, which will be easy with their new deflation plan, I will cancel my RR credit card and be done. That’s pretty sad because for many years, they were my go to airline. And we travel with carry on luggage, so it wasn’t about the lack of fees for checked baggage. SWA just felt a little more homey and caring and maybe even fun, if that’s possible for an airline. I’ve already been cutting back on flying because the money I save flying vs. driving is more than offset by the increasing costs to rent a car once I arrive at the destination airport. I’ll drive more often now, especially since for reasons relating to aging I can’t get by on less than 2 bags. Depending upon a person’s vacation plans, YMMV, of course. Hi Brother, I like what you wrote here and tend to agree with you. In general. The flip side of the coin is that the Ash Heap of American business history is full of once iconic and dominating brands that failed to Keep Up With The Joneses. (Sears at one point had TWO-thirds of the American populace shopping there.) Will history record these decisions by Southwest as the Fait Accompli that eventually killed the company? Maybe. But it is waaayyy too early to make a salient argument that these decisions will hurt or destroy Southwest in the long-term. They just might be what keeps it going another 50 years. Over dinner our family was talking about the changes as Southwest. My 23 year old said, “Dad, I’ve never flown on another airline.” All of this feels like loosing a longtime friend over something stupid. I sent an email to Southwest and shared the story of my son and reminded the airline that “loyalty goes two ways”, if you want my loyalty, you need to be loyal to me. With the Southwest difference obliterated, I feel I’m free to roam the county on other airlines. I’ve contact Chase to inquire about cancelling my Southwest credit card and will be exploring other travel cards. I saw a post on BlueSky that announced Southwest’s newest fare: “Wanna Stay Home”. Yep, I’m feeling that right now. As both a lifelong Disney and SWA fan and loyal customer, I’m unhappy about the changes to both companies over the last five years. But the reality of a public company in the golden age of “the cult of shareholder value” is that activist investors, be they Nelson Peltz or Elliott Management, will relentlessly agitate for bottom-line impacting changes. No company management is safe from this pressure (except Berkshire of course). We’re a society that worships at a cross of gold, and what’s happened at Disney and SWA is a direct reflection of that. All we can do in response is vote with our wallets, which means forgoing experiences which historically brought great joy. It’s a conundrum that makes me both angry and sad, tbh. We have very limited options when it comes to flying direct from Pittsburgh to MCO, but you can bet I will be exploring all options now, including driving. I had always tried to book with SW first for their perks, but if they are going to nickel and dime us like everyone else, then the lowest price will win. Very disappointed in Southwest. I’ve been pretty loyal to Southwest over the years- earning companion pass and a boatload of points through their personal and business cards is part of what allows my family to continue to be out of state annual passholders. They’re also only one of two carriers to offer direct flights to Orlando from my home airport (JetBlue being the other), and Southwest almost always has the better flight times. The devaluation of points and losing free cancellations at the lower tiers are really the announcements that are killing me. I already have a companion pass through the end of 2026 (and I fully expect by 2027 it won’t be so easy to earn the CP) and likely we’ll keep flying until our very significant amount of points run out, but after that, chances are JetBlue will become our go-to and I’ll work on hacking my way to a ton of points with them instead.

Title: How Target put a target on its own back

Target was the cool place to shop. Now it's everyone's favorite target. There are few activities more delightful than getting a little wine drunk and hitting up the local Target to go treasure hunting. Sure, you pretend you're there for a legitimate reason — to pick up toilet paper or trash bags. But whatever the plan was going in, you wind up with a basket full of random goodies: a bikini for a vacation you're not taking and party favors for a gathering you're not having. A yoga mat! Hot Cheetos! Five packs of gum! At Target, the world is your oyster in terms of stocking up on stuff you absolutely do not need. Even if you're doing Target sober, you wind up drunk on stuff. But lately, that Target trip has been a little less joyful, if you're even going at all. The Minneapolis-based retailer has been going through a rough patch as price-conscious consumers cut down on just-for-funsies buys that fuel Target's sales. And in terms of politics, it seems like Target can't get anything right. For the past two years, it's found itself at the center of America's culture wars, drawing the ire of conservatives and progressives alike. For some consumers, popping into Target (or refusing to) has turned into a political statement, though it's not clear what statement it even makes. Target can't decide what it stands for, ideologically. For many businesses, that's fine, but in Target's case, cultural relevancy is baked into the business model, and it keeps waffling on how it wants to be relevant. What Target stands for economically isn't working right now, either — it's operating from a place of weakness. The result: a Target that can't keep a, well, target off its back. If you want to get a sense of how things have been going for Target lately, just take a look at its stock price. Target shares are down by more than 30% over the past year and by over 50% since their 2021 peak. While its most recent quarterly earnings were generally in line with Wall Street's expectations, it hasn't reported strong financial results since the pandemic. The retailer also said sales were off in February because of the weather and "declining consumer confidence," and it has anticipated tariff-related price increases in a matter of days. Things are not working in Target's favor, in part, because it relies on discretionary spending — basically, the nonessentials. As people pull back on that kind of spending amid inflation and worries about the economy, that hits Target where it hurts. "People expect prices to rise, and that's causing people to spend more conservatively, and that's causing them to think twice about throwing this or that other thing into their cart," said Zak Stambor, a senior retail and e-commerce analyst at EMARKETER. "Target's business relies on people throwing this or that into their cart." (EMARKETER is owned by Axel Springer, the parent company of Business Insider.) Target is struggling to differentiate itself and compete against Walmart, Amazon, and Costco, said Michael Baker, a managing director and senior research analyst at D.A. Davidson. If a consumer's focus is product selection and wowing customers with compelling offers, Costco's the answer (or at least as good as Target). If it's convenience, it's Amazon. If it's price, Walmart wins. "That doesn't mean that Target can't find their niche," Baker said, but the niche it does have — wants and not needs — is one that doesn't work great in this environment. "With the wind at their back and people spending a lot on discretionary items, we think Target can compete reasonably well, but in a more difficult environment, the increased competition over the past decade or so, I think, makes it that much more difficult for them," he said. Target is also struggling to catch up in some booming areas that are working for its competitors, like groceries and e-commerce. Both efforts have been undertaken "halfheartedly," said Zhihan Ma, a senior research analyst at Bernstein. Target largely relies on its stores to fulfill online orders, which may be cheaper in terms of the up-front cost to implement, but it's very labor intensive, as associates are expected to deal with in-person shoppers and e-commerce customers in tandem. Beyond the slow-walked investments, one of the key differentiators for Target — a relatively enjoyable shopping experience — has been undercut in recent years. Target's attempts to fight retail theft mean more merchandise winds up locked up. Like with other retailers, some locations have problems with inventory shortages or crowded aisles. The result is a shopping experience that isn't a bang-up time, which is especially damaging for Target, where a bit of fun is part of the point. "The business is what the business is to a large extent," Stambor said. "Target is a place to find that cool other thing that you didn't expect to throw into your cart." While Target has been having a tough time financially over the past couple of years, it may be even worse when it comes to the news. Yes, there are some positive headlines about Stanley's "Wicked"-themed cups and everything it's doing with Taylor Swift. But there are a lot more negative headlines Target would rather not see. One of the ways Target has sought to differentiate itself from competitors is by embracing a rather cosmopolitan identity. It does collaborations and deals with designers, big-name brands, and celebrities. It tries to get higher-end consumers in the door. It's a bit fancy — there's a reason people use a little French accent to call it "Tar-jay." That means some of its consumers, particularly those who are more progressive leaning, expect more from it, and in some cases, Target has been happy to oblige. "In some ways, they're victims of their own success," Baker said. "Target has come to stand for fashion and fun and it is really a very culturally relevant retailer," he said, which puts it more in the crosshairs than Walmart and Amazon. As recently as 2020, Target was leaning into this identity. The Minneapolis-based retailer had positioned itself as a leader on racial justice in response to George Floyd's murder by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020. The moves seemed to go over well until 2023, when it stumbled into a series of culture-war woes. That year, many businesses faced a backlash after a Bud Light marketing campaign featuring the transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney sparked outrage among some consumers in the spring. Heading into the summer, Target's Pride month collection — something it's been doing for years — became the subject of right-ring focus. Some of the hullabaloo was completely made up, such as false social media reports that Target was selling "tuck-friendly" bathing suits for children. But the dust-up also moved from social media to the real world: Some angry shoppers were actually attacking associates and destroying store displays. Target scaled back its Pride collection, moving items to the back of the store in some locations and pulling some items altogether. It later said the backlash hurt sales. Since then, Target's been stuck in a loop of corporate identity indecision that it seems unable to get out of. The decision to scale back on Pride made no one happy — some consumers were already upset about the merchandise's existence in the first place, and others were upset because Target backed down. Target declined to comment for this story, but with regard to its diversity strategy and business outlook, a spokesperson pointed to links to its "Belonging at the Bullseye Strategy" and its fourth-quarter results. Target has taken a similar please-no-one approach when it comes to its diversity, equity, and inclusion policies. In January, the company said it was axing multiple DEI initiatives, including ending its three-year DEI goals, wrapping up a program to invest in Black-owned businesses, and stopping participation in external diversity-focused surveys. Target's DEI efforts and reversals have been met by resistance on several fronts. On the right, the retailer has been hit by a lawsuit brought by the state of Florida, among others, saying investors weren't made aware of the risks of Target's DEI initiatives and potential backlash. On the left, the Atlanta pastor Jamal Bryant has called for a 40-day boycott of Target over its DEI rollback. "Any time a company is visible, it's a target for activists who have one agenda or another," said Brayden King, a management professor at Northwestern. At a moment when much of corporate America is anxious about the political environment, Target, in particular, seems to be bearing the brunt of all these swirling emotions. Many people feel powerless when it comes to actual politics, so pouring their frustrations into things they can control — where and how they shop — turns into an outlet for some sort of action. The big issue, however, isn't that Target sold Pride merchandise or undertook DEI initiatives, it's that it so openly waffled on all of it. Again, it's similar to Bud Light: The near-ubiquitous beer brand did a tiny marketing campaign with a transgender influencer, and when that caught fire online among right-wing personalities, the company panicked and backed down instead of keeping calm and staying the course. When a company capitulates to backlash and cowers, it suggests what it initially did was incorrect — and ultimately pleases nobody. Wavering draws more attention to the issue. It signifies weakness — which, in the case of Target's business, is part of the problem. It also degrades trust with consumers and turns the company into a more obvious target for activists down the line. "That kind of seesawing back and forth and saying one thing and doing another, that's what gets brands like Target in trouble," said David Albert, the chief insights officer at Collage Group, a consumer research firm that focuses on multicultural audiences. "We've seen here, especially with Target, is that they've eroded that trust because they're not doing what they say and they don't say what they do." It's not clear how much the political noise will impact Target's bottom line. The 2023 Pride backlash did ding sales, but that was a temporary problem. As a general rule, the vast majority of boycotts don't work. Consumers are set in their ways and often prioritize convenience. If there's a Target down the street or a Walmart 30 minutes away, most people will stick with Target. Also, if you really start to worry about whether each and every business you interact with aligns exactly with your values, you will likely find there is nowhere on Earth you can shop. "Boycotts, of course, are very effective tactics for drawing attention to a cause," King said. "It will have this effect of making Target look bad. But do I think that it will affect what Target does? Probably not." Just because boycotts rarely work doesn't mean they never work. Bud Light, for one, really did see a decline in sales. The evidence is mixed on whether February's single-day "economic blackout" was effective, but there are at least some signs it may have moved the needle. Ma, from Bernstein, said it's too early to tell if the DEI-related backlash will hurt Target's long-term financials, but she acknowledged that it may introduce more "volatility" into its shorter-term results if it continues to find itself embroiled in cultural backlashes. "It doesn't help, for sure," she said. In terms of the business basics, Target has plans to get back some of that Tarjay sheen. It's amping up its private-label offering, creating more in-house brands that resonate with consumers and give them a reason to go to Target, specifically, rather than somewhere else. It's seeking out more flashy collaborations and partnerships, like with Warby Parker. It's scaling Target Plus, its third-party marketplace. It's still hoping consumers will do a spin around the store for those glorious little splurge buys on top of the basics. Still, in the retail landscape, Target isn't in a highly enviable position. Between price-sensitive consumers and tariff whiplash, the macroeconomic landscape is not stacked in its favor. And its soft business outlook means that in terms of the culture war, it's operating from a place of weakness, which raises the chances of making a misstep. Instead of companies worrying they're going to be the next Bud Light, they're likely starting to worry they'll be the next Target.
