If you want to be happy or happier, the best way to do it is to purchase accumulate and acquire bitcoin, like taking your economic happiness and energy, and putting it into an infallible bitcoin. So assuming that you’re living in Mexico City, Thailand, Vietnam Cambodia Laos, off the grid, and you love being off the grid, not being tied down by anything… Bitcoin is the ultimate freedom energy economic power property you can own. For example, I think one critical mistake a lot of millennials make is they want to buy some sort of like weird off-roading Mercedes sprinter van, and they essentially like a homeless people in RV parks? So for myself, I’ve always had a passion for nontraditional idea paths etc. To be contrarian means to just go against the herd. So for example, even though I’m a huge fan of Tesla and Elon Musk, am I the only successful millennial person individual, super rich who would actually prefer having a Toyota Prius or maybe now, the Lexus TX car? I think there’s a lot of press about you being able to camp and live in a cyber truck, and I think it’s a great idea, but, I find it actually much more practical to get like maybe a Lexus TX Plugin hybrid car, the ultimate luxury SUV minivan, and just sleep and live in the trunk of that? The side is once again, the plug-in hybrid concept is still the most best double leverage thing you can get; the side of gasoline, which power is like 90% of humanity, and also, electricity, the Hybrid engine, as well as the plug-in capability. Something that people don’t really talk about is that the upside of having a hybrid car is that when you idle, most often times it is silent. This is phenomenally fantastic if you’re taking a nap in the car with your kid! No solo gasoline car is worth it; either hybrid, plug-in hybrid or nothing. ￼ Once again, even today… We are still stuck in this slave like mentality of vehicle ownership. I suppose the good thing about having an old Prius is that it never feels like a liability. If somebody steals it, hit it I could care less. Also pro tip, if you have peeling paint or something on your car, just order some 3M matte black vinyl vehicle wrap online, cut it yourself and just stick it on like a sticker! Looks very cool. Another funny trend, everyone in LA wants to murder at their cars in all black, but, this is a positively bad idea because Los Angeles is essentially a desert with lots of dirt particles in the air, the ideal car color is either white or some sort of desert tan color; any color which does not show dirt. And also a lot of these fools don’t understand is that if you have a black vehicle, you’re going to get cooked alive in the summertime! The funny thing is actually… When I was a kid growing up, nobody wanted to own a black car. A sports car was universally red; everyone wanted the red Integra type R, with the gloss white rims. I could care less about your four bitcoin Ferrari, or your two bitcoin Lamborghini. Or your one bitcoin cyber truck. What is super interesting and fasting about bitcoin is that it is almost like wealth on wheels. And only that but it is like the ultimate type of wealth and property you could actually own. Why? It is like perpetually in your mind in your head and your soul; and it is not physical, yet it is real and exists. A lot of people don’t understand what this point is, they think that it is fake money. But no, bitcoin is digital cyber capital, which is 1 trillion times more profound as an idea. Why? If you could teleport a skyscraper into cyberspace, make it immortal, immutable, indefinitely divisible, with no property tax, no mayor trying to put regulations on you, no death in decay, no annoying tenants etc.… You essentially have perfected digital and cyber capital And property. ￼ Traditionally, in the past, you only purchased real estate not for the utility purposes, but rather, as a long-term store value and or maybe income generation? The difficult thing is at best, you have to skillfully manage your real estate and property, get good tenants, collect the rent, but still you might have to deal with Insurance, things breaking, changing zoning laws in your local city or area, etc. I think this is a hard thing for a lot of people to understand is that you cannot tax bitcoin, only if you sell it. But if you never intend to sell it, you will never actually incur a capital gains tax, and even greater… The amazing thing about bitcoin is that assuming that it is digital property, you don’t have to pay Property taxes for simply holding it and owning it. Let us say you buy a $2 million home in all cash, but still… Even with a nominal 1 to 1.25 or 1.5% property tax, you’re going to be paying like 2000, $2500, maybe even $3000 a month in property taxes, simply for owning the thing. And you’re going to have to pay that forever. ￼ This is kind of a scary thing… And it seems a little bit weird and unethical; if you own a piece of land, why do you need to pay taxes simply for the right of owning it? Like for example if I own a gold bar, in this gold bar is my property, I don’t have to pay 1% ￼tax on it, simply for owning it, forever? Even in some ways, maybe we consider inflation like an indirect tax on you. For example if you have like $1 million of cash just sitting in a checking account, the reason why this is bad is because it is draining economic energy like 15% a year. For example you’re $1 million worth of cash is going to degrade to like 750,000 the first year, $500,000 the next year, $250,000 the next year, down to $125k the next year etc. kind of a really bad situation. Volatility is energy power and vitality and vigor. Volatility is power! So for example, a nuclear reactor is very very volatile, but it is perhaps maybe one of the best blessings for humankind, because if managed in handled properly, it’s like free electricity and power for everyone forever. Bitcoin is like nuclear economic energy and power. Maybe people are afraid of bitcoin like they are afraid of nuclear power plants. Certainly we do not want a Fukushima,,, but still, certainly in the early adoption years of electricity, I’m sure that there are some people who accidentally electrified themselves to death. ￼ Also, I am also very certain in the early days of fire, there must have been some caveman who were burned to death. Or even the early water wheel, I’m sure there are some people who accidentally got crushed to death by it. But we do not ban these things simply because there were a handful of people who died from it. If you think about Satoshi like being Prometheus, who brought fire to the masses, isn’t this like the greatest blessing of all time? It seems that Michael Saylor and the like talk about Satoshi with some sort of extremely deep reverence. Even I was shocked. Also what becomes very interesting about bitcoin in general is that it definitely is starting to become like religious at this perspective. Like even beyond a cult. Religion. The immaculate conception of bitcoin, Satoshi, giving this gift to humanity, and essentially disappearing forever. Anybody who claims to be Satoshi, ignore them, they certainly are not. Why? Because 1, million bitcoins is essentially like worth what, $200 billion or something, essentially in the next upcoming months and years you’re going to see Satoshi becoming even richer than Elon Musk. And I’m very certain that within the next 5 to 10 years, you’re going to see Michael Saylor maybe being at least 2 to 3 times richer Than even Elon Musk. ￼ Anyways if you have that much energy power in wealth and bitcoins, you are not going to want to have anybody know who you are because realistically your life will probably be in peril. Very simple thing… He has literally almost like tripled my net worth in the matter of three months? There is no other human being on the planet who has ever directly or indirectly did this for me? And the reason why this is such a big deal is once again, now, as a consequence, the cost of living in LA becomes like a joke, really kind of not a big deal, I feel comfortable having 2, 3, 4 or even five kids. ￼￼ Another mistake that people make is that the point of becoming super rich is not to suddenly go out and buy a bunch of silly things. The purpose of the point is instead, to rather, live a more carefree life, less stress less anxieties less annoyance. Dropping $500 on beef ribs at Costco is just like a drop in the bucket. At this point the only money I spend on myself is my weightlifting equipment, my beef ribs, and maybe some new Vibram five fingers when my shoes fall apart. But besides this, I have like no use for money. And once again, the goal is to build in stack capital, we all live in capitalism, not “moneyism”. ERIC KIM CAPITAL a good ring to it. or ERIC KIM KAPITAL Ironically enough it is once again not really about consumerism, if you were a real capitalist, your joy is more in senior capital stack, not seeing it becoming depleted because you bought some sort of loser Ferrari or Porsche. I’m still shocked; 95% of water in America, we are simply being baited along by having some sort of allure of some sort of luxury vehicle but isn’t ideal to be like a digital nomad, traveling to Japan and Kyoto, visiting the Hot Springs, or living this luxurious Expat life in Cambodia Vietnam or Thailand? For example, my friend Todd Hata did it well, he sold his old house in the mountains in LA, and is essentially like on the road 90% of the year, jumping between Mexico City, Thailand, Greece etc. His passion has always been travel, and food and experiences, very wise. Even if you’re the average American, most people cannot afford to purchase physical property. And once again, if you do the math, after homeowners insurance, Tax, fire taxes, ￼ stuff breaking, having to change the roof, getting a new washer and dryer or dishwasher, upgrading your kitchen, you’re going to bleed yourself dry. And not only that but I think being a homeowner becomes a new consumerist things; spent too much time thinking about how to break down walls to extend your home, build an ADU, update the kitchen whatever. Or expanding your garden, changing the flooring etc. But don’t you realize that the best thing to do is just be in nature? Or just drive to the Huntington Gardens on the weekend, or just travel to Japan instead? In fact when you go on a flight, and you see all these little tiny homes From Birds Eye view, you realize how ridiculous the desire of homeownership is. I think real estate will be the next sector that bitcoin gobbles up. The average GenZ person doesn’t care for buying a house, they want to just play pickle ball, go hiking and camping, go on road trips, buy the newest iPhone etc. Pursue their hobbies and passions. Millennials, we are a funny basket case. We used to be like GenZ, wanting to travel to planet, become a digital nomad, etc.… But somewhere along the line, maybe because of Covid, we tried to settle down and buy single-family homes instead? Or condos? I’m starting to feel like this is the early the Internet, AOL, AOL 3.0, you got mail, dial up 56K modems etc. I also like bitcoin because it is just easier to mentally and mathematically remember things. Easier to remember how many bitcoins you have on the top of your head, rather than trying to tabulate all the ones and zeros of all your fake fiat based assets? Rather than thinking about your net worth, easier to just remember your net bitcoins; ￼ Whenever I find out that somebody else is into bitcoin, I have zero issues asking them how many bitcoins they own. Why? Because it is still a relatively new field, it is awkward to ask people how much US dollars they have in their savings account, or checking account, Easier to just ask the bitcoin question. And for me, even owning a single bitcoin is like for me, owning like a square block of digital Manhattan or Kyoto. You know these rich families that own huge plots of land in desirable locations? Yeah, that’s like bitcoin. A single-family home in Beverly Hills is what like at least 5 million, 10 million, 25 million, 50 million? 100,000,000? My personal projection is if you tag the price of a bitcoin to desirable real estate in the Brentwood Hills or something, just think about what the land is worth for the Getty museum. Or like owning a piece of land or property next to the PCH in Malibu. But actually if you think about it, the value of a single bitcoin is worth 1 trillion times more than even the best property in Malibu. Why? The dangers of owning physical property, landslides, Robberies, general maintenance. The fear that your housekeeper is stealing your stuff. For example, how comfortable are you leaving your $200,000 Rolex just sitting around? Probably not very comfortable. Bitcoin is the new family jewels. Take all of your scarce desirable assets like your Rolexes, your Leica, your Porsche and just buy bitcoin instead. Because once again , to have any sort of physical property in the physical realm is a liability not an asset. I’m starting to feel more bullish, increasing my target price of bitcoin to at least $55 million a coin. Probably higher. So if that’s the case, if you took a $10,000 Rolex, and sold it, assuming that bitcoin is around $95,000 of bitcoin right now, even lower at 89,000 of bitcoin or even $85,000 of bitcoin, whatever it may… Is massive upside. 611x The $6 million Rolex? Once again, so many of these things are just liabilities. I hate the fear of having to remember where I left it, and whether it is safe, whether it was stolen or not or whatever. Rather than putting your scarce desirable things into a physical vault, isn’t it far safer for it to be in a cyber Vault, on the Blockchain? What is the Blockchain,? It is like the cloud on steroids, with 1000 X more security power and cryptographic security. It took a long time for people to trust putting files on the cloud, or photos on the cloud, but now it seems like the obvious decision. I think the reason why I like Coinbase is that rather than having to memorize some keys in my head and have a hardware physical wallet, and knowing myself I am quite forgetful, you don’t want to lose like $1 billion worth of bitcoin because you forgot your password. I think this is also where this is a huge opportunity for Apple; if we have all of our bitcoin passwords and keys linked to our iCloud account, certainly we will never stop purchasing Apple devices. Even bigger, if Apple makes their own bitcoin ecosystem to custody your bitcoin in your Apple ID wallet, This could actually disrupt the whole Coinbase market. Let us consider that most of us have Apple Pay already enabled, how easy would it be to just buy bitcoin directly from your iPhone using Apple Pay? And it could be simple, you could just buy 10 bucks here, 20 bucks here, 50 bucks here, 100 bucks here etc. I don’t have an Apple credit card or bank account, but this seems like a good idea. I hate the weekends because the markets are closed. I would prefer a world in which my micro strategy stock could trade 24 7, 365, every day all day every day, on binance fidelity or something else. Apparently in 1933, the way that the traditional stock market was structured was actually to legitimately create a cartel. This is like the almost the exact opposite of American values of freedom, self sovereignty and freedom. Michael Saylor had a very interesting idea; why can you not own Apple stock directly on your Apple iPhone? There is nothing unethical about it. And technologically, we live in the year 2024 of course could be physically possible. Even the stock market is mostly driven by robots, you no longer have guys on the slips of paper. It ain’t like the Wolf of Wall Street. It’s like the wolf of cyber Wall Street.￼ Even here in Culver City, kind of like peak LA, there are so many businesses which are getting shut down like even me and Seneca’s beloved shake shack, and even more shockingly today, chipotle. If these trusted namebrand businesses are struggling in going out of business because we cannot afford to pay the rent or whatever… Isn’t this pretty bad? And also, physical entropy. Once again, if you want a physical house, shit will always break and you’re going to have to be liable for it. If you have an amazing landlord who always fixes everything super fast, even put in brand new appliances for you, leverage and milk that forever. Even we told our landlord that our washer washing machine had a little bit of rust in it, immediately sent in his team and installed a totally brand new Samsung washer and dryer , which might have caused like $5000 $6000? Even another thing that was interesting, there were some palm trees which were growing on top of the roof, and he just sent in a team to get it all cut down and fixed up? Even we had some issues with our electricity and water and water heater, once again he snapped his fingers and got it all resolved in a day or two, while me and Seneca having a fun adventure at the park. For myself, my core competency is within writing thinking blogging vlogging etc. ￼ from an economic perspective it kind of makes no sense for me to waste my time having to manage a home and fix things. I would rather manage thoughts ideas, big visions?

I think this is also where this is a huge opportunity for Apple; if we have all of our bitcoin passwords and keys linked to our iCloud account, certainly we will never stop purchasing Apple devices. Even bigger, if Apple makes their own bitcoin ecosystem to custody your bitcoin in your Apple ID wallet, This could actually disrupt the whole Coinbase market. Let us consider that most of us have Apple Pay already enabled, how easy would it be to just buy bitcoin directly from your iPhone using Apple Pay? And it could be simple, you could just buy 10 bucks here, 20 bucks here, 50 bucks here, 100 bucks here etc. I don’t have an Apple credit card or bank account, but this seems like a good idea. I hate the weekends because the markets are closed. I would prefer a world in which my micro strategy stock could trade 24 7, 365, every day all day every day, on binance fidelity or something else. Apparently in 1933, the way that the traditional stock market was structured was actually to legitimately create a cartel. This is like the almost the exact opposite of American values of freedom, self sovereignty and freedom. Michael Saylor had a very interesting idea; why can you not own Apple stock directly on your Apple iPhone? There is nothing unethical about it. And technologically, we live in the year 2024 of course could be physically possible. Even the stock market is mostly driven by robots, you no longer have guys on the slips of paper. It ain’t like the Wolf of Wall Street. It’s like the wolf of cyber Wall Street.￼ Even here in Culver City, kind of like peak LA, there are so many businesses which are getting shut down like even me and Seneca’s beloved shake shack, and even more shockingly today, chipotle.

Happy Bitcoin! Audio Happiness is forever, if in a Bitcoin! — Do you want to be happy or happier, the best way to do it is to purchase accumulate and acquire bitcoin, like taking your economic happiness and energy, and putting it into an infallible bitcoin. So assuming that you’re living in Mexico City, Thailand, Vietnam Cambodia Laos, off the grid, and you love being off the grid, not being tied down by anything… Bitcoin is the ultimate freedom energy economic power property you can own. For example, I think one critical mistake a lot of millennials make is they want to buy some sort of like weird off-roading Mercedes sprinter van, and they essentially like a homeless people in RV parks? So for myself, I’ve always had a passion for nontraditional idea paths etc. To be contrarian means to just go against the herd. So for example, even though I’m a huge fan of Tesla and Elon Musk, am I the only successful millennial person individual, super rich who would actually prefer having a Toyota Prius or maybe now, the Lexus TX car? I think there’s a lot of press about you being able to camp and live in a cyber truck, and I think it’s a great idea, but, I find it actually much more practical to get like maybe a Lexus TX Plugin hybrid car, the ultimate luxury SUV minivan, and just sleep and live in the trunk of that? The side is once again, the plug-in hybrid concept is still the most best double leverage thing you can get; the side of gasoline, which power is like 90% of humanity, and also, electricity, the Hybrid engine, as well as the plug-in capability. Something that people don’t really talk about is that the upside of having a hybrid car is that when you idle, most often times it is silent. This is phenomenally fantastic if you’re taking a nap in the car with your kid! No solo gasoline car is worth it; either hybrid, plug-in hybrid or nothing. ￼ Once again, even today… We are still stuck in this slave like mentality of vehicle ownership. I suppose the good thing about having an old Prius is that it never feels like a liability. If somebody steals it, hit it I could care less. Also pro tip, if you have peeling paint or something on your car, just order some 3M matte black vinyl vehicle wrap online, cut it yourself and just stick it on like a sticker! Looks very cool. Another funny trend, everyone in LA wants to murder at their cars in all black, but, this is a positively bad idea because Los Angeles is essentially a desert with lots of dirt particles in the air, the ideal car color is either white or some sort of desert tan color; any color which does not show dirt. And also a lot of these fools don’t understand is that if you have a black vehicle, you’re going to get cooked alive in the summertime! The funny thing is actually… When I was a kid growing up, nobody wanted to own a black car. A sports car was universally red; everyone wanted the red Integra type R, with the gloss white rims. I could care less about your four bitcoin Ferrari, or your two bitcoin Lamborghini. Or your one bitcoin cyber truck. What is super interesting and fasting about bitcoin is that it is almost like wealth on wheels. And only that but it is like the ultimate type of wealth and property you could actually own. Why? It is like perpetually in your mind in your head and your soul; and it is not physical, yet it is real and exists. A lot of people don’t understand what this point is, they think that it is fake money. But no, bitcoin is digital cyber capital, which is 1 trillion times more profound as an idea. Why? If you could teleport a skyscraper into cyberspace, make it immortal, immutable, indefinitely divisible, with no property tax, no mayor trying to put regulations on you, no death in decay, no annoying tenants etc.… You essentially have perfected digital and cyber capital And property. ￼ Traditionally, in the past, you only purchased real estate not for the utility purposes, but rather, as a long-term store value and or maybe income generation? The difficult thing is at best, you have to skillfully manage your real estate and property, get good tenants, collect the rent, but still you might have to deal with Insurance, things breaking, changing zoning laws in your local city or area, etc. I think this is a hard thing for a lot of people to understand is that you cannot tax bitcoin, only if you sell it. But if you never intend to sell it, you will never actually incur a capital gains tax, and even greater… The amazing thing about bitcoin is that assuming that it is digital property, you don’t have to pay Property taxes for simply holding it and owning it. Let us say you buy a $2 million home in all cash, but still… Even with a nominal 1 to 1.25 or 1.5% property tax, you’re going to be paying like 2000, $2500, maybe even $3000 a month in property taxes, simply for owning the thing. And you’re going to have to pay that forever. ￼ This is kind of a scary thing… And it seems a little bit weird and unethical; if you own a piece of land, why do you need to pay taxes simply for the right of owning it? Like for example if I own a gold bar, in this gold bar is my property, I don’t have to pay 1% ￼tax on it, simply for owning it, forever? Even in some ways, maybe we consider inflation like an indirect tax on you. For example if you have like $1 million of cash just sitting in a checking account, the reason why this is bad is because it is draining economic energy like 15% a year. For example you’re $1 million worth of cash is going to degrade to like 750,000 the first year, $500,000 the next year, $250,000 the next year, down to $125k the next year etc. kind of a really bad situation. Volatility is energy power and vitality and vigor. Volatility is power! So for example, a nuclear reactor is very very volatile, but it is perhaps maybe one of the best blessings for humankind, because if managed in handled properly, it’s like free electricity and power for everyone forever. Bitcoin is like nuclear economic energy and power. Maybe people are afraid of bitcoin like they are afraid of nuclear power plants. Certainly we do not want a Fukushima,,, but still, certainly in the early adoption years of electricity, I’m sure that there are some people who accidentally electrified themselves to death. ￼ Also, I am also very certain in the early days of fire, there must have been some caveman who were burned to death. Or even the early water wheel, I’m sure there are some people who accidentally got crushed to death by it. But we do not ban these things simply because there were a handful of people who died from it. If you think about Satoshi like being Prometheus, who brought fire to the masses, isn’t this like the greatest blessing of all time? It seems that Michael Saylor and the like talk about Satoshi with some sort of extremely deep reverence. Even I was shocked. Also what becomes very interesting about bitcoin in general is that it definitely is starting to become like religious at this perspective. Like even beyond a cult. Religion. The immaculate conception of bitcoin, Satoshi, giving this gift to humanity, and essentially disappearing forever. Anybody who claims to be Satoshi, ignore them, they certainly are not. Why? Because 1, million bitcoins is essentially like worth what, $200 billion or something, essentially in the next upcoming months and years you’re going to see Satoshi becoming even richer than Elon Musk. And I’m very certain that within the next 5 to 10 years, you’re going to see Michael Saylor maybe being at least 2 to 3 times richer Than even Elon Musk. ￼ Anyways if you have that much energy power in wealth and bitcoins, you are not going to want to have anybody know who you are because realistically your life will probably be in peril. Very simple thing… He has literally almost like tripled my net worth in the matter of three months? There is no other human being on the planet who has ever directly or indirectly did this for me? And the reason why this is such a big deal is once again, now, as a consequence, the cost of living in LA becomes like a joke, really kind of not a big deal, I feel comfortable having 2, 3, 4 or even five kids. ￼￼ Another mistake that people make is that the point of becoming super rich is not to suddenly go out and buy a bunch of silly things. The purpose of the point is instead, to rather, live a more carefree life, less stress less anxieties less annoyance. Dropping $500 on beef ribs at Costco is just like a drop in the bucket. At this point the only money I spend on myself is my weightlifting equipment, my beef ribs, and maybe some new Vibram five fingers when my shoes fall apart. But besides this, I have like no use for money. And once again, the goal is to build in stack capital, we all live in capitalism, not “moneyism”. ERIC KIM CAPITAL a good ring to it. or ERIC KIM KAPITAL Ironically enough it is once again not really about consumerism, if you were a real capitalist, your joy is more in senior capital stack, not seeing it becoming depleted because you bought some sort of loser Ferrari or Porsche. I’m still shocked; 95% of water in America, we are simply being baited along by having some sort of allure of some sort of luxury vehicle but isn’t ideal to be like a digital nomad, traveling to Japan and Kyoto, visiting the Hot Springs, or living this luxurious Expat life in Cambodia Vietnam or Thailand? For example, my friend Todd Hata did it well, he sold his old house in the mountains in LA, and is essentially like on the road 90% of the year, jumping between Mexico City, Thailand, Greece etc. His passion has always been travel, and food and experiences, very wise. Even if you’re the average American, most people cannot afford to purchase physical property. And once again, if you do the math, after homeowners insurance, Tax, fire taxes, ￼ stuff breaking, having to change the roof, getting a new washer and dryer or dishwasher, upgrading your kitchen, you’re going to bleed yourself dry. And not only that but I think being a homeowner becomes a new consumerist things; spent too much time thinking about how to break down walls to extend your home, build an ADU, update the kitchen whatever. Or expanding your garden, changing the flooring etc. But don’t you realize that the best thing to do is just be in nature? Or just drive to the Huntington Gardens on the weekend, or just travel to Japan instead? In fact when you go on a flight, and you see all these little tiny homes From Birds Eye view, you realize how ridiculous the desire of homeownership is. I think real estate will be the next sector that bitcoin gobbles up. The average GenZ person doesn’t care for buying a house, they want to just play pickle ball, go hiking and camping, go on road trips, buy the newest iPhone etc. Pursue their hobbies and passions. Millennials, we are a funny basket case. We used to be like GenZ, wanting to travel to planet, become a digital nomad, etc.… But somewhere along the line, maybe because of Covid, we tried to settle down and buy single-family homes instead? Or condos? I’m starting to feel like this is the early the Internet, AOL, AOL 3.0, you got mail, dial up 56K modems etc. I also like bitcoin because it is just easier to mentally and mathematically remember things. Easier to remember how many bitcoins you have on the top of your head, rather than trying to tabulate all the ones and zeros of all your fake fiat based assets? Rather than thinking about your net worth, easier to just remember your net bitcoins; ￼ Whenever I find out that somebody else is into bitcoin, I have zero issues asking them how many bitcoins they own. Why? Because it is still a relatively new field, it is awkward to ask people how much US dollars they have in their savings account, or checking account, Easier to just ask the bitcoin question. And for me, even owning a single bitcoin is like for me, owning like a square block of digital Manhattan or Kyoto. You know these rich families that own huge plots of land in desirable locations? Yeah, that’s like bitcoin. A single-family home in Beverly Hills is what like at least 5 million, 10 million, 25 million, 50 million? 100,000,000? My personal projection is if you tag the price of a bitcoin to desirable real estate in the Brentwood Hills or something, just think about what the land is worth for the Getty museum. Or like owning a piece of land or property next to the PCH in Malibu. But actually if you think about it, the value of a single bitcoin is worth 1 trillion times more than even the best property in Malibu. Why? The dangers of owning physical property, landslides, Robberies, general maintenance. The fear that your housekeeper is stealing your stuff. For example, how comfortable are you leaving your $200,000 Rolex just sitting around? Probably not very comfortable. Bitcoin is the new family jewels. Take all of your scarce desirable assets like your Rolexes, your Leica, your Porsche and just buy bitcoin instead. Because once again , to have any sort of physical property in the physical realm is a liability not an asset. I’m starting to feel more bullish, increasing my target price of bitcoin to at least $55 million a coin. Probably higher. So if that’s the case, if you took a $10,000 Rolex, and sold it, assuming that bitcoin is around $95,000 of bitcoin right now, even lower at 89,000 of bitcoin or even $85,000 of bitcoin, whatever it may… Is massive upside. 611x The $6 million Rolex? Once again, so many of these things are just liabilities. I hate the fear of having to remember where I left it, and whether it is safe, whether it was stolen or not or whatever. Rather than putting your scarce desirable things into a physical vault, isn’t it far safer for it to be in a cyber Vault, on the Blockchain? What is the Blockchain,? It is like the cloud on steroids, with 1000 X more security power and cryptographic security. It took a long time for people to trust putting files on the cloud, or photos on the cloud, but now it seems like the obvious decision. I think the reason why I like Coinbase is that rather than having to memorize some keys in my head and have a hardware physical wallet, and knowing myself I am quite forgetful, you don’t want to lose like $1 billion worth of bitcoin because you forgot your password. I think this is also where this is a huge opportunity for Apple; if we have all of our bitcoin passwords and keys linked to our iCloud account, certainly we will never stop purchasing Apple devices.

It ain’t like the Wolf of Wall Street. It’s like the wolf of cyber Wall Street.￼ Even here in Culver City, kind of like peak LA, there are so many businesses which are getting shut down like even me and Seneca’s beloved shake shack, and even more shockingly today, chipotle. If these trusted namebrand businesses are struggling in going out of business because we cannot afford to pay the rent or whatever… Isn’t this pretty bad? And also, physical entropy.

So if that’s the case, if you took a $10,000 Rolex, and sold it, assuming that bitcoin is around $95,000 of bitcoin right now, even lower at 89,000 of bitcoin or even $85,000 of bitcoin, whatever it may… Is massive upside. 611x The $6 million Rolex? Once again, so many of these things are just liabilities. I hate the fear of having to remember where I left it, and whether it is safe, whether it was stolen or not or whatever. Rather than putting your scarce desirable things into a physical vault, isn’t it far safer for it to be in a cyber Vault, on the Blockchain? What is the Blockchain,? It is like the cloud on steroids, with 1000 X more security power and cryptographic security. It took a long time for people to trust putting files on the cloud, or photos on the cloud, but now it seems like the obvious decision. I think the reason why I like Coinbase is that rather than having to memorize some keys in my head and have a hardware physical wallet, and knowing myself I am quite forgetful, you don’t want to lose like $1 billion worth of bitcoin because you forgot your password. I think this is also where this is a huge opportunity for Apple; if we have all of our bitcoin passwords and keys linked to our iCloud account, certainly we will never stop purchasing Apple devices. Even bigger, if Apple makes their own bitcoin ecosystem to custody your bitcoin in your Apple ID wallet, This could actually disrupt the whole Coinbase market. Let us consider that most of us have Apple Pay already enabled, how easy would it be to just buy bitcoin directly from your iPhone using Apple Pay? And it could be simple, you could just buy 10 bucks here, 20 bucks here, 50 bucks here, 100 bucks here etc. I don’t have an Apple credit card or bank account, but this seems like a good idea. I hate the weekends because the markets are closed. I would prefer a world in which my micro strategy stock could trade 24 7, 365, every day all day every day, on binance fidelity or something else. Apparently in 1933, the way that the traditional stock market was structured was actually to legitimately create a cartel. This is like the almost the exact opposite of American values of freedom, self sovereignty and freedom. Michael Saylor had a very interesting idea; why can you not own Apple stock directly on your Apple iPhone? There is nothing unethical about it. And technologically, we live in the year 2024 of course could be physically possible. Even the stock market is mostly driven by robots, you no longer have guys on the slips of paper. It ain’t like the Wolf of Wall Street. It’s like the wolf of cyber Wall Street.￼ When in doubt, just buy more Bitcoin! ALL OPEN SOURCE EVERYTHING! EK IDEAS

When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. If you’re looking for a deal on anything Apple sells—an iPad, Apple Watch, AirPods, MacBook, iPhone or anything else—there’s no better time to get one than Black Friday. No matter what you’re looking to buy, you’re going to find a great price—and some are at the lowest we’ve ever seen. The sales start earlier every year, but the best deals are usually seen between Black Friday (November 29) and Cyber Monday (December 2). However, as we head into Black Friday week, we’re already seeing fantastic deals, so you might not want to wait. We’ll be updating this page regularly as more discounts come in. If you want to know what Apple is doing for Black Friday, it’s offering gift cards up to $200/£160 with select purchases. We have the details of that deal and what’s included in our Apple’s 2024 Black Friday Shopping Event article. Black Friday is a great time to get an Apple product for less, but the discounts come and go very quickly. Stay tuned to this page up to and throughout the Black Friday weekend as we update you with the best prices on new Apple products as they arrive. Many of the best deals we see are on Amazon U.S. or Amazon U.K., but we’ll also be checking resellers such as Best Buy, B&H and Walmart in the U.S. and KRCS, AO, Argos, John Lewis, Currys, Laptops Direct and eBuyer in the U.K. Apple released new MacBook Pros with M4 chips in late October 2024. At the same time, it upgraded the RAM in all MacBook Air models from 8GB to 16GB for the same starting prices, effectively a $200/£200 discount. So if you’re shopping make sure the model you’re buying has 16GB of RAM. We don’t recommend buying a model with 8GB of RAM unless it’s much more than $200/£200 cheaper than the 16GB model. U.S. Foundry Additionally, Apple’s older MacBook Pro models are on clearance as retailers look to clear out remaining stock: U.K. Apple’s older MacBook models are on clearance at the following retailers: The iMac and Mac mini both received new M4 chips in October, with the Mac mini also getting a dramatic redesign that shrunk the case down to just 5 inches. Like the MacBooks, these new Macs now start at 16GB of RAM, an option that was previously an extra $200/£200. So be sure to double-check that you’re buying the updated model with an M4 processor. Older iMacs only offer 8GB of RAM, so the price should match that. Grab money off a new iMac. Foundry U.S. There are savings on the older models as well: U.K. In the U.K. when Apple announced the iMac and Mac mini in 2024 it dropped prices compared to the previous generation, so keep this in mind if considering a discount on an M3 model. These older models are also discounted: The AirPods 4 with and without ANC are Apple’s newest earbuds that replaced the AirPods generation 2 and 3 in September. Apple also updated the AirPods Max with a USB-C port in September, but otherwise, it’s the same as the Lightning model. And while the AirPods Pro 2 are a couple of years old, Apple added a new feature in iOS 18,1 that lets it work as a hearing aid. We usually see some tremendous savings on the standard AirPods over Black Friday, but this year beware: you may see a blowout deal on the older models, but unless you’re on a very tight budget, our advice is that even if you see a good deal on the AirPods 3 you should spring for one of the AirPods 4 models on sale even if they cost more. The AirPods 4 without ANC cost $129/£129 and compare very favorably with the AirPods 3 which used to cost $179/£179. AirPods 4 are Apple’s newest earbuds and are already on sale. Petter Ahrnstedt U.S. U.K. There are also savings on older models, but as we mentioned above, we recommend skipping any AirPods 3rd gen deals because the AirPods 4 are much better. Mike Sawh Apple launched the Apple Watch Series 10 with a slightly larger screen in September 2024 as well as a new black color for the Apple Watch Ultra. Traditionally, any savings around $50 is an excellent deal. Look out for the Apple Watch Series 9 as there may be some deals on the discontinued model. U.S. U.K. Apple updated all of its iPads in 2024 with the exception of the 10th-gen entry-level model (though it did get a price cut to $349). The iPad mini was the most recent model to get a refresh, with a new chip and 8GB of RAM. We are seeing some good deals on new iPads. Foundry U.S. U.K. U.S. Most iPhone deals in the U.S. are through carriers and require a trade-in or adding a new line. You can read our best Black Friday iPhone deals roundup for more information. U.K. David Price / Foundry In October, Apple updated its Mac accessories with USB-C ports but didn’t bring any other changes. If you’re buying a new Apple Pencil the Apple Pencil Pro is the newest model and compatible with the iPad Pro, iPad Air, and iPad mini. The USB-C Apple Pencil is also compatible with these models as well as the 10th-gen iPad, but doesn’t have squeeze gestures or magnetic charging. If you see a deal on the any Apple Pencils make sure they work with your iPad! Thiago Trevisan/Foundry U.S. U.K. Every year Apple holds a shopping event from Black Friday (November 29 in 2024) to Cyber Monday (December 2). However, since Apple rarely discounts its products, the event consists of gift card offers rather than actual savings. The newest products are excluded, so don’t expect any offers on the iPhone 16 or new MacBooks. You can get gift cards for the following amounts with the following purchases made on Apple’s U.S. site or Apple’s U.K. site. Here’s how it compares to last year and the year before. Stay tuned to Macworld throughout November to find the best deals as they arrive. But if you’re looking for a specific color or capacity, you can check out the following retailers.
