Nintendo just hiked the price up on the popular Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller once again. After being announced at $80 back in April before jumping up to $85 ahead of launch, it just saw its MSRP rise again to $90 as part of Nintendo sweeping price hikes that just went live over the weekend. After going out of stock at most major retailers shortly thereafter, you can once again score a “deal” on one at $84.99 via Amazon and even less than that if you’re a Costco member. Again, the price is now officially $90 on the Switch 2 Pro Controller – one of the most popular Switch 2 accessories anywhere. This price is now reflected directly on the Nintendo Store as well select major retailers online (where you can find it in stock). However, anyone can go score one on Amazon right now for $84.99 shipped, which is indeed the launch price but is now $5 under the price of the new MSRP. There’s no telling how long a controller that might not actually see a deep deal for a year or perhaps even more will even be available at this price. Just keep in mind, that if you’re already a paid Costco member, you can score it for even less. Costco already had a deal on the Switch 2 Pro Controller running at $74.99 for more than a few weeks now, but its listing remains impervious to price hikes and is still sitting down at the lowest price we have tracked in brand new condition at retail. Now, the cost of the membership just to score the deal likely isn’t worth it, unless you plan on actually making use of the yearly sub, but for folks already invested in the warehouse box store, this is the best deal around. Nintendo recently announced and put into place price hikes across the previous-generation Switch 1 hardware and it has now taken effect on a number of the Switch Online controllers as well as the Switch 2 Pro Controller and the Switch 2 Joy-Con – the complete details on all of this awaits right here – and it is perhaps only a matter of time before the price jumps land on Switch 2 consoles as well.
