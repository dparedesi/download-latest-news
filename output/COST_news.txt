Costco (COST+1.75%) is best known for its no-frills, bulk-buying experience, but the warehouse giant also moves a surprising amount of luxury goods. From Rolex watches to gold bars, high-end items have become an integral part of the business, and according to Hamilton “Tony” James, chairman of Costco, wealthier shoppers are hooked. “We’ve known we could move anything in volume if the quality was good and the price was great,” James said in an interview with Chief Executive magazine. That’s partly why the retail giant sells everything from Dom Perignon to 10-karat diamonds. According to James, Costco’s members are not just average-income households – they also include wealthier shoppers who recognize a good deal when they see one, like a Porsche on the sales floor of a Costco in Seattle. Costco, known for its “treasure hunt” shopping experience, won’t sell just anything. Unlike rivals Amazon (AMZN-2.65%) and Walmart (WMT+3.62%), Costco is selective about what it sells. While big-box retailers like Walmart stock over 120,000 different items, Costco limits its selection to about 3,400 stock-keeping units (SKUs). “We’re not interested in selling just anything at a low price,” James said. Instead of offering a $500 TV for $250, Costco would rather sell a $1,000 TV for $500. This formula has been a massive profit boost, further buoyed by the recent surge in gold bar sales. Wells Fargo (WFC-2.61%) noted last year in a research report that the company moved between $100 million and $200 million worth of gold bars each month. James told the magazine he wasn’t sure whether affluent shoppers or those wary of the economy were driving gold bar demand, but either way, the strategy has set Costco apart. He expressed confidence in the company’s position against Amazon and Walmart, noting that Costco focuses on its own approach rather than its competitors’ moves. Walmart-owned Sam’s Club, however, dethroned Costco to claim the top spot in the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) 2024 rankings for general merchandise retailers. Another area where Costco continues to be an outlier is in its commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). While many corporations, such as Walmart, McDonald’s (MCD+0.86%), and Target (TGT+0.86%), have scaled back on their DEI plans, Costco has held firm.

Heavenly Homemakers Encouraging women in homemaking, healthy eating and parenting February 23, 2025 by Laura 2 Comments Here’s our Big Family Food and Fun: February 16-22, 2025 post! Before launching into the week’s food and fun, I’ll share the tail end of last week’s fun. We were home relaxing for Sabbath that evening, enjoying fun treats and family time. Dinner that night was Fish Sandwiches – or just Fish Sticks for those who didn’t want a bun. We went through an entire Costco-sized bag of sticks, reminding me that almost everyone in our household likes these and it makes an easy meal that is different from our norm. Mental note: add fish sticks to the upcoming Costco list… Our Sabbath dinner also featured special sparkling water and the kids’ choice of a dessert. We practiced memorizing scripture while we ate and talked through what these verses mean in our lives. Sunday morning, we ate what has become our traditional, effortless Sabbath Sunday morning breakfast: Breakfast Cookie Bars that I’d made ahead and frozen. We had a lovely group join us at lunchtime, with 25 of us around the table that day. We had asked one of the families to please pick up Rotisserie Chicken from Sam’s on their way here, which they were happy to do (plus they brought their traditional Doritos that the kids all love). So our meal that day was three Rotisserie Chickens with Homemade Bread and Butter, Green Beans, Potato Salad, and Oatmeal Butterscotch Cookies. It was all so simple and so good, and a wonderful time of fellowship. Ms. Megan had brought a Color Wonder kit so many of the kids joined her around the living room table before and after lunch to color. :) Later that afternoon, we loaded our family up for a Kid Event at the Mall. Our friend Caitlyn had been at our house for lunch and joined us on our outing. Malachi hopped in too, plus our friend/housemate, Kermit. It was great to have so many adult helpers! The kids got free books, water bottles, games, and bubbles. They got to golf and play instruments. We had decided to make the most of this outing since we had braved the cold to get to the mall. So when the event ended, we headed over to the play area (as did many of the other families with kids at the event – so it was packed!). Malachi needed some new business-casual clothes for his work, so while the kids played, some of us went next door into H&M to shop. We scored some great deals from their clearance racks! And Anna made a new friend… I had packed us a picnic dinner – something we haven’t been able to do all winter long. But this was a great opportunity to enjoy a winter picnic, so we headed to the food court tables and had Peanut Butter Jelly Sandwiches, Salami, Cheese Sticks, Apples, Applesauce, and Carrots. As we were finishing up our meal, Matt bought an order of fries for everyone to have a small surprise treat before we headed home. There was no school on Monday or Tuesday of this week (pre-scheduled days off). It snowed all morning and part of the afternoon so we just hung out in the house, trying to keep kids busy. Brayden and Keith became occupied with Legos for two entire hours, creating the beginnings of a Lego City! Breakfast and Lunch that day was an assortment of leftovers as we finished up tidbits of Breakfast Cookie Bars, Chili, and Noodles throughout the morning/afternoon. I made a pot of broth that morning with the leftover chicken bones from the three Rotisserie Chickens the day before. For dinner that night, I used the broth to make Simple Chicken Noodle Soup. Tuesday was another scheduled day off from school. (With the weather being what it was, likely the kids would have had a snow day anyway!) I made Blender Pancakes for our breakfast that morning. Being cooped up in the house for the second day in a row was starting to affect everyone. So we tried to keep the kids busy with activities. They’d been listening to “Wavin’ Flag” on Alexa quite a bit, so I looked up the back story to talk through the origin of the song with them. Then we got out supplies to make flags. Was it the most exciting idea I’ve ever come up with? Nope. But did it kill twenty minutes of our day? Yep. So it was a win. Hahaha, Acacia’s enthusiasm… :) Brayden was excited to help me make lunch, so he cut up Beef Smoked Sausages to cook. While the rest of our lunch was cooking, the girls helped me make Breakfast Cookie Bars for upcoming Sabbath Sunday breakfasts. Lunch was a very exciting offering of Sausages, Mac and Cheese, and Peas. Mmm, the Breakfast Cookie Bars turned out just right this time. Matt played a game with Brayden and Kiya that afternoon… Then our friend, Cindy, and two of her kids came to hang out. This was such a blessing for our evening as our kids love playing with her kids and Cindy poured love into our family the entire time she was here. Brayden and Kiya helped her make little Pigs in a Blanket to go with our dinner. We enjoyed a fun meal of Chicken Nuggets/Strips, Pigs in a Blanket, Fries, Fruit, and Salad. Wednesday turned out to be a Snow/Cold Day off from school. Anna helped me make a batch of Flourless Chocolate Banana Blender Muffins that morning. Did she get to lick a spatula after we got the batter mixed up? And had Josie made her way into the kitchen and needed a spatula to lick also? The Flourless Chocolate Banana Blender Muffins turned out great and helped us get through the day as everyone needed something to munch on. At lunchtime. Acacia helped me prepare leftovers. I was determined to clean out the fridge so we got out jars of pickles to finish off along with our lunch. She felt it was necessary to open the jars with the rubber gripper. It was a big day for some of the adult Coppingers! Matt, the four older boys, and Malorie had bought tickets to go to KC to watch Messi play. The weather postponed the game, and yet Wednesday’s rescheduled game was still going to be played in freezing cold temps. Did they decide to still go? Yes, they did. Did they realize they were a bit crazy for all of this? Also, yes. Did Arrow fully support their choices?? Everyone gathered at the Castle and we sent off the heavily bundled up soccer fans (Matt, Asa, Justus, Elias, Malorie, Malachi, plus two friends from Lincoln who hopped in). Eva, Kelsey, Arrow, and Little Sweetheart stayed back at the Castle with me to help with kids throughout the afternoon/evening. Eva read lots of books to the littles. At one point I think she had six kids piled around her, but they scattered before I could get a picture of them all. Kelsey played several games at the table. We needed something active to do (it day three in a row of not leaving the house, oy!). So I told the kids that if they cleaned up the living room and play room, we’d be able to set up an Obstacle Course like I had done a few weeks ago. Auggie got a turn with the vacuum. :) Eva captured this shot of me explaining the obstacle course to the kids. It started at the bottom of one set of stairs, went all the way through the living room and playroom, up the other set of stairs, and back. Phew. It involved masking tape and sour cream lids (fancy!). The kids wound their way around the house over and over. Meanwhile, Eva and Kelsey took advantage of the kids being occupied to put their babies in the high chairs to feed them. Look at Lolli’s grandbabies eating like big kids. :) :) :) Knowing the day would be full, I’d put Spicy Ham and Potato Soup in a crock pot that morning. At dinnertime, we served it up – so easy. I had kind of been dreading the day that Matt and so many other adults would be heading out of town, leaving us behind with kids. But wow was it great having Eva and Kelsey and their babies here! I truly enjoyed the day with them and am so thankful for the gals our boys have chosen. OUR DAUGHTERS-IN-LAW ARE AMAZING! MEANWHILE, in Kansas City at the game, Messi scored a goal right in front of our crew. AND, while cheering, several of our peeps made it on television. A couple of friends watching the game from home realized, “Hey, that’s the Coppingers!” so they got screen shots and sent them to our boys. It is so much fun to have this shot of Asa, Justus, Elias, and Malorie! For the record, after this moment, everyone determined that it had, in fact, been worth it to drive all the way there and freeze half-way-to-death to be a part of this moment. Thursday was – guess what? – another Snow/Cold Day off from school. The weather promised to warm up over the weekend, but meanwhile, the temps were still dangerously cold. So, while we considered leaving the house to keep us all from going stir-crazy, we just didn’t want to endure the misery of the cold. So we hunkered down at home, trying to maintain peace while we played. I’d pulled out a pan of Chicken Cheeseballs from the freezer that I’d made a few weeks ago, so we baked them for lunch. I also made two tortilla packages worth of Quesadillas and opened three cans of fruit for our meal. After lunch, I baked two pans of rice and browned 2.5 pounds of hamburger meat. I stirred all of the rice and cooked meat into a large pan and turned it into a form of Taco Rice Skillet for our upcoming Sunday Lunch. That afternoon, I pulled kids into the kitchen to help me make Peanut Butter Honey Fudge. I had almost forgotten this recipe, but it was a perfect treat to make since we were cooped up and needed an activity. Brayden got to to do the stove-top part of this. Then we scooped the mixture into fun molds, then the rest into a dish. Dinner that night was Costco’s Tortelloni with Sauce plus Steamed Broccoli. A few years ago, I did a price breakdown to share that this entire meal only cost $1.41/person. Want to see what the cost is after inflation 2.5 years later? I did the math!! After dinner, we ate some Peanut Butter Honey Fudge! Then we spent the rest of the evening playing Charades. Oh, and Kelsey sent me this delicious picture of their dinner that night: Simple Pizza Chicken Bake! With a January full of sickness and a February full of freezing cold temps and a household full of constant intense-kid-needs, I felt like I’d been hanging on for dear life. I have been getting up early each morning to have some glorious time in the Word and in prayer. But otherwise, I’m on the go all day with needs piled on top of each other. God made it very clear to me on Friday morning that I needed to meet my own needs so that I could effectively care for my family. So as soon as I was able, I packed myself up and headed out the door. (The kids were able to be back in school that day!) I sat at Panera by the fire with a cup of coffee, resting and working. In a setting like this, my work is restful, which is a blessing. Feeling refreshed and enjoying my alone time, I headed next door to Costco. I looked through clothing for clearance sales, then filled the bottom of my cart with fresh produce. I then decided that since I was kid-free, I should stock up on everything we’d finished off at home during the past couple of months. Did I need a second cart? Yes. But did I get one? No. I just kept piling my one cart higher and higher. Craziness. Back at home, Matt and I got groceries brought in and put away before picking up kids from school. I had a smile back on my face again, thanks to the down time I’d enjoyed. Anna washed grapes for our dinner while Brayden and Kiya helped with other parts of our meal. We had Grilled Cheese Sandwiches, Tomato Soup, Onion Rings, and Grapes. Saturday morning, Malorie and I left all the kids home with the guys while we headed to church for a Ladies’ Brunch. The speaker was none other than our very dear Kelsey. The morning was incredibly wonderful in so many ways and I’m so thankful we got to do this. Back at home, Asa, Arrow, Justus, and Little Sweetheart had joined our crew so I went home to kids, grandbabies, and big boys. I felt so filled and blessed. The Italian Cream Cheese Chicken I’d started before the brunch smelled good when we got back! That evening, we were planning to celebrate Justus’ birthday a week late, and this was his dinner choice. Malachi had made a batch of Hot Cocoa while we were gone. I love that he does this! Brayden and Kiya helped me make Butterscotch Bars for the night’s birthday celebration. We slid them into the oven, I finished this post, we got some cleaning done, then the family joined for Justus’ birthday. And that was our week!

Title: Shake Shack's CEO said the cost of eggs will likely drive up demand for beef and chicken

Shake Shack's CEO, Rob Lynch, says food chains will likely introduce more chicken and beef menu items as the price of eggs soars. On the company's fourth-quarter earnings call on Thursday, Lynch discussed the impact of tariffs and imports on the burger chain's business. Lynch said the company sources the majority of its ingredients domestically and won't have major exposure to tariffs. Thanks to its menu, it is largely insulated from the skyrocketing price of eggs as well. "I mean we don't have a breakfast business, a big breakfast business. So we don't have the exposure to eggs," Lynch said. "But other restaurant companies that have exposure to eggs may be moving away from eggs in the time being, which means they are going to offer more beef products or chicken products to complement, to substitute for that high-cost item," he said. Shake Shack is known for its beef, chicken, and mushroom burgers, as well as its fries and frozen custard shakes. While eggs don't play heavily into its menu, fast food giants from Chick-fil-A and Taco Bell to McDonald's and Burger King rely on eggs for some of their popular breakfast menu items. Lynch's comments come as egg prices in the US soar. Prices increased by 15.2% from December to January, the largest monthly spike in 10 years. In January, the average price of a dozen large Grade A eggs in the country hit an all-time high of $4.95. The surge was caused due to supply chain issues stemming from a H5N1 bird flu outbreak in the US. The flu has forced farmers to cull infected birds, leading to egg shortages. Chains like Costco have seen egg cartons fly off their shelves minutes after store openings. Grocery stores like Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, and Costco have imposed limits on the number of cartons each customer can purchase. Earlier this month, Waffle House started adding a 50-cent surcharge to each egg it sells. Shake Shack, which started as a hot dog kiosk in New York City's Madison Square Park in 2004, has over 570 locations worldwide, including more than 370 outlets in the US. The chain posted a total quarterly revenue of $329 million, up 14.8% from the same quarter in 2023. This included $317 million of company-operated sales and about $12 million from licensing revenue. The company's stock was up 11% at market close on Thursday. It's up more than 27% in the past year. Representatives for Shake Shack did not respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.
