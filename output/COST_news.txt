How successful is Costco? The warehouse giant recently reported net sales of roughly $21 billionâand that was just for the month of July 2025. The membership club attracts and keeps customers spending those billions by offering a wide variety of high-quality products at discount prices. Consumers are especially devoted to their Kirkland Signature line, the brandâs in-house label that covers everything from tea to toilet paper. Sometimes, well-reviewed items donât stay on shelves. For a variety of reasons, Costco has discontinued, eliminated, or otherwise removed popular products. Take a look at 10 retired items that caused a lot of member uproar. (Note: Some items may have been reported as discontinued, only to return as a seasonal item or in a revamped version. Itâs always possible youâll spot a lamented and presumed-lost item at your local Costco.) The $1.50 hot dog and soda combo aside, Costcoâs food court might be the most unpredictable department in the chain. In 2024, the store opted to remove its twisted churros (fried and sugar-dusted dough) from the menu. According to The Spruce Eats, it was the second time Costco had ditched the dessert, having discontinued an untwisted version back in 2021. In its place was a double chocolate chunk cookie. If that doesnât fill the churro-sized hole in your gut, you can opt for the prepackaged Gen Bake Churro Donut Bites. Costcoâs musical chairs at the food court persisted with the removal of their Polish hot dog, a spicy sausage variation of their classic, back in 2018. In a rare moment of public contrition over a defunct item, Costco stated that âIn order to simplify our menu and make room for healthier options, we have decided to offer only the all-beef Hot Dog. Sales show this is what the majority of members prefer. Though we understand many members loved the Polish Dog, we hope you enjoy our new offerings.â Add Mental Floss as a preferred news source! This chocolate-on-chocolate-on-chocolate layer cake was a favorite among bakery customers for its uninhibited decadence. The 7-pound chocolate cake with a chocolate mousse center was surrounded by fudge icing and chocolate shavings. A combination of pandemic cutbacks and modest sales led to it being pulled, though loyalists tried to get Costco to reverse course: A Change.org petition to bring the cake back drew over 8500 signatures. It didnât work, but Costco does offer a miniature version sans the mousse center. This dairy-free alternative was sold in 32-ounce containers (in packs of 12) and became popular among those unable or unwilling to tolerate lactose. Then, in 2025, it was swiftly pulled: consumers began leaving âreviewsâ on Costcoâs website imploring them to bring it back. According to Readerâs Digest, poor sales were to blame, though the company might introduce another branded soy milk in the near future. As late as 2013, Costco members could approach the food court and request that an employee hand-dip an ice cream bar in vats of chocolate and almonds. Those days are now over. One possible motive was the rising prices of dairy and almonds at the time. That, coupled with poor sales, may have led to its demise. A few years later, chocolate yogurt was also pulled from the menu. In its placeâat least in San Luis Obispo, Californiaâwas an aÃ§aÃ­ bowl. Costcoâs $1.99 pizza slices have stirred up strong feelings among customers. Aside from cheese and pepperoni, there used to be a third option: a combo, or supreme, pizza that consisted of sausage, red onions, pepperoni, green bell peppers, mushrooms, and black olives. It disappeared from the food court in 2020, but not from the store itself. A take-and-bake frozen version is still available in select regions. In 2025, the store was also offering a combo calzone with many of the same ingredients but at a steeper $6.99 price. Home baking enthusiasts were dismayed by the abrupt disappearance of Kirklandâs semi-sweet chocolate chips and 51 percent semi-sweet chips in 2024. The reason? Costco was having trouble keeping its price competitive given the rising cost of cocoa. Instead, the warehouse is offering NestlÃ© Toll House semi-sweet chocolate morsels. Costcoâs bakery was once home to enormous breakfast muffins. As is the custom in warehouse clubs, consumers were forced to purchase them in twin packs of 6 (12 total), making for a true commitment to carbs. In 2024, the company replaced the jumbo muffins with a smaller version, allegedly in response to people complaining there was simply too much muffin to consume at once.Â The muffin serving might have shrunk, but the price did not. At $6.99 per 8-pack, the reasonable size is 50 percent more expensive than the jumbo muffins ($9.99 for 12) on a per-ounce basis. Perk Description Home and Auto Insurance Members can get a break on insurance premiums via Costco's partnership with Connect. In-Home Water Delivery Costco delivers Primo water and offers dispenser rentals for home or office. Tech Support Costco can walk members through new TV, PC, and phone gadgets via a toll-free number (866-861-0450). Travel Packages Members can save on vacation packages when booking via Costco. Bulk Movie Tickets Love movies? You can save on admission by buying Regal, Cinemark, or AMC gift cards or bulk tickets sold for less than face value While not an exclusive item, books are nonetheless no more at Costco. After years of selling hardcover and paperback titles at a discount, in 2024 the company announced it would no longer be regularly stocking books. The sheer tonnage of titles made restocking labor-intensive for employees. Instead, Costco plans to offer books during the fall and winter holiday buying season only. If you donât remember grabbing Kirkland-branded mayo in recent years, thereâs a reason: Costco actually discontinued the product before it ever reached store shelves. The company had issues with its supplier perfecting the recipe: The addition of omega-3 fatty acids, intended to boost its nutritional profile, wound up disrupting the consistency. The company may try again in the future. In the meantime, thereâs always 64 ounces of Hellmanâs.

You might know Dollar Tree stores are small for a good reason — it helps the company keep operating costs down. The stores then pass those savings on to consumers in the form of lower prices in hopes of keeping their shoppers coming back. Although the quality of some dollar store products is questionable, you can find some legitimately good deals if you know what to look for. Considering Americans' spending on Christmas and the holidays is expected to exceed $890 per person in 2025, according to the National Retail Foundation, cutting corners where you can isn't a bad idea. Save some money now by doing a bit of early holiday shopping at your local Dollar Tree. We've put together a list of the best deals at Dollar Tree for the month of October, all of which cost $5 or less per item. You can also shop online at Dollar Tree's website, though you may have to purchase some of these items in bulk which could drive up the total price. But if you have a Dollar Tree nearby, keep reading for the best ways to save. After the excitement of Halloween ends, all the candy is consumed, and the weather starts to turn cooler, kids might need some quieter activities they can do indoors. The Crayola Children's Painting Kit features a character's outline on a sheet of paper. The child can then use the included containers of watercolor paint to color the drawing. Each kit costs $1.75 at Dollar Tree. If you order online, you'll have to buy 20 kits for $35, which could make them a solid party favor or stocking stuffer for all the young kids in your life. The characters featured in the kits are all well-known figures from Disney and Marvel, including Stitch, Minnie Mouse, Spider-Man, and Super Kitties, so there's a good chance the kids will be excited to see them. Each kit contains a brush and four small paint containers, and the colors included depend on the selected character. Minnie Mouse has light yellow, light green, light pink, and hot pink paints, while Stitch has blue, yellow, red, and white paint containers. The instructions also reveal how you can make even more colors by mixing paints. Each kit is recommended for children ages 4 and higher. Whether you like wearing low-cut socks for physical activities or as a simple finishing touch on a formal outfit, you might appreciate having them on hand in significant quantities. When you have low-cut socks in abundance, you don't have to worry as much about getting caught short if your only pair wears thin or ends up with holes. Dollar Tree can help you build out your collection with a pack of 20 Women's Black Athletic Low-Cut Socks (10 pairs) that cost $3 per pack (or 30 cents per pair). If you buy them online, you'll have to buy a quantity of 12 packs — or 120 pairs — which will set you up for quite a while. The socks are made for women with shoe sizes between 5 and 9. Each sock consists of 98% polyester and 2% spandex. "They're thin, breathable, [and] washable athletic socks," said one Dollar Tree reviewer who buys the socks for their own use and donates them to food banks. Some Dollar Tree kitchen items are so affordable, you might not believe the savings. Even better, you can actually buy some well-known household brand name kitchen products at Dollar Tree. One such item that is both inexpensive and features a brand name is the Rubbermaid TakeAlongs Storage Bowls With Lids, which cost $1.50 for a pack of two bowls and lids. If you buy them online, you'll have to purchase a minimum of 12 packs, getting you 24 bowls and lids total, for $18. Each container can hold about three cups of food, which is perfect for sharing cookies and other holiday goodies with neighbors and friends without overdoing it. The container uses transparent plastic with a red lid. Rubbermaid is well-known for having reusable glass and plastic food containers, some of which are made for dozens of uses. You can wash and reuse these TakeAlongs products, too, but they'll need replacing if they show signs of visible wear. According to Dollar Tree's website, they are BPA-free, and safe to put in the microwave and dishwasher. If you're tired of the various marks and scratches that show up in plastic cutting boards, you may want to consider switching to a more durable, sustainable material. Bamboo cutting boards deliver this benefit, serving as a renewable material with a slightly rustic look to class up your kitchen. Bamboo is considered a renewable resource because it is a woody grass that multiplies and grows quickly, unlike trees. Cooking Concepts Bamboo Cutting Boards cost $1.25 apiece at Dollar Tree. And while online shoppers will need to buy a minimum of 24 boards, that still comes out to just $30. Each board measures 6.7 by 9.8 inches, which is large enough to chop all kinds of food while small enough to fit easily in a drawer or cupboard. While they're not dishwasher safe, they are versatile: In addition to making a great chopping surface, they also make the perfect platform for serving hors d'oeuvres. One Dollar Tree customer even used a laser machine to cut words and graphics into the surface to give them as custom gifts. If you love the idea of giving homemade gifts at the holidays, Dollar Tree and other dollar stores can give you a bargain on the starting point for the materials for many different craft projects. For many people, creating DIY snow globes is a favorite crafty holiday tradition. In addition to using them as homemade, personalized gifts, you can use the snow globes for affordable decorations around your house. With winter fast approaching, why not start on these projects a couple of months before the holidays arrive? Although some people use mason jars with lids to create homemade snow globes, Dollar Tree has products available that give you the traditional globe shape and the base to hold the globe upright. Dollar Tree's DIY Customizable Holiday Snow Globe Decorations cost $1.50 each. If you're shopping online, you'll have to buy 24 of them for a total of $36, and each clear globe measures almost 4 inches in diameter. When the base is attached, the unit measures 4.25 inches in height. Then, all you need is glitter, glycerine, water, and some tiny figurines to create the snow globe of your dreams. "Great for what I need it for," says one Dollar Tree customer reviewer. "Just the right size and not cheaply made."
