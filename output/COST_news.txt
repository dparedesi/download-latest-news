By Erin Gobler Edited By Angelica Leicht February 25, 2025 / 9:51 AM EST / CBS News Gold as an investment dates back to roughly 550 BC, long before modern investments like stocks and index funds, but it remains an important part of the investment landscape today. In fact, Americans generally believe gold to be a better long-term investment than stocks, savings accounts or bonds, according to a recent Gallup poll. And, interest in gold is only growing now that the price of gold has been climbing. After breaking numerous records on its price run in 2024 — and a renewed upward climb since the start of 2025 — the price of gold now sits close to $2,950 per ounce. However, that's just the spot price of gold, which isn't necessarily the same price you'll pay as an investor. So, it's important to understand how sellers set the retail price of gold, which is information you can use to find the best deal when shopping for your gold investment. Learn more about how to start investing in gold now. The current price of gold is known as its spot price. But as an investor, that's not typically the price you'll pay. "At its core, gold pricing follows a simple formula: Spot price + premium = Retail price," says Nidhi Singhvi, co-founder and CEO of the jewelry store Sonolore. The premium is an additional cost that's added to the spot price to account for business costs, including production and distribution, as well as profit margins. According to Singvi, dealers each set their own premiums and may adjust their retail prices as the spot price changes, which could happen daily. Retailers may also adjust their premiums to account for changes in the gold market, such as high demand or limited supply, even if the spot price hasn't necessarily changed. Another factor that can affect your costs is the physical form of the gold you're purchasing. For example, the choice between gold bars and coins, as well as any additional designs included, may raise or lower your costs. Generally speaking, the simpler and less processed the gold you're purchasing, the lower the premium will be. "Here is where things get interesting and opaque — premiums vary wildly by seller," says Singhvi. "A gold bar from a major retailer like Costco might have a lower markup than a boutique coin shop, while a luxury brand might charge an exorbitant premium." Gold differs from other popular investments in this way. For example, you wouldn't expect the price of a popular stock or index fund to be markedly different from one broker to the next, but you could find stark differences in the price of gold. For that reason, it's important to shop around to compare prices at various dealers. Make sure to add in any added costs, including shipping costs, transaction fees and storage (if applicable). Find out how gold could benefit your investment portfolio. When the spot price of gold increases, you can expect the retail price to rise along with it. Various factors can affect gold's spot price. For example, just like any other asset, the price of gold generally follows supply and demand. If demand is high and supply is low, the price is likely to increase. Gold prices can also be affected by economic conditions, both locally and globally. Changes in interest rates, inflation and other asset markets can all play a role. Additionally, the gold spot price may fluctuate in response to geopolitical events. The demand for gold — and, therefore, the price of gold — may increase during times of uncertainty like war or significant market downturns. Gold is traded all over the world, meaning events and economic factors in more than just the U.S. can affect its price. "While prices have already reached record highs, macroeconomic factors suggest continued demand, supporting the potential for further gains," says Joseph Cavatoni of the World Gold Council. First, gold is considered a hedge against inflation, in part thanks to its limited supply. And while inflation isn't as high today as it was just a couple of years ago, the latest data shows an uptick in the inflation rate. And according to Cavatoni, gold can protect investors from far more than inflation. "Given the current economic uncertainty, geopolitical risks, and volatility in risk assets, gold continues to prove its value as a safe-haven investment," says Cavatoni. Gold has plenty of other benefits worth considering, including portfolio diversification and liquidity, not to mention an increasing number of ways to invest. In addition to buying physical gold, investors can also opt for options like gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or gold mining ETFs. If you're going to invest in gold, knowing the spot price of gold isn't necessarily enough. After all, dealers typically add a premium to the price, which accounts for things like business costs, profit margins, gold storage, and more. If you're considering investing in gold, shop around for the best price — this can help you find a dealer that charges a lower premium. That being said, it is also helpful to monitor the current spot price and know which factors, from inflation to interest rate to market events, may impact it. © 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

These five stocks represent compelling investment opportunities for March 2025, offering a mix of ... [+] growth potential, competitive advantages, and strong fundamentals. In today's market environment, finding the right stocks requires careful analysis of company fundamentals and broader economic trends. With inflation showing signs of cooling and the Federal Reserve hinting at potential rate cuts later this year, certain sectors are particularly well-positioned for growth. This article examines five compelling stock picks that offer strong potential for capital appreciation and steady returns. These selections come from diverse sectors, including technology, healthcare and consumer discretionary, providing investors with opportunities for portfolio diversification. Each company demonstrates solid fundamentals, strong market positioning, and compelling growth catalysts, making them attractive investment options for March 2025 and beyond. This selection process focused on companies with strong fundamentals, sustainable competitive advantages and clear growth catalysts. I evaluated each stock using a comprehensive framework that considered financial metrics such as revenue growth, profit margins and return on equity, as well as qualitative factors, including market position, management quality and industry trends. Special attention was paid to companies with proven track records of navigating economic uncertainties while maintaining strong balance sheets. Additionally, I considered current market conditions and sector-specific trends that could impact performance over the next 12-24 months. Each company was assessed for its valuation relative to peers and historical averages, ensuring that our picks offer reasonable entry points for investors despite the market's recent gains. Microsoft continues to dominate the enterprise software market while making significant strides in cloud computing and artificial intelligence. The company's Azure cloud platform has become a cornerstone of its business, consistently gaining market share against competitors. Microsoft's strategic acquisition of Activision Blizzard and its partnership with OpenAI has further strengthened its position in gaming and AI technologies, creating multiple growth vectors for the future. Microsoft's compelling investment case rests on its exceptional market position across multiple high-growth segments and its proven ability to monetize new technologies. The company's AI integration across its product suite, particularly in Microsoft 365 and Azure, has created significant competitive advantages and new revenue streams. With enterprise IT spending expected to remain robust and the continued shift toward cloud computing, Microsoft is well-positioned to maintain its growth trajectory. Furthermore, with nearly one billion dollars in cash and liquid assets (MSFT 10K), Microsoft's strong balance sheet provides ample resources for continued innovation and strategic acquisitions. The company's consistent dividend growth and share buyback program offer additional value to shareholders, making it an attractive option for growth and income investors. UnitedHealth Group is the largest healthcare company by revenue globally, operating through two platforms: UnitedHealthcare (health insurance) and Optum (healthcare services). The company's integrated approach to healthcare delivery and technology-driven solutions has created a powerful competitive moat. Its Optum division continues to drive innovation in healthcare delivery while expanding margins. UnitedHealth's combination of scale, technological innovation and vertical integration makes it uniquely positioned to benefit from healthcare sector growth. The company's investments in artificial intelligence and data analytics are improving operational efficiency and patient outcomes while reducing costs. The aging U.S. population and increasing healthcare spending provide strong secular tailwinds for continued growth. The drop in price after its CEO was assassinated brought the company down to a more attractive level. The company's consistent execution and strong financial performance, evidenced by nearly double-digit consecutive quarters of earnings beats, demonstrate management's ability to navigate complex healthcare regulations while maintaining profitability. UnitedHealth's dividend growth history and reasonable payout ratio suggest room for continued dividend increases. This stock looks even more attractive after its 12% drop on February 21, following the U.S. Department of Justice's announcement of a civil fraud probe into the company’s Medicare billing. I believe this lawsuit does not significantly threaten the company’s long-term prospects. The market may be reacting out of fear, especially with the upcoming trial of Luigi Mangione, the suspected murderer of UNH’s CEO, which could be casting a negative spotlight on the company. I suggest waiting for a slightly more significant pullback and buying at $435 per share. Mastercard's global payment network continues benefiting from the shift toward digital payments and e-commerce. The company's technology processes billions of transactions annually across more than 210 countries and territories. Beyond its core payment processing business, Mastercard has successfully expanded into value-added services, including cybersecurity, data analytics, and consulting, creating additional revenue streams and strengthening its relationships with financial institutions. Mastercard's investment appeal lies in its powerful network effects, high margins and exposure to global digital payment trends. The company's asset-light business model generates significant free cash flow, allowing for continued investment in technology and strategic acquisitions. Its expansion into emerging markets and new payment technologies, including blockchain and real-time payments, positions it well for future growth. Recent partnerships with fintech companies and investments in open banking capabilities demonstrate Mastercard's commitment to innovation and market expansion. With global digital payment volumes expected to grow at a CAGR of 20% through 2027, Mastercard is well-positioned to capture a significant share of this growth. Eli Lilly has emerged as a leader in innovative therapeutics, particularly in diabetes, obesity and Alzheimer's disease treatments. The company's GLP-1 receptor agonists, including Mounjaro and Zepbound, have demonstrated exceptional efficacy in treating type 2 diabetes and obesity, creating a massive market opportunity. Additionally, its Alzheimer's drug donanemab has shown promising results in clinical trials. Eli Lilly's strong position in the rapidly growing weight loss drug market represents a significant growth driver. Market estimates suggest the obesity market could reach $100 billion by 2030, with Eli Lilly positioned to capture a substantial share. The company's robust pipeline, including potential breakthrough treatments for Alzheimer's and cancer, provides multiple pathways for future growth. The company's consistent investment in R&D, strong patent protection for key drugs, and proven ability to bring innovative treatments to market make it an attractive long-term investment. With healthcare spending expected to grow globally, Eli Lilly's focus on chronic diseases and unmet medical needs positions it well for sustained growth. Costco's membership-based warehouse club model demonstrates remarkable resilience and growth potential. The company's focus on providing high-quality products at competitive prices has created strong customer loyalty, evidenced by its industry-leading membership renewal rates of over 90%. Costco's expansion into e-commerce and international markets provides additional growth opportunities while maintaining its core value proposition. Costco's competitive advantages stem from its efficient operations, strong purchasing power, and loyal customer base. The company's membership model provides predictable recurring revenue, while its reputation for quality and value helps it maintain market share even during economic downturns. Recent investments in digital capabilities and supply chain optimization have improved operational efficiency and customer experience. The company's international expansion plans, particularly in China and other Asian markets, offer significant growth potential. With 29 new warehouse openings planned for fiscal 2025 and continued growth in e-commerce sales, Costco is well-positioned to maintain its growth trajectory while returning value to shareholders through regular dividends and special dividend payments. Bottom Line These five stocks represent compelling investment opportunities for March 2025, offering a mix of growth potential, competitive advantages, and strong fundamentals. While Microsoft and Mastercard provide exposure to digital transformation and financial technology trends, UnitedHealth Group and Eli Lilly offer stakes in healthcare innovation and demographic trends. Costco rounds out the selection with its defensive characteristics and steady growth potential. When making investment decisions, investors should always consider their investment goals, risk tolerance, and portfolio diversification.

Title: A Costco executive on the luxury items its wealthy customers love

Costco (COST+1.20%) is best known for its no-frills, bulk-buying experience, but the warehouse giant also moves a surprising amount of luxury goods. From Rolex watches to gold bars, high-end items have become an integral part of the business, and according to Hamilton “Tony” James, chairman of Costco, wealthier shoppers are hooked. “We’ve known we could move anything in volume if the quality was good and the price was great,” James said in an interview with Chief Executive magazine. That’s partly why the retail giant sells everything from Dom Perignon to 10-karat diamonds. According to James, Costco’s members are not just average-income households – they also include wealthier shoppers who recognize a good deal when they see one, like a Porsche on the sales floor of a Costco in Seattle. Costco, known for its “treasure hunt” shopping experience, won’t sell just anything. Unlike rivals Amazon (AMZN+0.25%) and Walmart (WMT+1.39%), Costco is selective about what it sells. While big-box retailers like Walmart stock over 120,000 different items, Costco limits its selection to about 3,400 stock-keeping units (SKUs). “We’re not interested in selling just anything at a low price,” James said. Instead of offering a $500 TV for $250, Costco would rather sell a $1,000 TV for $500. This formula has been a massive profit boost, further buoyed by the recent surge in gold bar sales. Wells Fargo (WFC+1.54%) noted last year in a research report that the company moved between $100 million and $200 million worth of gold bars each month. James told the magazine he wasn’t sure whether affluent shoppers or those wary of the economy were driving gold bar demand, but either way, the strategy has set Costco apart. He expressed confidence in the company’s position against Amazon and Walmart, noting that Costco focuses on its own approach rather than its competitors’ moves. Walmart-owned Sam’s Club, however, dethroned Costco to claim the top spot in the American Customer Satisfaction Index (ACSI) 2024 rankings for general merchandise retailers. Another area where Costco continues to be an outlier is in its commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). While many corporations, such as Walmart, McDonald’s (MCD-1.06%), and Target (TGT+1.04%), have scaled back on their DEI plans, Costco has held firm.
