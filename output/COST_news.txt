Title: How The King Of Beef Jerky Became A Billionaire

ByChloe Sorvino, Forbes Staff. Back in 1985, the Link family’s Wisconsin meatpacking business had just gone bankrupt, and Jack Link was taking his then-teenage sons hunting when they stopped at a convenience store to buy a few packages of jerky. After paying, Link couldn’t believe how expensive it was. “I said, ‘Wow, that’s quite a lot of money,’” Link, now 79 years old, tells Forbes. The idea stuck with Link, who soon realized that he could make these products himself, and that he even already had ovens in his shutdown plant. “So we laid some jerky in there and it came out just wonderfully,” Link says in a rare interview. “And that's where it all began.” Using his German immigrant great-grandfather’s 1880s recipe, Link’s jerky became a hit, and now as the eponymous brand Jack Link’s, it is the top-selling jerky brand in America. With $2 billion in estimated annual revenue and 34% of the U.S. meat snacks market cornered, the company has made him a billionaire. “The jerky was there all the time to save me,” says Link, who still lives in the same house in Wisconsin where his children grew up. Today, Jack Link’s beef sticks and jerkies are sold across more than 200,000 stores at nearly every major retailer in America, as well as in 55 countries around the world. The business manufactures more than 800 million packages of meat products each year. As the king of the $9 billion (annual sales) global meat snack industry—a hot market that, over the past decade, has attracted an investor-led frenzy of an estimated $1 billion in funding alongside nine-figure acquisitions by large publicly traded companies—Jack Link’s has withstood the challengers, while a few became major flameouts. Throughout this rise, Jack’s younger son, Troy, now 53, has been navigating the path forward, having been named CEO in 2013 as his father moved into a chairman role. Troy Link says the competition is tough but that there is still plenty of room for growth. “Believe it or not, we still have a lot of opportunity,” says Troy. Link Snacks is 100% family-owned, and the Links say they have little interest in selling. If the company did get acquired, it wouldn’t come cheap. Says one private equity investor, “it’s a business you would love to own, but you wouldn't want to buy it based on what the owners think it’s worth.” Forbes estimates the business is conservatively worth $4 billion. Jack Link’s declined to comment on financials. The business has strong profitability—Forbes estimates that gross profit margins top 30%, thanks in part to higher margins at convenience stores and airport newsstands such as Hudson News—and Forbes estimates that it has some $200 million in EBITDA annually. “We can say no to the easy path,” says Troy. “It keeps priorities really straight, and we can stay focused for the long term. “And right now with meat costs soaring, we're able to hold our breath. We're able to let things settle in,” he continues. “They're not going to stay this way forever. The question is, how long can we hold our breath and how purple will our face get?” Jack Link’s has a lot to contend with amid startups growing fast and disrupting shelves—including Chomps, Archer and Fatty Smoked Meat Sticks—but Jack Link’s continues to grow, even at its significant scale. Says Jack, “it's the fortitude and staying at it that make it happen.” When the Links switched from meat packing to jerky-making, Troy had already been working at his family’s Minong, Wisconsin slaughterhouse for a few years, first on the kill floor and then along the de-boning line. “What I learned is you have to continue to reinvent yourself,” he says. After college at University of Wisconsin-Stout, he returned in 1993 to a company that had become profitable and was still growing. Jack Link’s was a popular Midwestern brand, especially at Holiday and Kwik Trip gas stations, that had yet to break out beyond the region. What first took the brand nationwide in the early 1990s was marketing its beef sticks with a cheese stick counterpart. Suddenly, as Troy recalls, the family jerky business had “more orders than we could produce.” With that success, Minong—with a population of around 500—soon became dotted with other Link family businesses, including a car dealership, an RV dealership, a boat dealership, a furniture store, and a grocery store. (The latter three closed a few years ago.) The family has also owned a considerable number of acres of ranch and farmland in the area (and Jack continues to maintain a herd of cattle every year). While Jack led the business, Troy focused on sales, marketing and procuring ingredients. Troy quickly left a major mark on the business when he realized that Jack Link’s should sell bagged beef jerky. “It really wasn’t a thing,” Troy recalls. “No one thought a $5 item could sell.” After pitching the idea to his father, Jack had said that the business didn’t have the capital to back such a launch. But Troy drew up plans to keep costs low. He ultimately convinced Jack to launch four flavors in three sizes and Jack Link’s officially became the first to sell jerky in a bag with a resealable pouch in 1997. Sales soared almost immediately soared as Walmart and Target brought on Jack Link’s. “From the moment we had it, we couldn't produce enough,” Troy recalls. “We couldn't keep it on the shelves.” Today, Jack Link’s bagged beef jerky line makes up more than 50% of total revenue. But the real win was for the business’s bottom line. Previously, Jack Link’s had sold extremely low-cost items—meat sticks for 50 cents or $1 depending on the size—and suddenly each sale was bringing in several dollars at a time. All that incremental profit helped secure the financial foundation, as distribution expanded to Costco and Bass Pro Shops and Jack Link’s pushed further beyond the Midwest. Troy became president in 2003 and the following year, his older brother, Jay, resigned amid several disputes. The Links filed a lawsuit in 2005 to compel Jay to sell his shares, based on a prior agreement, and Jay then filed a countersuit against his father and brother, claiming they breached their fiduciary duty to buy his shares for a discounted price. Both claims eventually went to trial in 2008, and after six weeks in Wisconsin state court, the jury decided that Jay could receive his salary from the day he left the business, but that he had to surrender his shares for the previously determined amount of $19.4 million. The jury also ordered both Jack and his son Jay to each pay $5 million in punitive damages, though Jay’s claim to damages was later slashed by a judge on appeal by more than 80%. Amid that legal chaos, sales soared in 2005 and continued to accelerate quickly. When Troy took over as CEO in 2013, the business had just surpassed $1 billion in estimated annual revenue. It also coincided with the meat snacks industry setting off on a rollercoaster ride. In 2015, Hershey’s acquired high-end jerky brand Krave for $240 million, and then General Mills paid an estimated $100 million for grass-fed bison bar brand Epic Provisions. A boom of interest from private equity and venture investors soon followed. “We've got more competitors and better competitors than ever before,” says Troy. “We've got some competitors that are very focused on having minimal items, and when you have minimal items, you create great velocities.” To stay competitive with brands suddenly backed by publicly traded companies and others flush with private capital, Troy pushed the business to get even bigger, acquiring Unilever’s meat snack division and pushing Jack Link’s into Europe. Jack Link’s sales remained strong, yet Krave floundered at Hershey’s. Krave’s founder Jon Sebastiani bought back the company in 2020 through his private equity investment firm Sonoma Brands and acquired a second jerky line, Chef’s Cut. It took a few years to undo the damage to distribution. But it’s turned around in the past year, especially after Krave, previously only a maker of jerky, launched its first meat stick. Over 2025 Krave and Chef’s Cut increased distribution across a combined 16,000 retail stores, including at Albertsons, Kroger, Costco, Wegmans and H-E-B. Yet another jerky producer, Stryve, which went public through a black check listing in 2021, has nearly imploded. The unprofitable company currently trades as a penny stock. “There's been a lot more people that have come in and failed than people that have come in and succeeded,” says Troy. “Now we have to produce more revenue with less space.” Among the insurgent brands putting pressure on Jack Link’s, there’s Chomps, with $400 million in estimated annual revenue, up nearly 150% year-on-year. Insiders say Chomps could be eyeing going public. Chomps declined to comment on a potential IPO, but claims that more than 22% of the growth in overall meat snack sales nationwide this year was driven by its brand. There’s also Archer with $300 million in estimated 2025 revenue, up over 60% from last year. Revenue could hit $500 million next year, as some 70% of Archer’s sales come from consumers who haven’t purchased a meat snack before or consumers spending more than before. Says Archer founder and CEO Eugene Kang, a member of the Forbes 30 Under 30 class of 2019: “Jack Link’s paved the highway and ultimately there's room for both.” Archer is backed by Monogram Capital, which also acquired the industry’s preferred meat stick contract manufacturer, Western Smokehouse, which makes the sticks for Archer, Chomps, and Fatty, earlier this year in a deal worth about $500 million (including debt). There are also companies backed by publicly traded ConAgra, which owns legacy brand Slim Jim as well as the more recent acquisitions of Thanasi Foods, maker of Duke's meat snacks, in 2017 and Sweetwood Smoke & Co., maker of Fatty, in 2024. Troy says he would like to acquire a few competitor brands himself, but “I keep getting outbid by private equity” he says. Meat snacks, he notes, are “more relevant today than they’ve ever been.” And the sector is still growing. Over the next five years, the industry projects growth of 11% annually. “Everything that you can snack on is a competitor to us,” Troy says. As part of that philosophy, Jack Link’s wants more Gen Z customers and has invested in making beef and turkey sticks as a collaboration with world’s most-watched YouTuber (and a regular Jack Link’s buyer) Jimmy Donaldson, better known as MrBeast. So far, 57% of customers have never purchased a Jack Link’s product before. Growing Jack Link’s meat sticks line will be crucial to winning over new consumers, especially because it’s a faster-growing category than jerky. To that end, Troy wants Jack Link’s to remain relevant, and earlier this year the business sponsored Nascar’s Talladega Speedway and rebranded the Geico 500 as the Jack Link's 500. It will have that name until the end of 2027. Meat sticks are an increasingly important part of Jack Link’s business—so important that the company has invested $450 million (in cash and tax incentives) in building a new 400,000 square feet factory in Perry, Georgia that opened in this year and is dedicated to manufacturing only sticks of meat and cheese. It can make up to 820,000 sticks a day. The new plant is also close to where Troy lives in Florida, where he splits time between Wisconsin. Looking ahead, Troy says Jack Link’s will remain family owned. His wife, Lorissa, runs an allergen-free meat snack brand called Lorissa’s Kitchen, inspired by the youngest of their three children who suffers from allergies. Their children could eventually take on roles at Link Snacks. As for what Jack Link himself hopes the business will look like in another generation or two, he is very clear: “Well, bigger is better.”

December 08, 2025 16:05 ET | Source: Mama’s Creations, Inc. Mama’s Creations, Inc. Revenues Grow 50% YoY to $47.3 Million, Driven by Double-Digit Organic Sales Momentum and Integration of Crown 1 Asset Acquisition EAST RUTHERFORD, NJ, Dec. 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mama’s Creations, Inc. (Nasdaq: MAMA), a leading national marketer and manufacturer of fresh deli prepared foods, has reported its financial results for the third quarter ended October 31, 2025. Financial Summary: Third Quarter Fiscal 2026 & Subsequent Operational Highlights: Management Commentary Adam L. Michaels, Chairman and CEO of Mama’s Creations, said: “Our third quarter demonstrated meaningful momentum in scaling the business. With the integration of the business of Crown 1 underway, we delivered broad-based growth across our protein portfolio, deployed high-return trade and marketing investments, leveraging newly added retail doors and cross-selling. We also implemented targeted price increases across both our beef and chicken portfolios to help offset commodity headwinds, while improvements in chicken operations enhanced throughput and lowered overtime, helping us meet our margin objectives. “With the acquisition of Crown 1’s assets, we began a straightforward integration supported by proximity and shared grill platforms. Crown’s initially lower gross margins weighed on the quarter, but we are executing a clear plan to lift the acquired Bay Shore facility’s margin performance through procurement scale, throughput and overhead efficiencies, shared services, and best-practice sharing – which we expect to lift consolidated corporate gross margins from the low-20% range to the mid-20% range over the next year. “We continue to see strong sales momentum across the portfolio, with Crown opening access to hard-to-penetrate customers and creating new cross-sell channels using its premium product offerings, while expanding SKU penetration across its base remains a core priority. This traction is reinforced by new tier-one wins at Target and Food Lion; at Target, we expect first shipments to begin in February, while our products should hit Food Lion’s shelves this month. This, paired with our ongoing National Costco collaboration, positions us for significant growth in the coming quarters. “As we look ahead, our strategic path toward becoming a $1 billion deli prepared foods company is becoming even clearer. We continue to manage our balance sheet conservatively and maintain strict discipline around capital allocation, prioritizing integration ahead of a new acquisition. With expanded capacity, access to premium retail accounts and ongoing grandma-quality innovation, we are well-positioned to drive sustained profitable growth and improved margins in the quarters to come,” concluded Michaels. Third Quarter Fiscal 2026 Financial Results Revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2026 increased 50.0% to $47.3 million, as compared to $31.5 million in the same year-ago quarter. The increase was attributable to both the acquisition of the Crown 1 business, as well as robust double-digit growth in the core business on a pre-acquisition basis. Gross profit increased 56.6% to $11.1 million, or 23.6% of total revenues, in the third quarter of fiscal 2026, as compared to $7.1 million, or 22.6% of total revenues, in the same year-ago quarter. The increase in gross margin rate was primarily attributable to operational efficiency improvements across the organization and stabilized chicken commodity prices, partially offset by higher beef commodity prices as well as the addition of lower-margin Crown 1 sales, which the Company expects to bring in-line with the corporate average in the mid-20% range over the next year. Operating expenses totaled $10.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2026, as compared to $6.6 million in the same year-ago quarter. As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses increased in the third quarter fiscal 2026 to 21.8% from 20.8%. Operating expenses in the third quarter were impacted by the acquisition of the Crown 1 business, as well as $1.0 million in non-recurring professional fees and transaction expenses related to the acquisition. Excluding the aforementioned acquisition-related expenses, operating expenses remained below 20% of revenue. Net income for the third quarter of fiscal 2026 increased 31.7% to $0.5 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $0.4 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, in the same year-ago quarter. Third quarter net income totaled 1.1% of revenue, as compared to 1.3% in the same year-ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, increased 118.0% to $3.8 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2026, as compared to $1.7 million in the same year-ago quarter. Cash and cash equivalents as of October 31, 2025, grew to $18.1 million, as compared to $7.2 million as of January 31, 2025, primarily driven by improved profitability, ongoing working capital optimization and the private placement completed concurrent with the acquisition of the Crown 1 business. As of October 31, 2025, total debt stood at $6.4 million, as compared to $6.3 million as of October 31, 2024. Conference Call Management will host an investor conference call at 4:30 p.m. Eastern time on Monday, December 8, 2025 to discuss the Company’s third quarter fiscal 2026 financial results, provide a corporate update, and conclude with Q&A from telephone participants.

Title: Yep, Xbox Is Bleeding Out

Reading time 3 minutes Like the worst sort of father, Xbox doesn’t show much care for its youngest consoles anymore, at least judging solely by recent sales data. Black Friday weekend, normally one of the most important for any brand for pre-holiday sales, shows Xbox got beat out by Nintendo, Sony, and—to give the news an ounce of irony—even a relatively obscure Kinect-like console. Mat Piscatella, a video game industry analyst at Circana, reported that the PlayStation 5 accounted for 47% of total Black Friday week console sales, in the U.S. ending Nov. 29. That makes sense, considering the console was on sale for about 40% at some retailers. Sony’s console—both the digital version and one with a disc drive—was on sale for less than even its pre-hike price. Meanwhile, coming up second was the Nintendo Switch 2 at 24% of total sales. The second-generation handheld console was on sale for $50 off the normally $500 Mario Kart World bundle from Walmart and Amazon. Finally, coming in third was the NEX Playground at 14%. See Xbox Series X and S at Amazon In the US, PlayStation 5 accounted for 47% of total Black Friday week hardware unit sales, leading the market. Nintendo Switch 2 ranked 2nd (24%), with the NEX Playground 3rd (14%). Source: Circana Retail Tracking Service [image or embed] — Mat Piscatella (@matpiscatella.bsky.social) December 6, 2025 at 3:37 PM What’s the NEX Playground, you may ask? It’s an Android-based platform made for younger children. It includes motion sensors that can read body movements for games such as Fruit Ninja or tie-in titles like How to Train Your Dragon: Riders of the Skies. Yes, that’s very much like the long-defunct Kinect. It’s a very specific kind of console that may make sense for budget-conscious families. What’s missing from this pie chart is the Xbox Series S and Series X. Microsoft pushed no sales for its consoles during Black Friday week. Even if some retailers went out of their way to move stock with extra gift cards or game sales, Xbox itself wasn’t helping push the needle. The current Xbox Series X costs $650 after this year’s latest price hike. The same console cost $500 at launch in 2020. Piscatella wrote on Bluesky, “Stuff that does not price promote (generally speaking, here) does not see much of a seasonal lift at all from the prior week (usually none).” Since the PS5 was the most heavily discounted, it received the lion’s share of additional sales. Xbox either did not think it was necessary to push sales, or the brand just doesn’t care anymore. Xbox’s whole strategy is now focused on software. If it does finally release a next-gen Xbox, it will likely be a premium, expensive gaming device made for players who want the very best. That means the Xbox Series consoles don’t really have a place anymore. There have been signs that Xbox has been shipping far fewer consoles to retailers, such that Costco removed the company’s consoles from its U.S. and UK websites. The move toward a software-based gaming ecosystem is inevitably disappointing for Xbox fans. At the same time, the cost of RAM and SSD memory blew past the point of reason several weeks ago, and it keeps getting worse. Burgeoning AI data centers are willing to pay so much for memory that semiconductor companies have created a drought of consumer-ready DRAM (dynamic random access memory). The reliable leaker Moore’s Law is Dead reported Sony stockpiled enough memory for the short term, but the RAM shortage could last through 2028. Yes, RAM prices could still be out of control a few years from now. Meanwhile, Xbox’s cloud gaming service has reportedly seen an uptick in total usage hours lately. Whether that means there are more people buying into Game Pass is another question entirely. Microsoft hasn’t been willing to share total subscriber numbers recently. There’s a chance Microsoft’s strategy will win out over the traditionalists like Sony and Nintendo. But for now, its console business is bleeding out so fast, it likely won’t last long.

Title: Stores Beat Robots As Kroger Opts For $350 Million Ocado Pay Off

ByMark Faithfull, Contributor. Maybe the robots aren’t coming for us after all, as grocery retailer Kroger confirmed its retreat from its once-ambitious partnership with fulfillment specialist Ocado. The decision may have delivered a windfall to the U.K. automation specialist but underscores mounting pressures facing the largest traditional grocer in the U.S. as it rethinks how best to serve online customers. Ocado will receive a one-time payment of $350 million from Kroger after the chain decided to shutter three of its automated customer fulfillment centers and curb plans for a broader nationwide rollout. The payout, more generous than initially disclosed, draws a line under a strategy once slated to redefine Kroger’s e-commerce footprint but which has instead become an expensive detour. Kroger disclosed the closures last month as part of a sweeping operational review that revealed its Ocado-powered warehouse network was consistently falling short of internal financial targets. The company said it would book a $2.6 billion impairment, related largely to its new online strategy and asset writedowns at the automated sites. While the grocer emphasized it remains committed to digital growth, the adjustment amounts to an acknowledgment that a system designed to centralize order fulfillment in large, highly automated hubs has not scaled as intended. Instead, Kroger is pivoting back toward fulfilling a greater share of online orders from its extensive store estate, which covers more than 2,700 locations across 35 states. Ocado said Friday that it will continue to operate five active fulfillment centers for Kroger, while a sixth facility in Phoenix is still scheduled to open next year. But a planned site in Charlotte, North Carolina, has been scrapped entirely. The payment, which includes $250 million previously announced, will be made in January and is intended to settle obligations related to the canceled facilities and recalibrate the long-term economics of the partnership. For its part, Ocado reaffirmed its target of turning cash-flow positive in its 2026 fiscal year, insisting it will pursue that goal through a combination of international growth and tighter cost controls. The news prompted a stock price spike for Ocado before it dropped away again, leaving its shares down over 40% on the year. The shift marks a sharp reversal for a partnership that launched in 2018 with the ambition of building up to 20 automated hubs. At the time, Kroger described Ocado’s robotics and routing systems as an opportunity to leapfrog rivals in e-commerce. Early tests appeared promising, but volumes have remained stubbornly below projections, particularly in regions where Kroger’s market share is thinner and where consumer adoption of delivery remains uneven. The economics of large, automated warehouses in the U.S. have struggled to compete with the speed and density advantages of store-based fulfillment, especially as customers have gravitated toward pickup services. The strategic reversal comes as Kroger faces an increasingly complex landscape. The company is navigating a still-uncertain consumer environment marked by persistent inflation in key food categories, heightened price sensitivity and intensifying competition from Walmart, Costco and Amazon. Kroger’s most recent quarterly results showed modest total sales growth but shrinking operating margins, reflecting both promotional pressure and rising labor and logistics costs. The company ended its last fiscal year with roughly $19 billion of long-term debt and has been working to preserve cash ahead of its proposed merger with Albertsons, which remains under regulatory scrutiny. Kroger’s decision to unwind a portion of the Ocado build-out allows it to redirect capital toward areas that offer more predictable returns, including store remodels, private-label expansion and digital loyalty initiatives. For Ocado, Kroger represented the company’s most important international contract, both for scale and for proof-of-concept in the world’s largest grocery market. The recalibration inevitably raises questions about whether Ocado’s capital-intensive technology can justify its cost outside the densest urban areas. Ocado’s leadership has maintained that the U.S. still represents meaningful growth potential and that the exclusivity arrangement with Kroger has not prevented it from continuing discussions with other retailers for future opportunities. Yet the Kroger pullback adds to a string of setbacks. In the U.K., Morrisons said last year it would reduce its reliance on Ocado’s centralized warehouses and shift more online fulfillment back to its stores, using Ocado’s in-store picking software rather than the full automation suite. Other global partners, including Aeon in Japan, Casino in France, Coles in Australia and Sobeys in Canada, continue to build out Ocado-powered facilities, but none offers the scale or symbolic significance that a full U.S. rollout would have provided. In the U.S., Ocado’s challenges have been amplified by a market that is fragmented, logistically complex and increasingly dominated by retailers with vertically integrated fulfillment networks. Amazon continues to invest heavily in same-day nodes that are tightly aligned with its Whole Foods and Amazon Fresh operations, despite ongoing issues in the grocery market. Meantime, Walmart has leaned on its vast store base to create a hybrid fulfillment model that has proved both flexible and cost-effective. For Kroger, the priority now is stabilizing its digital economics. While online grocery sales for the company have grown significantly over recent years, profitability remains elusive. The grocer believes that shifting more fulfillment back into stores will allow it to use existing labor and inventory more flexibly, reduce delivery distances and improve order cycle times. The company has also been experimenting with smaller, regionally-dispersed delivery spokes designed to support store-based fulfillment without the cost of an Ocado hub. And that means that for Ocado the challenge now is to show that its model can prevail even when Kroger, one of its most important partners has decided that scale, at least for now, is better achieved through stores that are closer to customers and cheaper to operate than a warehouse full of robots.
