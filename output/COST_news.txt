Title: Thinking about Getting a Costco Membership? Here's How Much You Can Save

Reviews ethics statement Costco offers deals on bulk groceries, home essentials and more. But exactly how much can you save? I did the math. A Costco membership can save you more than $1,000 yearly in groceries alone. Groceries are the biggest ongoing expense for most families after housing, and they've seen an annoying uptick since the pandemic and all its supply chain chaos. In fact, the price of food rose 25% from 2019 to 2023, according to the US Department of Agriculture. One way to combat high supermarket prices is buying in bulk and nowhere is that more easily done that at Costco -- if you have one in your town or city. At Costco, groceries are packaged in larger quantities and sold at cheaper per-pound prices, meaning you can save major dough as long as you have the space to store a 50-pack of paper towels or a 20-pound bag of rice. Shopping at Costco also typically means fewer trips to the store, which translates to less gas. To see exactly how much money you can save by buying bulk groceries from Costco, I decided to price out a grocery list at the wholesale club and a more typical grocery store. After running the numbers, it's possible to save over $1,000 in one year by shopping at Costco instead of a supermarket. Below is a breakdown of how I reached that figure. (And if you get a Costco Executive membership, you could save even more.) Using grocery list templates available online, I assembled a list of 25 typical, staple grocery items that are suitable for longer storage, either in the pantry, refrigerator or freezer. This ruled out most fresh produce with some exceptions. If you're hosting a large gathering, buying produce in bulk may be worthwhile. Bulk shopping doesn't mean buying a year's worth of groceries all at once, but I didn't include anything that wouldn't hold up well for at least a month, with the notion that bulk grocery shopping can be done less often. Bulk buying also requires spending more upfront, which is why Costco's per-item total is considerably higher than Stop & Shop's. Assuming either bi-weekly or monthly consumption of those staple grocery items for a household of one or two people, I came up with the approximate yearly consumption for each. I chose Stop & Shop to represent a conventional grocery retailer, as it's largely considered to be a quality store with median prices, and Costco to represent bulk buying, as its Kirkland Signature products have a bit of a following in their own right -- Costco is the Trader Joe's of the bulk set, for sure. Unless a national brand is otherwise indicated, I used Stop & Shop's SB brand, or the least expensive name-brand product for a given item, to compare to Costco's Kirkland Signature brand. For the Stop & Shop items, coming up with the yearly price for each item was a simple matter of multiplying by 26 for bi-weekly consumption, or 12 for monthly consumption. For Costco's items, I scaled the prices accordingly based on whatever package size Costco offers to indicate a yearly cost for the same amount of a given item. If you can afford the freezer space, buying meat in bulk will save you big money over the course of a year. Since I was primarily interested in food cost savings, I didn't factor in cleaning supplies, paper products or other items, but you can safely assume these also amount to big saving potential over the year when bought in bulk. Also, since my calculations were based on a small household, the bigger your household, the bigger the savings. Costco requires a membership to take advantage of its bulk savings and low-cost signature brands. A basic membership costs $65 a year and is valid at all locations. Read more about the different Costco membership options. The economics of buying in bulk is simple: The more you buy of something at one time, the less it costs per count or unit of weight. Producers, distributors and retailers are able to offer lower prices this way not only because bulk items often require less packaging, but also because for them it's a sure sale over a potential sale -- they'd rather have your money now, even at a discount, than parsed out over a period of time. Shelf-stable items including cereal, sauces and coffee make up some of the biggest savings when buying in bulk. Given this particular grocery list, buying in bulk would allow you to save over $1,000 during the course of a year, representing a 33% savings overall over conventional groceries. (In today's economy, it is worth mentioning that you also save gas money with fewer trips to the store.) In a few cases, the Stop & Shop item ended up being the cheaper option: organic milk, carrots, potatoes and frozen salmon filets, for example. In all of these cases, there wasn't a huge size difference between the conventional and bulk items. Milk is an especially good example, as it's still offered in a larger quantity at Costco, but there's only so much of it you can buy at one time without risking it spoiling, and so the bulk offering is comparatively modest. Costco also doesn't have a Kirkland brand offering of organic milk, whereas Stop & Shop does. The savings for bulk fresh produce were not as significant as pantry staples and shelf-stable groceries. Generally speaking, the larger the scale on the bulk item, the larger the savings. If you buy a 40-ounce quantity of Cheerios, for example, rather than the 12 ounces you get in a typical box, they become nearly 75% cheaper. Buying 25 pounds of white rice all at once instead of 2 pounds at a time saves you 60%. With at least a grand in savings available yearly for just a portion of your grocery list, even if you need to buy additional home storage to accommodate it, the verdict is clear: Bulk grocery shopping is well worth the effort. Some of the biggest savings by percentage come from shelf-stable and pantry items including chips, crackers, jarred sauce, rice and whole-bean coffee. These items are typically easier to store and less likely to spoil or deteriorate in quality. Buying pantry items in bulk from a discount grocer such as Costco represents a clear and risk-free strategy for saving money on your grocery bill over the course of a year.
