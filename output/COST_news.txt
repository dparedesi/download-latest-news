Today’s 9to5Toys Lunch Break is loaded with some big-time Apple price drops. Firstly, the all-time lows at $250 off across the M4 MacBook Air lineup have now returned, and we are now tracking a new Amazon all-time low on the most affordable M5 MacBook Pro at nearly $120 off. Those offers also join the best prices to date on Apple Watch Ultra 3 Alpine and Trail configs as well as all-time low pricing on the most affordable new Midnight Apple Watch SE 3 at $200. All of that is detailed for you below alongside this $300 price drop Apple’s Space Black 1TB M4 iPad Pro cell model. Deals on Apple’s latest MacBook releases are really starting to heat up as part of the early Black Friday festivities. All of the M4 MacBook Air models have now dropped back down to the lowest prices ever, we caught an upgraded M5 MacBook Pro at a new all-time low yesterday, and Amazon just served up the lowest price to date on the most affordable new M5 MacBook Pro at nearly $120 off. Amazon is now offering the 14-inch Space Black M5 MacBook Prowith 16GB of RAM and the 512GB SSD down at $1,481 shipped. Regularly $1,599, this is a new Amazon all-time low and the best price we have tracked yet in new condition with $118 slashed from the list. We recently featured a series of exclusive discounts on Apple’s brand new M5 machine – most of those offers remain the lowest prices we have seen to date, but Amazon has now picked it up a notch to deliver the lowest prices anywhere on the new 16GB models, including both the 512GB and 1TB storage options: We caught some early and quite impressive $99 price drops on the brand new Apple Watch Ultra 3 as part of the major early Black Friday offers. At the time that was largely just for Costco members or only on the new Ocean Band configurations elsewhere, but this morning Amazon has put a number of the Alpine and Trail Loop at $99 off as well. Amazon is still offering the same price drops we featured previously on the Ocean Band models, but you will now find a selection of the Apple Watch Ultra 3 configswith the new 2025 Alpine Loop and Trail Loops marked down to $699.99 shipped – a new Amazon all-time low price at $99 under the regular $799 list price. As you can see in the list above, we are also adding the Natural Apple Watch Ultra 3 with the matching Natural Titanium Milanese Loop to the list as well. This one, as you likely already know, fetches a premium because of the higher-end metal Milanese Loop, but it is also now $99 off and sitting at the best price we have ever tracked on Amazon. While not a perfect comparison because it was effectively just a new black color last year, the best official deal we tracked on Apple Watch Ultra 2 (currently down at $650) for Black Friday 2024 was the $80 price drop ushered in by Best Buy’s Black Friday Doorbusters and over at Amazon. We could see the series 3 go for less, but landing Apple’s brand new flagship wearable at nearly $100 off is certainly a solid price drop this soon after release. We caught our very first deal on Apple’s new Midnight 44mm Midnight SE 3 wearable the other day. It went completely out of stock before making a return yesterday – it is still live at the moment – and now the most affordable Midnight model in the new collection is live at its $199.99 all-time low. Amazon is now offering the 40mm Apple Watch SE 3 in the Midnight colorway down at $199.99 shipped. Regularly $249, this is nearly $49 off and the best price we have ever tracked. While this one did drop to the same $200 we have here now at a few days ago, it almost immediately went out of stock and remained unavailable until this morning. Considering almost no one had a chance at this deal earlier in the week, today’s offer is effectively the first chance to score a notable price drop on the most affordable Midnight Apple Watch SE 3 – the most affordable 2025 Apple Watch – and a new Amazon all-time low. This year’s new Apple Watch SE model is the most compelling model Apple has ever released if you ask me. It is, by and large, for just about anyone but the most hardcore users, effectively an Apple Watch Series 10 with less color options. It runs on the same S10 chip and finally supports an always-on display (a must-have for me) as well as double-tap and wrist-flick gesture support. It’s clearly not a Series-grade Apple Watch, but starting at $200 it’s awfully close and much more affordable – the most affordable Series 11 starts at $389 on Amazon. Amazon is landing this morning with one of the best discounts we have ever tracked on the iPhone 16 Pro Max. While we have seen a countless number of opportunities to save big on iPhone 16 Pro configurations, particularly deep 16 Pro Max offers have been a little bit harder to come by. However, this morning you’ll find the 1TB Black Titanium model at $540 off the original list price. Amazon is now offering the Black Titanium 1TB iPhone 16 Pro Max down at $1,059 shipped in Renewed Premium condition with a 1-year warranty and a 90-day return guarantee. You’re looking at a spec’d out, upgraded iPhone 16 Pro Max that released in late 2024 at $1,599. While Apple no longer sells this model, as it has been replaced by the 17 Pro Max for the same price, this is indeed $540 off the price you would have paid for it straight from Apple not more than a couple months ago. And all things considered, if it has taken this long for Amazon to serve up an all-time low price on the 16 Pro, you might be waiting until this time next year to see the same on the 17 Pro/Max. The $1,059 asking price here might seem like a lot for a renewed iPhone, but this is the highest-quality refurb Amazon offers and one of the best sources for relatively new iPhone deals there is. I might even suggest it is the best way to land an unlocked iPhone 16 Pro/Max anywhere, even if you have the cash to buy a brand new unit. For more insight on what Apple’s latest handset releases deliver, here’s our hands-on review of the new iPhone 17 Pro. With all of the new M5 talk and fancy new Apple Watch releases, and the all-new AirPods Pro 3, never mind the all-time low pricing on M4 MacBook Air models, one of the best and most value-packed current-generation machines might be slipping under your radar – M4 Mac mini. I have been raving about this machine for a long while now, and with early Black Friday pricing now live, and our recent follow-up video review after 1 year in the lab, we wanted to make sure these deals are front and center. There’s no denying how convenient a MacBook can be – it is effectively just as good a home office computer as it is a portable solution – but it’s going to cost you a whole lot more than the Mac mini. And while I certainly value the freedom Apple’s battery-powered Macs provide, the M4 Mac mini has been the best and most useful Apple purchase I have made in recent memory. If you need to be able to pick up and go with your Mac system, then the Mac mini clearly isn’t for you, but if you don’t or you’re just looking to land a solid new at-home setup without completely running up the credit card, there’s simply nothing better if you ask me. You can get the same on-screen macOS experience as the MacBook for $250 less than the most affordable current-generation MacBook, and that’s with the all-time low Black Friday pricing right now.
