Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Alex Wong / Getty Images News via Getty Images This is the next in our series on the worst CEOs in America. There will be an all-time winner later in the year. These chief executives were picked based on their major strategy stumbles, as well as how decisions they made affected shareholders, customers, and employees. Some of these CEOs are fairly new to the public corporations they run. Others have had their jobs for years. It is a good thing for investors that they will not have Target Corp. (NYSE: TGT) CEO Brian Cornell to kick around anymore. He has taken the retailer through a ruinous period. He took the job in 2014. The Target board showed remarkably bad judgment and kept Cornell on as executive board chair. In a second shocking development, the board made Michael Fiddelke, current chief operating officer, the new CEO as of February 1, 2026. As Cornell ruined Target, Fiddelke helped him. When the board announced the decision, Neil Saunders of GlobalData commented, “The biggest mistake is actually keeping Brian Cornell on the board and making him the chair. It’s just ludicrous. You’re rewarding failure, and everybody at Target knows that.” jeepersmedia / Flickr Target’s stock performance has been horrible. Over the past five years, it is down 49% while the market is up 88%. In the past year, it is down 30% as the market has risen 15%. Year to date, the figures are about the same. By way of comparison, Walmart Inc. (NYSE: WMT) stock is up 118% in the past five years and Costco Wholesale Corp. (NASDAQ: COST) 135% higher. Target has been dogged quarter after quarter by bad earnings. In the most recently reported quarter, net sales fell 1.5% to $25.3 billion. Earnings decreased 18.2% to $1.52 per share. For the first three quarters of the year, the figures were just as poor. Revenue fell 1.7% to $74.3 billion, and earnings dropped 9.6% to $5.85 per share. According to Yahoo Finance, of 38 analysts who follow Target, 28 rate it as Sell or Hold. Their average price target is $96.52, barely up from the current price of $90.62. As Morningstar pointed out, “Though the 2026 leadership transition from CEO Brian Cornell (after 11 years at the helm) to COO Michael Fiddelke (a 20-year veteran of the business) could incite change, we’re skeptical it will be meaningful enough to regain lost market share or materially shift Target’s competitive standing given his long tenure at the retailer.” It may be that the largest single insult to Target shareholders is that Cornell made $20,407,603 in 2024. The insult to employees is that he made 753 times their median compensation. During the period when Cornell was CEO, everyone lost but him.

Cyber Monday 2025 Absolute Best Deals Deals Under $100 Laptop Deals Kindle Deals Apple Deals Tech Deals Headphone Deals Sleep Deals Phone Deals Coffee Deals Smart Birdfeeder Deals If you're a Costco member, you're no stranger to a nice discount, it's one of the things that makes that $65 per year worth the cost. Even so, Costco tends to go all out for Cyber Monday, luring members into the warehouse with the sweet smell of discounts on game consoles, kitchen gadgets, and computers, not to mention $1.50 hot dogs. I've scoured the ads and circled some of the WIRED gear team's favorite stuff for you, leading you straight to savings that would make even the biggest Kirkland doubter jealous. The discounts below are available now, though availability between online delivery and in-warehouse sales may be a little different depending on your location. For more great discounts, check out our Best Cyber Monday Deals roundup and all of our deals coverage here. KitchenAid KitchenAid Amazon Shop at Crate & Barrel You're likely to find a Kitchen-Aid Stand Mixer on the counter of almost any serious home chef, and for good reason. The renowned reliability and consistency has earned it a spot on our list of products you can buy for life, and mine has earned a permanent spot on on my counter, despite limited space. You can pick up the mixer, a 6-quart bowl, four attachments, and a pouring shield, for just $320, a $100 break off of Costco's usual price. Costco frequently discounts the heftier bowl-lift version, which I find useful for squeezing under my low cabinets, but this Cyber Monday deal is particularly juicy. There are three colors available, and while mine at home is the classic silver, if I had to do it again I'd go with the matte black. Ninja Amazon Crate & Barrel WIRED writer Matthew Korfhage is a big fan of the Ninja Slushi, a delightful drink maker for stirring up smoothies and margaritas at home. Just a few days ago, he spotted it on sale for $270, and it's not a competition, but Costco members can save an additional $20 on a special 96-oz version that includes two insulated cups with bubble tops. This compact machine makes drinks, keeps them frozen for 12 hours, and has easy machine-washable parts so nothing gets too sticky in between parties. Dyson Best Buy Amazon (V15 Detect) Amazon (V15 Detect Plus) Dyson The excellent Dyson V15 Detect is one of our favorite stick vacuums, and it's deeply discounted to just $500 at Costco, beating both Amazon and Best Buy by $50 while still including a suite of 10 accessories. The Detect naming comes from this vacuum's special trick, which analyzes the dust in front of it and adjusts your power to suit the mess. Is that a bit over-engineered for a stick vacuum? Maybe. But the results are hard to argue with, and it's one of our favorite Dyson vacuums for good reason. Apple Amazon (15-inch) Best Buy (13-inch) Apple Amazon (13-inch) If you're feeling more portable, you can also snag an Apple MacBook Air from Costco for just $750. It features similar specs to the Mac Mini above, with a 10-core M4 processor, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD. Reviewer Brenda Stolyar really liked this version of the machine, which pairs snappy performance with a smart screen and great battery life, and it's really only held back by limited ports and some heat management issues. Unlike the other sales, this one is only available until it sells out. Apple Amazon Best Buy Apple The compact Mac Mini from 2024 may be slightly dated, but it's still an excellent buy, especially with the Cyber Monday discount Costco has running, which brings the price down to just $480. It's fairly well equipped for its generation, with 16GB of memory, 256GB of SSD storage, and the 10-core Apple M4 processor, making it one of the least expensive devices with support for Apple Intelligence features. Sony Best Buy Walmart Amazon If you've been looking to upgrade your gaming setup ahead of those cold winter months, Costco has the Sony PlayStation 5 and an extra DualSense wireless controller for just $480. Considering the controllers run anywhere from $50-75 on their own, you're getting a noticeable discount on the console on top of being able to play with a friend. Bose Amazon B&H Bose They may be fresh on the market, but that won't stop Costco from knocking $50 off the Bose QuietComfort Ultra 2. WIRED writer Ryan Waniata recently got to spend some time with the sequel to one of our favorite noise-canceling headphones, and despite only minor upgrades, they still manage to improve the formula with new convenience features and the same great comfort and sound. Sonos Amazon Walmart The Sonos Arc Ultra is our favorite sound bar for standalone Dolby Atmos support, and Costco has it marked down to $880, just a dollar higher than Amazon's current price. Our reviewer Ryan Waniata was extremely impressed with the expansive soundstage, profound bass, and excellent clarity. It's also helped along by the updated mobile app, which has improved drastically over the last few iterations, and is particularly smart if you're already in the Sonos ecosystem.

When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. Cyber Monday is here, and there are lots of deals to choose from, including these excellent discounts on the Apple products we recommend: Today’s best Apple deals: U.S. Today’s best Apple deals: U.K. Updated December 1: We have reviewed the best prices and found more price drops and changes. We will be regularly monitoring the best prices and will update this article throughout Cyber Monday. ‘Tis the season for savings! Whether you’re looking for a deal on an iPad, Mac, iPhone, Apple Watch, AirPods, or anything else Apple sells, there’s no better time to get one for cheap than Black Friday. The annual shopping extravaganza officially kicked off on Friday, but many of the best deals will last until today, AKA Cyber Monday on December 1. Every retailer that sells Apple gear gets in on the fun, and we are rounding up only the best deals we find right here. We regularly check prices using various tools to get a view of the very best prices right now, compared to what they were over the past days, weeks, and months, so we know an excellent deal when we see it. We’re checking and updating these prices all weekend, so mark this page and return often so you don’t miss a good deal, some of which are short-lived. Even Apple runs its own Black Friday shopping event, where it offers gift cards on certain purchases, including $50 with AirPods Pro 3, $100 for iPad Air, and $250 with a MacBook Pro. The bottom line is that there are lots of deals to be found right now, so no matter what Apple device you’re looking for, you will be able to make a saving. So take a look at the deals on all of Apple’s products below. Also, check our Best Picks round-ups, where you can find reviews of all the products we recommend. At Macworld we’ve been covering and reviewing Apple and Apple devices for more than 40 years, from the original Macintosh to the most recent M5 MacBook Pro and iPhone 17 lineup. We use Apple products every day and purchase them with our own money, so we know a good deal when we see one. More importantly, we also know how to spot a bad deal. With a working knowledge of everything Apple sells and decades of experience, we know when stores are inflating prices or pushing “normal” sales as limited Black Friday deals, so the listings you see here will only be for discounts that are at or near all-time low prices. Macworld Cyber Monday tip: While shopping during the Black Friday sales, we’ve noticed that on Amazon, if you delay your delivery date, there are additional 2-3% savings to be had. This doesn’t apply to every Apple product, unfortunately, but we have seen the additional 3% applied to AirTags, and if you have lots of other eligible products in your shopping cart, then it can add up to decent savings. Apple released the new M5 MacBook Pro in October, but still sells M4 Pro and M4 Max models as well as the M4 MacBook Air. The new M5 model is mostly a chip refresh, but it’s a great one, as we said in our 4.5-star review, and right now you can get $250 off all the 14-inch M5 MacBook Pro at Amazon, taking it $50 lower than last Thursday and down to the lowest price we have seen. However, even though the new model brings a major boost in GPU and SSD performance, we also loved the M4 model, and you can get an amazing $300 off the M4 MacBook Pro at Amazon. There are also some excellent deals on the even more powerful MacBook Pro M4 Pro and M4 Max, which are full on workstations now at amazingly low prices, such as $300 off the 14-inch M4 Pro MacBook Pro at Amazon, and a whopping $500 off the 16-inch M4 Max MacBook Pro, also at Amazon. You can find more deals below. And, of course, the MacBook Air is a fantastic option for just about anyone, earning an extremely rare 5-star score in our testing. You can get $250 off the MacBook Air at Amazon. U.K. shoppers don’t miss out either, with £184 off a 13-inch MacBook Air at Amazon. £200 off the M5 MacBook Pro at KRCS, and £349 off the M4 Pro MacBook Pro at Amazon. See even more great deals below. Foundry U.S. U.K. The iMac and Mac mini received an M4 update in October 2024, with the Mac mini also getting a dramatic redesign that shrunk the case down to just 5 inches. We loved the new Mac mini design and M4 chip and there is $120 off at Amazon. The Mac mini M4 Pro version is a great low-cost way to get a really powerful Mac, and with $150 off it’s a good saving (but it was $200 earlier in the Black Friday sale). We don’t know when they will be getting M5 chips, but if they are, they won’t arrive until 2026, so we recommend picking up one of these deals if you’re looking for a Mac desktop. U.K. users should take advantage of £100 off the Mac mini, and £130 off the Mac mini pro. Simon Jary / Foundry U.S. U.K. Apple released the AirPods Pro 3 in September 2025, with a slightly new design, foam-infused eartips, and a heart-rate sensor. We gave them a near-perfect score in our review, but also noted that it’s a relatively small upgrade over the AirPods Pro 2, which has the same H2 chip and many similar features. The new model has the same $249 MSRP in the U.S. and a slightly lower £219 RRP in the U.K. (AirPods Pro 2 were £229), so keep that in mind when shopping. We don’t expect to see AirPods Pro 3 with more than $30-$50 off, but the older AirPods Pro 2 did dip as low as $139 at Walmart, but that deal seems to have ended now, the next best option is $189 on Amazon. The AirPods 4 have been out for over a year, but are still a fantastic pair of earbuds. The Black Friday deals of $69 for AirPods 4 was superb, but stock seems to have run out now (check to see if the model is user). You can still get AirPods 4 with active noise cancellation for less than $100, which is an excellent deal. If you need a pair, grab one, just beware that AirPods deals sell out quickly, but do keep checking because stock seems to come and go. See more U.S. AirPods deals below. U.K. readers can save money on the AirPods Pro 2, currently at £169 with Argos, but we’ve also seen them at that price on Amazon (but they go out of stock quickly!). Right now you can also get £20 off the AirPods 4, bringing the price under £100. See more U.K. AirPods deals below. Petter Ahrnstedt U.S. U.K. Mike Sawh Apple launched the Apple Watch Series 11 in September, but there aren’t many exclusive new features beyond better battery life and 5G networking. The two new health features, hypertension alerts and Sleep Score, are also available on the Series 10, and there isn’t a new color this year. As we noted in our review, we don’t think Series 9 or 10 users need to upgrade. We are seeing savings of $60 on the Series 11, which is a great price for such a full-featured watch, but with $150 off the Series 10 you might want to consider that, you won’t miss out on much (See our comparison of every Apple Watch). The sleeper hit of the new Apple Watch lineup is the SE 3, which got the biggest update of all three models, gaining an always-on display, temperature sensor, a faster chip, on-device Siri, and fast charging. We gave it a near-perfect score of 4.5 stars and highly recommend it at full price—for $50 off, it’s a no-brainer decision. At the high end, the Ultra 3 has a slightly larger screen, satellite connectivity, and longer battery life compared to last year’s model. We’ve seen $150 off, but if you want one, we’d recommend this $599 deal on the Ultra 2 instead. U.S. U.K. In the U.K. the deals are small on the newest Apple Watch models, but we anticipate that they will improve once Black Friday is here. And if they don’t our advice would be to snap up Apple’s offer, which will get you a £40 gift card. The biggest deals on offer right now are on the older models. We’d recommend Argos’s £200 off the Apple Watch Ultra 2 and Curry’s £130 off the Apple Watch Series 10. Just keep in mind that in the U.K., Apple cut the Apple Watch Series 11 and Ultra 3 prices by £30 and £50 compared to the previous generation when they were introduced. Keep this in mind when shopping, because some stores might make savings appear to be larger than they actually are. Apple updated the iPad Air with an M3 chip and the iPad Pro with an M5 chip this year. Neither update brings any huge reason to upgrade, but they’re both excellent tablets. It comes down to preference and budget—if you’re largely using your tablet for consumption (streaming, surfing, games), get an Air, for which we are seeing prices cut by $150, but if you have real work to do on it, get the Pro: you can get $100 off the M5 iPad Pro in the U.S. which is a great deal on such a new device. The mini hasn’t had a meaningful update in a couple of generations. But as we noted in our review, it’s still the best tablet for its size and a great option for anyone who values ultra portability over screen size. There’s a decent $100 off. The standard entry-level iPad A16 is an absolute steal at its Black Friday price of $275, but stock is dwindling, so if you want one act fast. Foundry U.S. U.K. We’re seeing a great £100 saving on the iPad Air, but the deals on the other iPads in the U.K. aren’t as big as they are in the U.S. The M5 iPad Pro only has a small saving, so right now we are looking at the older models to get a better discount. With that in mind, we’d recommend the M4 iPad Pro if you can find one (it’s £206 off at Amazon, but selling out fast). Apple has a great deal on for Black Friday that will run through to December 1, 2025. You can subscribe for six months for just $5.99/£4.99 a month! That’s half price! Read more here: Get Apple TV for just $6 per month. David Price / Foundry Most iPhone deals in the U.S. are through carriers and require a trade-in or adding a new line. Carriers will likely have enticing deals with trade-ins as well, but be wary of long-term contracts and terms. One opportunity worth considering is Apple’s Black Friday deal: You can buy an iPhone from Apple and get a gift voucher: In the U.K. there are less limitations on the sale of iPhones so you will be able to pick one up unlocked at a discount if you would prefer to buy an iPhone up front, rather than on a contract. Apple only launched the iPhone 17 lineup in September, so it’s a surprise that we are seeing £100 off the iPhone Air. The iPhone 16e also has £100 off at Amazon: a good saving. Also be on the look out for deals (like this one from AO) on the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max which are no longer sold by Apple but would offer a good option to those who appreciate the extra camera on the Pro iPhone models but can’t stretch to the iPhone 17 Pro. We’d suggest that when it comes to the other deals you should weigh them up against Apple’s own giveaway, where you could get £60 or £40 vouchers with the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, or iPhone 16e, respectively. For example, £100 off an iPhone 16e is better than Apple’s £40 voucher, but AO’s £55 off iPhone 16 (128GB) (which has run out now) doesn’t match Apple’s £60 voucher deal so it would be worth waiting to see it that goes lower. These are the best deals we’ve seen so far: There are lots more Apple products you can buy to go with your new Mac, iPhone, or iPad. Whether it’s a mouse and keyboard for your Mac, an Apple Pencil or keyboard cover to go with your iPad, charging cables and adapters, we are keeping track of everything so you can grab a discount this Cyber Monday. It’s a great time to grab a pack of AirTags, with prices dropping to $65 or £74 for a pack of four of Apple’s tracking devices. And we are seeing some nice price cuts on Apple Pencils (just make sure they work with your iPad first). The Apple Pencil Pro ($34 off/£20 off) is the newest model and is compatible with the iPad Pro, iPad Air, and iPad mini. Thiago Trevisan/Foundry U.S. U.K. If it doesn’t have to be AirPods, take a look at these deals on Apple owned subsidiary Beats. You might also find some deals among our best earbuds for iPhones and Best over-ear headphones. U.S. U.K. Apple holds a shopping event every Black Friday, but it doesn’t offer actual discounts. Instead, Apple gives away gift cards when you buy certain products, which can be used on a future purchase. In 2025, Apple is offering the following gift card values over Black Friday weekend: This years deal is better than last year’s, with a maximum of $250/£200 being given away in the form of gift vouchers, and in some cases, such as the iPhones, we are seeing better savings via Apple than elsewhere.

Macworld Cyber Monday tip: While shopping during the Black Friday sales, we’ve noticed that on Amazon, if you delay your delivery date, there are additional 2-3% savings to be had. This doesn’t apply to every Apple product, unfortunately, but we have seen the additional 3% applied to AirTags, and if you have lots of other eligible products in your shopping cart, then it can add up to decent savings. Apple released the new M5 MacBook Pro in October, but still sells M4 Pro and M4 Max models as well as the M4 MacBook Air. The new M5 model is mostly a chip refresh, but it’s a great one, as we said in our 4.5-star review, and right now you can get $250 off all the 14-inch M5 MacBook Pro at Amazon, taking it $50 lower than last Thursday and down to the lowest price we have seen. However, even though the new model brings a major boost in GPU and SSD performance, we also loved the M4 model, and you can get an amazing $300 off the M4 MacBook Pro at Amazon. There are also some excellent deals on the even more powerful MacBook Pro M4 Pro and M4 Max, which are full on workstations now at amazingly low prices, such as $300 off the 14-inch M4 Pro MacBook Pro at Amazon, and a whopping $500 off the 16-inch M4 Max MacBook Pro, also at Amazon. You can find more deals below. And, of course, the MacBook Air is a fantastic option for just about anyone, earning an extremely rare 5-star score in our testing. You can get $250 off the MacBook Air at Amazon. U.K. shoppers don’t miss out either, with £184 off a 13-inch MacBook Air at Amazon. £200 off the M5 MacBook Pro at KRCS, and £349 off the M4 Pro MacBook Pro at Amazon. See even more great deals below. Foundry U.S. U.K. The iMac and Mac mini received an M4 update in October 2024, with the Mac mini also getting a dramatic redesign that shrunk the case down to just 5 inches. We loved the new Mac mini design and M4 chip and there is $120 off at Amazon. The Mac mini M4 Pro version is a great low-cost way to get a really powerful Mac, and with $150 off it’s a good saving (but it was $200 earlier in the Black Friday sale). We don’t know when they will be getting M5 chips, but if they are, they won’t arrive until 2026, so we recommend picking up one of these deals if you’re looking for a Mac desktop. U.K. users should take advantage of £100 off the Mac mini, and £130 off the Mac mini pro. Simon Jary / Foundry U.S. U.K. Apple released the AirPods Pro 3 in September 2025, with a slightly new design, foam-infused eartips, and a heart-rate sensor. We gave them a near-perfect score in our review, but also noted that it’s a relatively small upgrade over the AirPods Pro 2, which has the same H2 chip and many similar features. The new model has the same $249 MSRP in the U.S. and a slightly lower £219 RRP in the U.K. (AirPods Pro 2 were £229), so keep that in mind when shopping. We don’t expect to see AirPods Pro 3 with more than $30-$50 off, but the older AirPods Pro 2 did dip as low as $139 at Walmart, but that deal seems to have ended now, the next best option is $189 on Amazon. The AirPods 4 have been out for over a year, but are still a fantastic pair of earbuds. The Black Friday deals of $69 for AirPods 4 was superb, but stock seems to have run out now (check to see if the model is user). You can still get AirPods 4 with active noise cancellation for less than $100, which is an excellent deal. If you need a pair, grab one, just beware that AirPods deals sell out quickly, but do keep checking because stock seems to come and go. See more U.S. AirPods deals below. U.K. readers can save money on the AirPods Pro 2, currently at £169 with Argos, but we’ve also seen them at that price on Amazon (but they go out of stock quickly!). Right now you can also get £20 off the AirPods 4, bringing the price under £100. See more U.K. AirPods deals below. Petter Ahrnstedt U.S. U.K. Mike Sawh Apple launched the Apple Watch Series 11 in September, but there aren’t many exclusive new features beyond better battery life and 5G networking. The two new health features, hypertension alerts and Sleep Score, are also available on the Series 10, and there isn’t a new color this year. As we noted in our review, we don’t think Series 9 or 10 users need to upgrade. We are seeing savings of $60 on the Series 11, which is a great price for such a full-featured watch, but with $150 off the Series 10 you might want to consider that, you won’t miss out on much (See our comparison of every Apple Watch). The sleeper hit of the new Apple Watch lineup is the SE 3, which got the biggest update of all three models, gaining an always-on display, temperature sensor, a faster chip, on-device Siri, and fast charging. We gave it a near-perfect score of 4.5 stars and highly recommend it at full price—for $50 off, it’s a no-brainer decision. At the high end, the Ultra 3 has a slightly larger screen, satellite connectivity, and longer battery life compared to last year’s model. We’ve seen $150 off, but if you want one, we’d recommend this $599 deal on the Ultra 2 instead. U.S. U.K. In the U.K. the deals are small on the newest Apple Watch models, but we anticipate that they will improve once Black Friday is here. And if they don’t our advice would be to snap up Apple’s offer, which will get you a £40 gift card. The biggest deals on offer right now are on the older models. We’d recommend Argos’s £200 off the Apple Watch Ultra 2 and Curry’s £130 off the Apple Watch Series 10. Just keep in mind that in the U.K., Apple cut the Apple Watch Series 11 and Ultra 3 prices by £30 and £50 compared to the previous generation when they were introduced. Keep this in mind when shopping, because some stores might make savings appear to be larger than they actually are. Apple updated the iPad Air with an M3 chip and the iPad Pro with an M5 chip this year. Neither update brings any huge reason to upgrade, but they’re both excellent tablets. It comes down to preference and budget—if you’re largely using your tablet for consumption (streaming, surfing, games), get an Air, for which we are seeing prices cut by $150, but if you have real work to do on it, get the Pro: you can get $100 off the M5 iPad Pro in the U.S. which is a great deal on such a new device. The mini hasn’t had a meaningful update in a couple of generations. But as we noted in our review, it’s still the best tablet for its size and a great option for anyone who values ultra portability over screen size. There’s a decent $100 off. The standard entry-level iPad A16 is an absolute steal at its Black Friday price of $275, but stock is dwindling, so if you want one act fast. Foundry U.S. U.K. We’re seeing a great £100 saving on the iPad Air, but the deals on the other iPads in the U.K. aren’t as big as they are in the U.S. The M5 iPad Pro only has a small saving, so right now we are looking at the older models to get a better discount. With that in mind, we’d recommend the M4 iPad Pro if you can find one (it’s £206 off at Amazon, but selling out fast). Apple has a great deal on for Black Friday that will run through to December 1, 2025. You can subscribe for six months for just $5.99/£4.99 a month! That’s half price! Read more here: Get Apple TV for just $6 per month. David Price / Foundry Most iPhone deals in the U.S. are through carriers and require a trade-in or adding a new line. Carriers will likely have enticing deals with trade-ins as well, but be wary of long-term contracts and terms. One opportunity worth considering is Apple’s Black Friday deal: You can buy an iPhone from Apple and get a gift voucher: In the U.K. there are less limitations on the sale of iPhones so you will be able to pick one up unlocked at a discount if you would prefer to buy an iPhone up front, rather than on a contract. Apple only launched the iPhone 17 lineup in September, so it’s a surprise that we are seeing £100 off the iPhone Air. The iPhone 16e also has £100 off at Amazon: a good saving. Also be on the look out for deals (like this one from AO) on the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max which are no longer sold by Apple but would offer a good option to those who appreciate the extra camera on the Pro iPhone models but can’t stretch to the iPhone 17 Pro. We’d suggest that when it comes to the other deals you should weigh them up against Apple’s own giveaway, where you could get £60 or £40 vouchers with the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, or iPhone 16e, respectively. For example, £100 off an iPhone 16e is better than Apple’s £40 voucher, but AO’s £55 off iPhone 16 (128GB) (which has run out now) doesn’t match Apple’s £60 voucher deal so it would be worth waiting to see it that goes lower. These are the best deals we’ve seen so far: There are lots more Apple products you can buy to go with your new Mac, iPhone, or iPad. Whether it’s a mouse and keyboard for your Mac, an Apple Pencil or keyboard cover to go with your iPad, charging cables and adapters, we are keeping track of everything so you can grab a discount this Cyber Monday. It’s a great time to grab a pack of AirTags, with prices dropping to $65 or £74 for a pack of four of Apple’s tracking devices. And we are seeing some nice price cuts on Apple Pencils (just make sure they work with your iPad first). The Apple Pencil Pro ($34 off/£20 off) is the newest model and is compatible with the iPad Pro, iPad Air, and iPad mini. Thiago Trevisan/Foundry U.S. U.K. If it doesn’t have to be AirPods, take a look at these deals on Apple owned subsidiary Beats. You might also find some deals among our best earbuds for iPhones and Best over-ear headphones. U.S. U.K. Apple holds a shopping event every Black Friday, but it doesn’t offer actual discounts. Instead, Apple gives away gift cards when you buy certain products, which can be used on a future purchase. In 2025, Apple is offering the following gift card values over Black Friday weekend: This years deal is better than last year’s, with a maximum of $250/£200 being given away in the form of gift vouchers, and in some cases, such as the iPhones, we are seeing better savings via Apple than elsewhere.

Title: Update: Coping With Inflation–Strategies for Investing, Bartering, Dickering, and Survival
URL: https://survivalblog.com/2025/11/30/update-coping-with-inflation-strategies-for-investing-bartering-dickering-and-survival/
Time Published: 2025-11-29T20:00:33Z
Full Content:
JWR’s Introductory Note: This is an update to an article that I wrote for SurvivalBlog back in December, 2007. It is part of a series of SurvivalBlog 20th Anniversary update re-posts, in recognition of the fact that the majority of readers did not join us until recent years. — As of September, 2025, statistics released by the Federal government claim that the current inflation rate is 3.0 percent. That is utter hogwash. Their statistics cunningly omit “volatile” food and energy prices. It is apparent that something is seriously out of whack. Meanwhile, the buying power of the US Dollar has fallen versus most other currencies. Both under Biden’s administration and now under Trump’s second term, economic growth has slowed substantially. Ironically, even though credit squeezes are considered deflationary for assets, the next recession (or perhaps depression) will probably turn out to be inflationary at the consumer level. With out-of-control Federal deficit spending and a massive, compounding National Debt, I expect to see inflation continue and accelerate in the coming years. Here at the Rawles Ranch, our four largest expenses each month are fuel, groceries, livestock feed, and insurance. Our health insurance costs have nearly doubled in the past two years. The average new car now costs $50,000. I’m sure that you have seen what has happened to food and feed prices in the past two years. Driven by higher fuel and fertilizer costs, some food costs have gone up by 25%. Beef prices, for example, recently spiked to near record highs. With all of the preceding in mind, we can realistically conclude that the “real world” consumer price inflation rate is somewhere around 12%. As I’ve written many times before, inflation is a form of robbery, albeit in slow motion. Since there is effectively only one currency in our country, it is the only way to do business. It may prove difficult, but you need to discard your traditional mindset about the currency and realize that we are riding a down escalator. An inflationary environment stands traditional logic on its head, since “Saving” becomes losing, and “Investing” is almost like throwing coins into a pond if the rate of return of any investment is lower than the real world inflation rate. The only noteworthy exception is investing in tangibles, which I’ve discussed at length in many SurvivalBlog articles and columns. Obviously, you can’t invest in anything perishable. But there are lots of practical things–like tools, common caliber ammunition and full capacity magazines–that have storage lives that can span decades or even centuries. With every passing day, your savings are gradually eroded. With an effective inflation rate of 12% per annum, applying the Rule of 72 we can see how much the purchasing power of every “saved” dollar is reduced over time. The following are some of my suggestions on how to protect yourself from the ravages of inflation: A.) Buy in Bulk Buy most of your staple foods and groceries at a discount or “warehouse” type stores such as Costco or Sam’s Club. Don’t overlook the “close-out” and “dented can” stores. (But, of course, avoid buying any bulged cans, or cans with dented rims.) Stock up on non-perishable items whenever they are on sale: thing like light bulbs, paper products, bar soap, house cleaning supplies, laundry detergent, lubricants, and so forth. As long as you protect these supplies from theft, moisture and vermin, they are better than money in the bank. (Again, money in the bank is being eroded by inflation.) These are tangibles bought at today’s prices, that you can use for many years to come. Here at the Rawles Ranch, we recently used up some spices, light bulbs, and aluminum foil that I bought at a military commissary in the 1980s–at what now seem like absurdly low prices. My only regret is that I didn’t buy more of them! This approach to stockpiling was described in the modern-day classic book “The Alpha Strategy” by John Pugsley. (Download this free book and read it!) If your local zoning and fire regulations allow it, buy your own gas and diesel fuel tanks. Also consider installing oversize propane or home heating oil tanks. Always ask about the availability of used tanks or ‘trade-in” tanks. Who cares if they are in some odd color? Re-paint them a nice neutral tan color. Wait and have your extra-large tanks re-filled each time there is a price dip. (Sadly, this only happens rarely, these days.) When getting competitive bids from tank suppliers, be sure to ask them to lock in the price per gallon for the initial fill for each new tank. To win your business, the tank salesman might be willing to commit to a price that is a few pennies per gallon below current market. (This adds up on a 2,000+ gallon tank!) B.) Learn to Barter Barter, by its very nature, shields you from inflation. Instead of using depreciating paper tokens as a means of exchange, you are directly exchanging a tangible for another tangible, or a service for a tangible, or a service for a service. As I’ve written previously in SurvivalBlog on several occasions, I do advocate stocking up on extra items for barter. However, it is with the proviso that you do not embark on buying goods dedicated for barter until after you have your family’s essential beans, bullets and band-aids squared away, following a well-balanced logistics plan. Dickering is a skill that can take years to develop. For some details on dickering skills, dee my updated SurvivalBlog article: The Savvy Barterer: References, Skills, and Tools for TEOTWAWKI Barter. Here in The Un-named Western State (TUWS), there is a lot of bartering that goes on, quite informally. I see it all the time: Cartridge Reloading for Snow Plowing, Eggs for Honey, Firewood for Horse Training, and Zucchini for just a smile and a thank-you. To be useful in barter, choose items that have most or all of the following seven attributes 1.) Have appeal/usefulness to the majority of the citizenry. 2.) Be immediately recognizable. 3.) Have longevity. 4.) Be easily divisible. 5.) Be relatively compact and transportable at reasonable cost. 6.) Have consistent quality. 7.) Have limited availability. Let’s discuss each of those briefly, in turn. 1.) Have appeal/usefulness to the majority of the citizenry. Nearly every family uses soap, but just a few need #7 Singer sewing machine needles. 2.) Be immediately recognizable. Name brands need no introduction. All others are suspect. 3.) Have longevity. Keep shelf lives in mind. If you cannot barter it all away before it goes bad, then you are buying too much. Even coal has a shelf life. 4.) Be easily divisible. Boxes of matches, boxes of cartridges, coils of rope, balls of twine, and cans of kerosene are perfect examples. OBTW, if you plan on dividing a commodity in barter transactions, then be sure to have the containers needed for parceling it out. 5.) Be relatively compact and transportable at a reasonable cost. Toilet paper has great appeal, but just $500 worth would completely fill the JASBORR. 6.) Have consistent quality. (For example, precious metals coins of known purity, or ammunition from a major manufacturer such as Winchester, Remington, or Federal.) 7.) Have limited availability. I mentioned zucchini earlier, for good reason. In North America, jars of freeze-dried instant coffee would be ideal, but in Central America, they would probably be laughed at. For some extensive lists of potential barter items suggested by readers, see the SurvivalBlog Archives for October 2005 and November 2005 (scroll down to November 1st and 2nd.) For a good rationale on selecting barter goods, see this November, 2006 SurvivalBlog article by OSOM. C.) Learn Several Valuable (Barterable) Skills Every family should have at least one home-based business that they can fall back on, on the event of an economic recession or depression. Concentrate on skills rather than goods for barter. The beauty of having skills to barter, is that most of them don’t require much raw material. So, unlike barter goods, you will never “run out”. By extension, it is best to have a skill that requires very little raw material. A profession or skill that also requires a specialized tool set is fine. However, if the skill also requires delivering a factory-made device to complete each transaction, then you might consider doing something else. (For example, installing burglar alarms might be profitable as long as you have a source of resupply, and as long as the power and telephone networks are functioning. But in a grid-down TEOTWAWKI how long could you continue running such a business?) Avoid developing a skill that appeals only to wealthy customers for discretionary spending. Those are the purchases that will be delayed or skipped altogether in an economic depression, Hence, shotgun checkering and engraving are poor choices, but septic tank pumping is a good one. Concentrate on a business that can be operated without the need for grid power. It is notewothy that most of the businesses in this category existed in the 19th Century. Who knows? Maybe buggy whip makers will make a comeback in the Second Great Depression. Ideally, you should have two or even three supplementary income businesses that you can fall back on to pay your mortgage and to buy necessities, if you lose your salaried job. Depending on the severity of the coming recession or depression, some home-based business may thrive, while others won’t. It is hard to predict which businesses will do well (although we have some clues based on the experience of the 1930s,) so there is safety in redundancy. D.) Learn How to Pinch a Penny Here are some suggestions (in no particular order), some of which I’ve borrowed from “The Encyclopedia of Country Living” by Carla Emery. (We highly recommend this book.) Distinguish your needs from your wants. Research and do some comparison pricing before any purchase of more than $10. Do extensive comparison pricing before any purchase of more than $100. Never buy on impulse. Plan your purchases well in advance, do your homework, and be patient. Refer to back issues of Consumer Reports magazine (at your local library) before making a purchase of a major appliance Develop the habit of dropping by thrift stores, second-hand stores, used book stores, and pawn shops. Find out on which days particular items are discounted at thrift stores. (Often by a system of colored price tags.) For big-ticket items, do lots of comparison pricing via the Internet. If you decide to buy locally, then bring the price print-outs with you, to use as “ammunition” when you dicker. Buy off-season. Buy winter clothes in summer, and vice versa. Buy livestock in October and November, when owners are facing expensive hay purchases if they “winter-over” their livestock. Use a clothesline instead of an electric clothes dryer. Use online tools like GasBuddy to find the best local gas and diesel prices. This is particularly important when you re-fill your gasoline and diesel storage cans and drums. Heat with wood. Cut, haul, split, and stack the wood yourself. Buy your guns and ammo at gun shows, not at gun shops. Learn how to dicker for the best prices. Buy at farm auctions, but beware of impulse purchases and run-away bidding. Make a list of your maximum bids during the preview and then stick to it religiously. Never bid emotionally, and never jump in on the bidding for an article unless you planned to bid on it before the auction began. Build/make/sew things for yourself rather than buying them factory-made. If you use any national brands, then clip coupons. Keep your coupons well organized (many folks like to use an accordion folder and they keep it handy in their car), and don’t lose track of coupon expiration dates. Buy most items used, rather than new. Never buy a new “big ticket” item like a car or truck “factory new”. Be sure to refer to Edmunds.com before making any vehicle purchase, to make sure you aren’t getting a “lemon” model or model-year. If you are buying a used vehicle worth $5,000 or more, then get the car’s VIN and pay for a CARFAX vehicle history report. These reports show a car’s crash history and even flood damage history. That research is well worth the expense. Negotiate prices with merchants. It is amazing who is willing to negotiate. (But I’ve had no luck in talking down bridge toll fees. I’ll keep trying.) Spend some of your Saturday mornings at garage sales and yard sales. Dress down when you go, and don’t be afraid to negotiate for better prices. Check Craig’sList, Facebook Marketplace, eBay, and your local “penny” or “nickel” classified ad papers for bargain items or even free items. Avoid fashion trends. Dress and drive modestly. Find out when there is a curb-side “free hauling” day offered by your local waste disposal contractor. If allowable by local law, cruise through the neighborhoods the night before the scheduled collection with your pickup or trailer. This is the way we found the majority of our small livestock cages. When buying things from private parties or small businesses, offer other items or your skills in barter. Watch for free tours at educational places like factories and museums. If your community has a well-established local currency, then utilize it to the utmost. Plant a large vegetable garden. Get plant starts for berries and other perennials from neighbors Cancel your newspaper subscriptions and carefully limit your magazine subscriptions. These days, there is so much news and information available on the Internet free of charge (you are looking at some of it right now) that hardcopy newspapers are now mostly expensive dinosaurs. But there are two notable exceptions: 1.) If you are a consistent and well-organized coupon clipper. If that is the case, then you might want to get a “Sunday paper only” subscription.), and 2.) Subscribing to small-town weekly newspapers in your retreat locale. Reading one of these papers regularly is important for developing local intelligence and for “fitting in” by being knowledgeable about local geography, personalities, events, politics, and lore. Change your own car crankcase oil and make most of your own car repairs. Buy a food dehydrator. It will pay for itself many times over. Home Freeze-Dryers are also now available, but before buying one, carefully consider how much you will use it. It takes a long time for these expensive units to pay for themselves. Learn how to do your own water bath and pressure canning. Once you have, you’ll have no excuse to ever buy another store-bought jar of jam, jelly, or applesauce. Buy a few dairy sheep or a cow. Sell or barter the excess milk, or feed the excess to your chickens and/or hogs Cut out needless expenses. (Like those $4 lattes at Starbucks and $20 trips to the movie theater.) If you have a mortgage at a rate that is more than 1 percent higher than the prevailing rate, then consider refinancing. Just beware of any hidden costs and, of course, avoid Adjustable Rate Mortgages (ARMs.) Swap CDs and DVDs with friends and relatives or check them out from your local library rather than buying new ones. Keep your online video subscriptions to a minimum. Develop a budget, and stick to it. If you have a credit card, then pay it off in full every month. No exceptions! Don’t fall into the easy credit trap. Remember, the card is only in your wallet for convenience, emergency expenses (such as car repairs when travelling), and as a means to gain frequent flier miles or points for programs like gasoline purchase rebates. If you recognize that you don’t have sufficient self-control, then leave your credit card(s) at home–or cut them up. Make detailed lists of all of your expenses, and scrutinize them weekly. Look for ways to reduce expenses. Shop around for the lowest car/health/home/life insurance rates. A few hours of research on the Internet could easily save you $1,000+ per year. Unless you know for certain that you want a book as a permanent reference, then use the public library or try to find it online. Don’t overlook the inter-library loan system. Take advantage of free or low-cost training available from organizations like the American Red Cross and FEMA. (Just beware of any socialist/statist nonsense that they try to feed you along with the training.) Learn how to repair small appliances and engines. Don’t buy store-bought meat. Hunt for or raise your own. Handload your own ammunition. Get out of debt and stay out of debt. Paying interest is throwing money away. Forestall making purchases to avoid indebtedness. Instant gratification creates decades of debt. Proviso #1: Do not attempt to save money by foregoing carrying insurance, or by forestalling any expenses that have an impact on health, hygiene, or safety. For example, if your windshield gets cracked beyond repair, then replace it. If your chimney needs cleaning, then don’t delay cleaning it. (But of course buy your own brush and rod sections and learn how to do the job yourself.) If you have a toothache, don’t delay in seeing your dentist. (But ask about possibly paying in barter when you do!) Proviso# 2: Don’t be “Penny-wise and Pound-foolish.” If you are a highly-paid professional, then take into account the value of your time. For example, if you are an anesthesiologist, you should probably find a few more billable cases rather than taking up cartridge handloading. Proviso# 3: Don’t skimp on education. That is an expense that will make you money in the long run. In closing, remember (and recite frequently) this old adage: “Use it up, wear it out, make do, or do without.” James Wesley, Rawles (JWR) is Founder and Senior Editor of SurvivalBlog, the original prepping /survival blog for when the Schumer Hits The Fan (SHTF).

Even Apple runs its own Black Friday shopping event, where it offers gift cards on certain purchases, including $50 with AirPods Pro 3, $100 for iPad Air, and $250 with a MacBook Pro. The bottom line is that there are lots of deals to be found right now, so no matter what Apple device you’re looking for, you will be able to make a saving. So take a look at the deals on all of Apple’s products below. Also, check our Best Picks round-ups, where you can find reviews of all the products we recommend. At Macworld we’ve been covering and reviewing Apple and Apple devices for more than 40 years, from the original Macintosh to the most recent M5 MacBook Pro and iPhone 17 lineup. We use Apple products every day and purchase them with our own money, so we know a good deal when we see one. More importantly, we also know how to spot a bad deal. With a working knowledge of everything Apple sells and decades of experience, we know when stores are inflating prices or pushing “normal” sales as limited Black Friday deals, so the listings you see here will only be for discounts that are at or near all-time low prices. Macworld Cyber Monday tip: While shopping during the Black Friday sales, we’ve noticed that on Amazon, if you delay your delivery date, there are additional 2-3% savings to be had. This doesn’t apply to every Apple product, unfortunately, but we have seen the additional 3% applied to AirTags, and if you have lots of other eligible products in your shopping cart, then it can add up to decent savings. Apple released the new M5 MacBook Pro in October, but still sells M4 Pro and M4 Max models as well as the M4 MacBook Air. The new M5 model is mostly a chip refresh, but it’s a great one, as we said in our 4.5-star review, and right now you can get $250 off all the 14-inch M5 MacBook Pro at Amazon, taking it $50 lower than last Thursday and down to the lowest price we have seen. However, even though the new model brings a major boost in GPU and SSD performance, we also loved the M4 model, and you can get an amazing $300 off the M4 MacBook Pro at Amazon. There are also some excellent deals on the even more powerful MacBook Pro M4 Pro and M4 Max, which are full on workstations now at amazingly low prices, such as $300 off the 14-inch M4 Pro MacBook Pro at Amazon, and a whopping $500 off the 16-inch M4 Max MacBook Pro, also at Amazon. You can find more deals below. And, of course, the MacBook Air is a fantastic option for just about anyone, earning an extremely rare 5-star score in our testing. You can get $250 off the MacBook Air at Amazon. U.K. shoppers don’t miss out either, with £184 off a 13-inch MacBook Air at Amazon. £200 off the M5 MacBook Pro at KRCS, and £349 off the M4 Pro MacBook Pro at Amazon. See even more great deals below. Foundry U.S. U.K. The iMac and Mac mini received an M4 update in October 2024, with the Mac mini also getting a dramatic redesign that shrunk the case down to just 5 inches. We loved the new Mac mini design and M4 chip and there is $120 off at Amazon. The Mac mini M4 Pro version is a great low-cost way to get a really powerful Mac, and with $150 off it’s a good saving (but it was $200 earlier in the Black Friday sale). We don’t know when they will be getting M5 chips, but if they are, they won’t arrive until 2026, so we recommend picking up one of these deals if you’re looking for a Mac desktop. U.K. users should take advantage of £100 off the Mac mini, and £130 off the Mac mini pro. Simon Jary / Foundry U.S. U.K. Apple released the AirPods Pro 3 in September 2025, with a slightly new design, foam-infused eartips, and a heart-rate sensor. We gave them a near-perfect score in our review, but also noted that it’s a relatively small upgrade over the AirPods Pro 2, which has the same H2 chip and many similar features. The new model has the same $249 MSRP in the U.S. and a slightly lower £219 RRP in the U.K. (AirPods Pro 2 were £229), so keep that in mind when shopping. We don’t expect to see AirPods Pro 3 with more than $30-$50 off, but the older AirPods Pro 2 did dip as low as $139 at Walmart, but that deal seems to have ended now, the next best option is $189 on Amazon. The AirPods 4 have been out for over a year, but are still a fantastic pair of earbuds. The Black Friday deals of $69 for AirPods 4 was superb, but stock seems to have run out now (check to see if the model is user). You can still get AirPods 4 with active noise cancellation for less than $100, which is an excellent deal. If you need a pair, grab one, just beware that AirPods deals sell out quickly, but do keep checking because stock seems to come and go. See more U.S. AirPods deals below. U.K. readers can save money on the AirPods Pro 2, currently at £169 with Argos, but we’ve also seen them at that price on Amazon (but they go out of stock quickly!). Right now you can also get £20 off the AirPods 4, bringing the price under £100. See more U.K. AirPods deals below. Petter Ahrnstedt U.S. U.K. Mike Sawh Apple launched the Apple Watch Series 11 in September, but there aren’t many exclusive new features beyond better battery life and 5G networking. The two new health features, hypertension alerts and Sleep Score, are also available on the Series 10, and there isn’t a new color this year. As we noted in our review, we don’t think Series 9 or 10 users need to upgrade. We are seeing savings of $60 on the Series 11, which is a great price for such a full-featured watch, but with $150 off the Series 10 you might want to consider that, you won’t miss out on much (See our comparison of every Apple Watch). The sleeper hit of the new Apple Watch lineup is the SE 3, which got the biggest update of all three models, gaining an always-on display, temperature sensor, a faster chip, on-device Siri, and fast charging. We gave it a near-perfect score of 4.5 stars and highly recommend it at full price—for $50 off, it’s a no-brainer decision. At the high end, the Ultra 3 has a slightly larger screen, satellite connectivity, and longer battery life compared to last year’s model. We’ve seen $150 off, but if you want one, we’d recommend this $599 deal on the Ultra 2 instead. U.S. U.K. In the U.K. the deals are small on the newest Apple Watch models, but we anticipate that they will improve once Black Friday is here. And if they don’t our advice would be to snap up Apple’s offer, which will get you a £40 gift card. The biggest deals on offer right now are on the older models. We’d recommend Argos’s £200 off the Apple Watch Ultra 2 and Curry’s £130 off the Apple Watch Series 10. Just keep in mind that in the U.K., Apple cut the Apple Watch Series 11 and Ultra 3 prices by £30 and £50 compared to the previous generation when they were introduced. Keep this in mind when shopping, because some stores might make savings appear to be larger than they actually are. Apple updated the iPad Air with an M3 chip and the iPad Pro with an M5 chip this year. Neither update brings any huge reason to upgrade, but they’re both excellent tablets. It comes down to preference and budget—if you’re largely using your tablet for consumption (streaming, surfing, games), get an Air, for which we are seeing prices cut by $150, but if you have real work to do on it, get the Pro: you can get $100 off the M5 iPad Pro in the U.S. which is a great deal on such a new device. The mini hasn’t had a meaningful update in a couple of generations. But as we noted in our review, it’s still the best tablet for its size and a great option for anyone who values ultra portability over screen size. There’s a decent $100 off. The standard entry-level iPad A16 is an absolute steal at its Black Friday price of $275, but stock is dwindling, so if you want one act fast. Foundry U.S. U.K. We’re seeing a great £100 saving on the iPad Air, but the deals on the other iPads in the U.K. aren’t as big as they are in the U.S. The M5 iPad Pro only has a small saving, so right now we are looking at the older models to get a better discount. With that in mind, we’d recommend the M4 iPad Pro if you can find one (it’s £206 off at Amazon, but selling out fast). Apple has a great deal on for Black Friday that will run through to December 1, 2025. You can subscribe for six months for just $5.99/£4.99 a month! That’s half price! Read more here: Get Apple TV for just $6 per month. David Price / Foundry Most iPhone deals in the U.S. are through carriers and require a trade-in or adding a new line. Carriers will likely have enticing deals with trade-ins as well, but be wary of long-term contracts and terms. One opportunity worth considering is Apple’s Black Friday deal: You can buy an iPhone from Apple and get a gift voucher: In the U.K. there are less limitations on the sale of iPhones so you will be able to pick one up unlocked at a discount if you would prefer to buy an iPhone up front, rather than on a contract. Apple only launched the iPhone 17 lineup in September, so it’s a surprise that we are seeing £100 off the iPhone Air. The iPhone 16e also has £100 off at Amazon: a good saving. Also be on the look out for deals (like this one from AO) on the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max which are no longer sold by Apple but would offer a good option to those who appreciate the extra camera on the Pro iPhone models but can’t stretch to the iPhone 17 Pro. We’d suggest that when it comes to the other deals you should weigh them up against Apple’s own giveaway, where you could get £60 or £40 vouchers with the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, or iPhone 16e, respectively. For example, £100 off an iPhone 16e is better than Apple’s £40 voucher, but AO’s £55 off iPhone 16 (128GB) (which has run out now) doesn’t match Apple’s £60 voucher deal so it would be worth waiting to see it that goes lower. These are the best deals we’ve seen so far: There are lots more Apple products you can buy to go with your new Mac, iPhone, or iPad. Whether it’s a mouse and keyboard for your Mac, an Apple Pencil or keyboard cover to go with your iPad, charging cables and adapters, we are keeping track of everything so you can grab a discount this Cyber Monday. It’s a great time to grab a pack of AirTags, with prices dropping to $65 or £74 for a pack of four of Apple’s tracking devices. And we are seeing some nice price cuts on Apple Pencils (just make sure they work with your iPad first). The Apple Pencil Pro ($34 off/£20 off) is the newest model and is compatible with the iPad Pro, iPad Air, and iPad mini. Thiago Trevisan/Foundry U.S. U.K. If it doesn’t have to be AirPods, take a look at these deals on Apple owned subsidiary Beats. You might also find some deals among our best earbuds for iPhones and Best over-ear headphones. U.S. U.K. Apple holds a shopping event every Black Friday, but it doesn’t offer actual discounts. Instead, Apple gives away gift cards when you buy certain products, which can be used on a future purchase. In 2025, Apple is offering the following gift card values over Black Friday weekend: This years deal is better than last year’s, with a maximum of $250/£200 being given away in the form of gift vouchers, and in some cases, such as the iPhones, we are seeing better savings via Apple than elsewhere.
