Title: Tylenol to join Kleenex, Huggies and Listerine in $48.7 billion takeover deal between Kimberly-Clark and Kenvue

Time Published: 2025-11-04T11:47:11Z
Full Content:
Kimberly-Clark is buying Tylenol maker Kenvue in a cash and stock deal worth about $48.7 billion, creating a massive consumer health goods company. Shareholders of Kimberly-Clark will own about 54% of the combined company. Kenvue shareholders will own about 46% in what is one of the largest corporate takeovers this year. The deal must still be approved by the shareholders of both companies. The combined company will have a huge stable of household brands under one roof, putting Kenvue’s Listerine mouthwash and Band-Aid side-by-side with Kimberly-Clark’s Cottonelle toilet paper, Huggies and Kleenex tissues. It will also generate about $32 billion in annual revenue. Kenvue has spent a relatively brief period as an independent company, having been spun off by Johnson & Johnson two years ago. J&J first announced in late 2021 that it was splitting its slow-growth consumer health division from the pharmaceutical and medical device divisions. Kenvue has since been targeted by activist investors unhappy about the trajectory of the company and Wall Street appeared to anticipate some heavy lifting ahead for Kimberly-Clark. Kenvue’s stock jumped 12% Monday afternoon, while shares of Kimberly-Clark, based outside of Dallas, slumped by nearly 15%. Kenvue shares have shed nearly 50% of their value since approaching $28 in the spring of 2023. Morningstar analyst Keonhee Kim said Kenvue’s volatile journey as a public company may have been driven in part by poor execution and a lack of experience operating as a stand-alone business. He said the leadership of a more-established consumer products company like Kimberly-Clark could help unlock some of Kenvue’s value. He also noted that Kenvue brands include Neutrogena, Benadryl and other names that have been in store consumer health aisles for decades. Kim said he thinks Kimberly-Clark may have seen upside in adding those products. “I think that may have made the deal a lot more attractive … especially after the past couple of months of Kenvue’s stock price decline,” he said. Kenvue and Tylenol have been thrust into the national spotlight this year as President Donald Trump and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. promoted unproven and in some cases discredited ties between Tylenol, vaccines and the complex brain disorder autism. Trump then urged pregnant women against using the medicine. That went beyond Food and Drug Administration advice that doctors “should consider minimizing” the painkiller acetaminophen’s use in pregnancy — amid inconclusive evidence about whether too much could be linked to autism. Kennedy reiterated the FDA guidance during a press conference last week. He said that there isn’t sufficient evidence to link the drug to autism. “We have asked physicians to minimize the use to when it’s absolutely necessary,” he said. Kenvue has continued to push back on the Trump administration’s public statements about Tylenol and acetaminophen, the active ingredient it contains. “We strongly disagree with allegations that it does and are deeply concerned about the health risks and confusion this poses for expecting mothers and parents,” Kenvue said in a statement on its website. The merger could face other hurdles. Citi Investment Research analyst Filippo Falorni said he is concerned about the deal’s size given the recent history in the sector, particularly given the challenges faced by Kenvue. In July, Kenvue announced that CEO Thibaut Mongon was leaving in the midst of a strategic review, with the company under mounting pressure from activist investors unhappy about growth. Critics say Kenvue has relied too much on its legacy brands and failed to innovate. Industry analysts also point out the poor track record for mergers involving consumer packaged goods companies. In September, Kraft Heinz said it would break up its decade-old merger. Its net revenue has fallen every year since 2020. Kimberly-Clark and Kenvue, like Kraft Heinz, are facing increasing competition from cheaper store brands. In 2024, 51% of toilet paper and other household paper products sold in the U.S were store brands, according to Circana, a market research company, while store brands held a 24% share of sales of health products, including medications and vitamins. On Monday, a bottle of 100 extra-strength Tylenol caplets cost $10.97 on Walmart’s website. A bottle of 100 extra-strength acetaminophen caplets from Walmart’s Equate brand cost $1.98. Inflation drove some of that buyer behavior, Circana said. Shoppers are also shifting their purchases to stores with more private-label brands, like Aldi and Costco. And stores are improving their offerings and adding more of them; last year, Walmart and Target both launched new store brands to complement their existing ones. Still, both Kimberly-Clark and Kenvue make name-brand products in segments where consumers are less likely to shift to store brands, including hair care, skin care, feminine products and mouth care, according to Circana. Kenvue owns brands like Aveeno and Neutrogena, for example, while Kimberly-Clark makes Kotex and Depend. Kimberly-Clark Chairman and CEO Mike Hsu will be chairman and CEO of the combined company. Three members of the Kenvue’s board will join Kimberly-Clark’s board at closing. The combined company will keep Kimberly-Clark’s headquarters in Irving, Texas, but there will be significant operations around Kenvue facilities and locations as well. The deal is expected to close in the second half of next year. It still needs approval from shareholders of both both companies. Kenvue shareholders will receive $3.50 per share in cash and 0.14625 Kimberly-Clark shares for each Kenvue share held at closing. That amounts to $21.01 per share, based on the closing price of Kimberly-Clark shares on Friday. Kimberly-Clark and Kenvue said that they identified about $1.9 billion in cost savings that are expected in the first three years after the transaction’s closing. ___ AP Health Writer Tom Murphy contributed to this report. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Transcription (Edited): Darren: Hi, I’m Darren Woolley, founder and CEO of TrinityP3 Marketing Management Consultancy, and welcome to Managing Marketing, a weekly podcast discussing the issues and opportunities facing marketing, media, and advertising with industry thought leaders. If you’re enjoying the podcast, please like, review, or share this episode. To be the marketing leader for a major successful consumer packaged goods brand is one thing, but to oversee a portfolio of high-profile, well-loved brands—almost cultural signposts in the market, with decades of prominence—is a major challenge. How do you honor that tradition while nurturing these brands through changes in consumer dietary needs and habits? My guest today has taken on such a challenge at Bega Group. Please welcome the Executive General Manager at Bega Group, Darryn Wallace. Welcome, Darryn. Darryn: Hello, Darren, and thank you for having me. It’s a pleasure to join your podcast today. Career Evolution in Iconic CPG Brands Darren: It’s great catching up. We met when you were at Cadbury, and I’ve followed your career as you’ve built expertise in CPG, beverages, and most recently, dairy. How did you get here? Darryn: I got into consumer goods by chance. I joined Cadbury Schweppes as a graduate in the finance team, which gave me two or three years of grounding in how a business works. I was fortunate to join a company that invested in management experience and learning. I was able to weave my way through many roles, eventually becoming the general manager of marketing at Cadbury, applying the trade to growing great brands. I’ve always had a passion for creating products that the Australian public can love. I’ve zigzagged across categories: confectionery and beverage, and for the last 10 years, dairy, juice, spreads, and staples like Vegemite, Bega Peanut Butter, and Super-Duper ice creams. I’ve been fortunate to work on iconic local brands, but also global brands like Pepsi, Gatorade, and Red Bull. Darren: The portfolio you now manage includes what I call “passion brands.” Vegemite is a cultural signpost. Dairy Farmers, Daily Juice, Pura, and Bega are staples. It must be interesting to apply your global and local experience to these cultural icons. Darryn: If you think about it too long, you can be intimidated. Brands like Farmers Union Greek yogurt (1888), Bega (1899), and Dairy Farmers (1900) are in their third century. You feel a great sense of responsibility and accountability to ensure they remain relevant for today and the next generation. I find it exciting to shape brands with such established heritage and personality to make them modern. The Bega Group is one of the largest agricultural businesses listed on the ASX. We are Australian-owned and local. The ability to be empowered and manage these brands using our local team, local insights, science, and technology is incredibly rewarding. Local Ownership and Relationships in the Dairy Sector Darren: The heavy emphasis on dairy is interesting. Dairy was traditionally connected to the farm, often through co-ops, before corporatization. The industry seems to benefit significantly from local ownership. Darryn: It does. My first impression was that it’s a business of relationships. We run personalized relationships with over 800 farmers across the country who are critical to our success. The market was regulated for a long time, so brands like Big M in Victoria and Masters Milk in West Australia have deep history in their local communities, creating high levels of trust and loyalty. Dairy is an “always on” business. With short shelf-life products, you’re fighting for distribution every day. Our ability to service the market relies on deep relationships because we’re running seven days a week, 52 weeks a year. CPG/FMCG as the Ideal Marketing Training Ground Darren: Many marketers say starting a career in CPG/FMCG is one of the best ways to get hands-on training in the full skillset of marketing. Teams work across product, packaging, pricing, and distribution. Do you feel this comprehensive training is important? Darryn: One hundred percent. I was fortunate to join Cadbury Schweppes when it was integrating businesses, giving it a broad portfolio. As a local business, we had the autonomy to influence what products we made, how we marketed them, where we sold them, and how we priced and promoted them. Cadbury also invested heavily in people, providing training in core marketing disciplines and executive skills like managing change and acquisitions. This comprehensive training has changed over the last 10 years due to globalization. But one of the joys of working with the Bega Group is that we are a local business, which retains the ability to steward brands through a great local team with autonomy over brands and customer relationships. Darren: In global organizations, there’s often more siloing. A strength of CPG/FMCG is a clear understanding of the role of sales to customers (securing pricing and distribution) and marketing to consumers (driving demand) working hand-in-hand—the basis of the Four Ps. Darryn: I have a philosophy I call “removing alibis”—getting rid of excuses so the team can do their best work. Accountability is high. You have to develop the right product with the right insights, explain it to the customer so they stock it, have it come off the shelf, and ensure the consumer likes it enough to buy it again. You learn through doing, and you have no one else to blame. The ability for all technical and specialist functions to work in concert makes the difference. Darren: I find the talk that the generalist is no longer needed overlooks dealing with complexity. While you have specialists (the vertical of the ‘T’ capability), you still need someone with an overview to bring it all together (the horizontal of the ‘T’). Darryn: I grew up in a world that prioritized getting the product right and ensuring availability before promotion or advertising. That generalized capability is really important—knowing which dots to join up. I’m highly dependent on the team and the new skills they bring. I didn’t grow up in the e-commerce era, where for some categories, a third of sales are consumed online. The ability to blend that breadth of knowledge and experience with the art needed in each discipline is key. Product Trends and E-commerce in a Portfolio Strategy Darren: Thirty percent of sales through e-commerce is significant. While people focus on performance media in e-commerce, brand has never been more important. Also, customer experience of the brand has become more important than just the messaging. Darryn: We all shop with our eyes. In a digital environment, products need to “pop off the page and say, ‘Purchase me.'” For food or beverage, it’s the appetite appeal of the images, the relevant words, and being in the right place on the digital shelf. All these disciplines are still focused on making sure we stand out in the most compelling way. We have a large portfolio—more than 30 brands. To manage this, we prioritize eight “power brands” that are market leaders, bring a clear point of difference, and represent over three quarters of our profit. We look after the base and prioritize those eight to make them relevant and future-proof. Darren: Let’s focus on dairy trends. Dairy is ancient, yet we see trends like high fat, low fat, and now high protein. How do you determine whether a trend is a short-term fad or worth tapping into? Darryn: Protein is nearly a mega-trend right now, driven partly by a consequence of COVID. People of all ages are proactively attuned to their health and well-being, consciously focusing on macronutrients. Darren: The focus on longevity and the switch against sugar and carbohydrates have replaced the old low-fat focus, which often relied on corn syrup or high sugar to replace texture. This is now replaced by the need for high protein. Darryn: Flavored milk has taken the next leap. Dairy is a great source of protein, so we can now offer a drink with 30 grams of protein, no added sugar, and reduced fat milk. It brings all the macronutrients of dairy—hydration, calcium, B vitamins, and protein—at a low calorific value. This has become a convenient, enjoyable, and affordable meal replacement. We are seeing the advancement of functionality in dairy. pouch yogurt continues to grow because of its convenience and ease of consumption, with many offering 15 grams of protein. Distribution, Pricing, and the “Always On” Operation Darren: Let’s talk about distribution. I initially thought of your brands as supermarket grocery, but dairy drinks are in every convenience store and servo, plus 30% online. Darryn: I’ve really enjoyed the breadth of customer or channel in dairy. For yogurt, we sell through traditional supermarkets, bulk discounters (Costco, Aldi), online, petrol stations (7-Eleven), health and aged care, and QSR (McDonald’s Happy Meals). Back-of-house yogurt and cream go into most restaurants and cafes. We serve a diverse customer base, so understanding the right offers, pack sizes, and pricing equations for each is vital. Packaging serves multiple roles: providing the correct serve size and representing the brand as a trust mark. Darren: On pricing, the cost-of-living crisis has seen prices on essentials increase significantly, driven by whole supply chain issues, especially energy. Darryn: Inflation has been a real challenge for the Australian public, and dairy has been at the heart of it. We’ve had environmental issues impacting the cost to produce milk, as well as rising costs for transport, ingredients, and packaging. Dairy is a low-margin category, so our focus is productivity first, then pricing to offset costs after all productivity measures. We are deliberate about what price to take, on which products, and how it aligns with household affordability. The last few years have been challenging because you don’t want to take a price that causes consumers to reappraise your brand. Darren: With the short shelf-life of fresh white milk (18 to 20 days is the shortest), there’s little time to move the product from farm to consumption. You’re constantly trying to build a business model that’s efficient and without disruption. This makes it a seven-day-a-week operation—you constantly have to move. Brand Promotion and Distinctive Advertising Darren: For the agencies listening, let’s get onto promotion. You have brands with decades of positioning. What’s your philosophy or approach to advertising for building these brands? Darryn: It’s changed slightly in the last 10 years. We probably don’t invest enough, but where we do, we aim to be noticed and distinctive, leveraging existing assets and fame. For Dairy Farmers, the traditional ad would have shown the farmer, cows, and rolling paddocks, focusing on purity. Our most recent ad shows a cow surfing on a surfboard with people eating different Dairy Farmers products. We are trying to bring more personality and emotion to the advertising and move away from stereotypes. We wanted to capture the emotion of feeling alive and ready to conquer the day. Our advertising is about being brave to do something different. The message, “start the day with oomph,” brings distinctiveness and works well across all aspects of the brand. To me, staying modern, bringing personality to life, and capturing the emotion is the key to building loyalty. Darren: Absolutely. The heritage was good for its time, but being much more consumer-focused—answering the question “what’s in it for me?”—is really important, and your approach does that. Darryn, time has run away from us. It’s been an absolute pleasure, and thank you so much for sharing what you’re doing at Bega Group. Darryn: No, I thank you for being able to spend this time. Hopefully, there are a few nuggets for your listeners to take out of our conversation.

Title: I Tried Aldi's Diet Coke Copycat And It's Not Even Close To Everyone's Favorite Fridge Cig

As of 2025, Diet Coke reigns as the number one diet soda in the U.S., which doesn't surprise me at all. I will check and see if restaurants have Coke or Pepsi before I go. I'm that picky. And I'm not the only fan! Diet Coke ranks fifth among all top-selling sodas in general, coming in after regular Coca-Cola, Dr Pepper, Sprite, and Pepsi, in that order. And there are a lot of sodas out there! But recently, we heard a little rumor that there was a Diet Coke dupe that tasted even better and was cheaper, which had us more than intrigued. Personally, as a diehard Diet Coke fan, I have to say I was incredibly suspicious and needed to do my own investigating. (Those are some pretty big claims to be making.) The copycat — Aldi's Summit brand diet cola — is one of many dupes by this grocery store. Luckily, there is an Aldi very close to me, so I ran right out to grab a 12-pack. Already having Diet Coke on hand, because I use it in everything from mocktails and cocktails to baking sweet treats, it would be easy to do a head-to-head taste test. Giving each a 24-hour window to chill in my refrigerator, I sat down to taste them. I was ready for anything. I took a deep breath and opened my mind to the possibilities. Would it taste the same? Would it actually be better? Well, here's what I found. When working on this piece, Summit Diet Cola was available at my Aldi for $4.69 for a 12-pack of 12-ounce cans. There are over 2,500 Aldi locations scattered through 39 states in the U.S. So, the availability is somewhat accessible, although not as widely distributed as Diet Coke. As far as Diet Coke goes, at my local Kroger, there is always a BOGO sale going on, so I always stock up. The week I purchased these sodas, it was a buy two, get three free weekend sale. With a 12-pack of 12-ounce cans costing $10.99, that worked out to $4.39 per pack, which was an even better deal than Aldi. While Kroger only operates in 16 states and territories, I feel like there are other stores that probably offer similar discounts. When I checked out Walmart prices at the time of this writing, it had 24-packs of Diet Coke cans for $13.78, making a 12-pack $6.89. And Walmart does operate in all 50 states. Additionally, Costco (operating in 49 states and territories) had 35-packs of cans for $19.85, which would leave you paying around $6.60 per 12-pack. So, there are deals to be had if cost is an issue. I cracked open the chilled can of Summit Diet Cola and went in for my first taste. It had an immediate sweet cloud that covered my palate and filled my mouth. There was a nice carbonation about it that tingled my tongue and gave the soda an overall round, full profile. Oddly, there was an overly obvious citrus taste to it that reminded me of the lemon and lime flavor of Sprite, but with a touch of vanilla. It wasn't bad, just odd. But it couldn't garner too much attention, as the sweet flavor demanded center stage throughout. The sweetness tasted artificial and exceedingly apparent, like a small child vying for the spotlight. It carried the flavor in and stayed long after any citrus, spice, or carbonation was gone. And while it didn't go over the top or become offensive, it was still somehow larger than it needed to be. In the end, all the tastes stopped very abruptly, leaving the palate seemingly coated with a nothingness that wasn't entirely clean. This diet cola wasn't bad, but it was very obviously an off-brand, a generic interpretation of something familiar. I could taste what it was trying to achieve, but it tried too hard and missed the mark with its overzealous flavoring. Taking a sip of Diet Coke offered a layer of flavors and carbonation to cascade across my taste buds, dancing with tiny, prickling bubbles. There seemed to be a blanket of caramel that was soft, lush, and slightly sweet. Underneath the caramel was a hint of citrus that seemed to complement the spicy aesthetic without drawing too much attention to itself. The sweetness of it all seemed to be but a welcome guest of equal measure on the journey of flavors. Nothing tasted to stand out on its own; rather, every flavor worked together in harmony. The flavors of Diet Coke appeared to be deliberately refined, balanced on rich fizz that teased the taste buds into new heights of enjoyment. And when it left my mouth, the flavors and slight burn of carbonation lingered only for a moment before taking their final leave. Overall, refreshing and soft but strong, drinking Diet Coke was incredibly satisfying. I tasted both diet sodas over ice, one at a time. Then, I did the same straight from the can. To ensure I was comparing them as accurately as possible, I also went back and forth, taking sips side by side. The Summit Diet Cola had flavors that were audacious compared to Diet Coke. They went too far, became too artificial, and were too sweet. Instead of working together, the Summit Diet Cola came across as a battle for attention from one flavor to the next, while Diet Coke's flavor, carbonation, and sweetness all worked in tandem to complement and enhance each other's qualities. It would be one thing if rumors had said that this dupe was somewhat comparable. That I could see. Both sodas have a citrus component, an artificial sweetness, and a caramel aesthetic. However, Diet Coke remained subdued in all its flavors and maintained a refreshing quality that was enjoyable rather than complicated. Summit, on the other hand, was like a little kid dressing up in their parents' clothes, trying to be something it wasn't, and ending up as an obvious farce. Diet soda alternatives keep coming after Diet Coke. But I just don't believe that any of them will ever beat the OG. And why do we need them to? With the ability to get discounts or bulk amounts of Diet Coke, the savings are negligible. You just need to look around and see where you can find the best deal. To get the best taste, I feel it's more than worth it.
