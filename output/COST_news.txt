by Michael Levanduski Costco is a great company that offers some amazing deals if you shop smart. This TikToker, however, claims that some of their products are actually a rip off so you have to be careful. The video is him showing a four-pack of really nice-looking steaks with the caption, “Not everything is a good deal here. $69.41” It is crazy that four steaks, even strip lone steaks, cost that much nowadays. He starts talking and says, “$69 for four of these. No wonder why your mortgage isn’t paid.” He is right about that being expensive, but at least they will be delicious. He goes on to say, “I bought the same thing yesterday at Metro for $26.” Wow, I don’t have a Metro around me, but that sounds like a pretty insane deal. I’m wondering how Metro could sell them for such a low price. Maybe they aren’t the same cut or something. If they really are that much cheaper, I might have to start shopping around. Check out the full video and see what you think. You can see the video here: COSTCO OVERPRICED. #overpricedmeat ♬ original sound – P. The commenters are pretty skeptical. This commenter says that they don’t have good quality meat at Metro. Again, someone pointing out the quality difference. Apparently he posted a video of what he bought, and it was low-quality cuts. Some things are too good to be true. Now that you’ve read that story, check out this one about a delivery driver who took a $400 grocery order back because she wasn’t given a tip.

April 08, 2025 16:05 ET | Source: Mama’s Creations, Inc. Mama’s Creations, Inc. Fourth Quarter Revenues Increase 25.7% to $33.6 Million at 27.0% Gross Margin Profile Completion of Strategic CapEx Projects and New Senior Hires Driving Robust Revenue and Margin Growth EAST RUTHERFORD, NJ, April 08, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mama’s Creations, Inc. (Nasdaq: MAMA), a leading national marketer and manufacturer of fresh deli prepared foods, has reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended January 31, 2025. Financial Summary: Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2025 & Subsequent Operational Highlights: Management Commentary “The fourth quarter of 2025 was highlighted by a robust 25.7% revenue growth, to a record $33.6 million, and the highest quarterly gross margin for the fiscal year at 27.0%, with the completion of CapEx investments to double our grilled chicken throughput, positioning us for the next leg up in growth, as reflected in the market share gains we saw this quarter,” said Adam L. Michaels, Chairman and CEO of Mama’s Creations. “Construction-related disruptions at our Farmingdale facility that had been impacting gross margins were firmly behind us in September, putting us back on track toward our near-term target in the high 20% range. While commodities and tariffs continue to put pressure on the macroeconomic environment, we have positioned ourselves well in anticipation of potential future macro headwinds. With over half of our expected protein needs for the new fiscal year locked in via fixed-price agreements, we are better prepared than ever to weather any macro headwinds. “Emphasis on our 4 Cs – Cost, Controls, Culture and Catapult – during the quarter was supported by continued automation and operational efficiency improvements across the organization. This included the aforementioned CapEx investments that were completed in September, as well as labor cost savings through a new lower overtime staffing model that was fully implemented in January, and additional procurement efficiencies and recent upgrades to our existing grills that will drive meaningful improvements in throughput. We continue to focus on selling new products that leverage the entire chicken breast, which allows us to trim more often, creating a cycle of higher gross margins through significant cost savings. By mid-year, we expect to trim most of our chicken in-house, from a small minority today. “Taken together, we believe we now have the world-class operational asset base and team in place to fully optimize operations, execute on our Catapult growth plan and identify, acquire and integrate future M&A opportunities. With these strong fundamentals, we believe we are well-positioned to emerge as a dominant player and a consolidator in the prepared foods space. Our marketing has grown to capture new customers, cohorts and occasions, and our team is selling with confidence and fulfilling pent-up demand. This has driven the robust 19.4% growth we saw in fiscal 2025, nearly double last year’s growth, all while building the foundation for an even stronger fiscal 2026,” concluded Michaels. Fourth Quarter Fiscal 2025 Financial Results Revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 increased 25.7%, to $33.6 million, as compared to $26.7 million in the same year-ago quarter. Revenue for fiscal 2025 increased 19.4% to $123.3 million, as compared to $103.3 million in the prior year. The increase was largely attributable to volume gains driven by same-customer cross-selling of new items, high ROI trade promotions to drive higher velocities in existing customers and new customer door expansion. Targeted pricing actions were successfully put in place and implemented to ensure the Company maintained gross margin targets. Gross profit increased 16.1%, to $9.1 million, or 27.0% of total revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared to $7.8 million, or 29.3% of total revenues, in the same year-ago quarter. Gross profit increased 0.7% to $30.5 million, or 24.8% of total revenues, in fiscal 2025, as compared to $30.3 million, or 29.4% of total revenues, in the prior year. The difference in gross margin was primarily attributable to commodity cost increases from historical averages as well as a non-recurring impact from construction surrounding the now-completed installation of strategic CapEx projects at the Company’s Farmingdale, NY facility. Operating expenses totaled $7.2 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared to $5.9 million in the same year-ago quarter. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses decreased in the fourth quarter of 2025 to 21.3% from 21.9%. Operating expenses totaled $25.7 million in fiscal 2025, as compared to $21.4 million in fiscal 2024. As a percentage of sales, operating expenses remained flat in fiscal 2025 at 20.8% of sales. Operating expenses in the fourth quarter benefitted from increased operating leverage, partially offset by strategic new hires to build capabilities, as well as a 93% year-over-year increase in marketing spend across the entirety of the fiscal year – an area of historical underinvestment – to help drive repeatable and profitable growth. Net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 increased to $1.6 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $1.4 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, in the same year-ago quarter. Net income for fiscal 2025 totaled $3.7 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $6.5 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, in the prior year. Fourth quarter net income totaled 4.8% of revenue, as compared to 5.3% in the same year-ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, increased 8.7% to $3.1 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared to $2.8 million in the same year-ago quarter. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $9.2 million in fiscal 2025, as compared to $11.7 million in the prior year. Cash and cash equivalents as of January 31, 2025 totaled to $7.2 million, as compared to $11.0 million as of January 31, 2024. The change in cash and cash equivalents was primarily driven by $5.1 million in strategic capital investments and $3.6 million of debt paydown year-to-date, partially offset by working capital improvements. As of January 31, 2025, total debt stood at $5.1 million, as compared to $8.7 million as of January 31, 2024.

The company believes this non-GAAP measure, when considered together with the corresponding GAAP measures, provides useful information to investors and management regarding financial and business trends relating to the company’s results of operations. However, this non-GAAP measure has significant limitations in that it does not reflect all the costs and other items associated with the operation of the company’s business as determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, the company’s non-GAAP measures may be calculated differently and are therefore not comparable to similar measures by other companies. Therefore, investors should consider non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance in accordance with GAAP.

Title: American Consumers Are Resilient, Ready To Adapt To Tariff-Driven Price Increases

ByPamela N. Danziger ByPamela N. Danziger, Senior Contributor. Close-up on a woman shopping at a convenience store and checking her receipt while exiting As the stock market implodes in real time, American consumers are responding with a pragmatic acceptance of what’s coming, ready to adjust as necessary. Having already navigated a period of hyperinflation, they will apply the same shopping strategies they honed then to adapt to anticipated tariff-induced price increases. Since 2020, Americans have been on a roller coaster where prices are concerned. The consumer price index rose from an average of 1.2% in 2020 to 8% in 2022 then dropped to a still high 4.1% in 2023. Americans got a reprieve in 2024, ending at 2.9% and inflation dropped further to 2.8% in February. The Bureau of Labor Statistics will release the March inflation data in a few days. Shoppers adapted then – retail and food service reciepts rose from $7.4 trillion in 2021 to $8.5 trillion in 2024. And they will adapt now. “In a moment of economic tension, consumers’ quiet resilience may be the more important signal for brands to pay attention to,” said Natalie Griffith, director of cultural insights at research firm Collage, which just conducted a survey among 1,000+ Americans about the pending impact of tariffs. Overwhelmingly, consumers expect tariffs to impact prices, according to 76% of the 2000+ voters surveyed by Morning Consult for the National Retail Federation. While 37% believe governmental policies should cut the trade deficit, there is much broader support (75%) for the government to prioritize bringing down the cost of groceries and everyday goods this year. Yet, Americans are nearly equally divided as to whether the tariffs will hurt them a lot (38%) or hurt a little (31%), according to a survey among 1,645 consumer by YouGov for the Hoover Institution. However, consumers’ feelings break along demographic lines. Men tend to skew toward hurt a little (36%), while more women are in the hurt-a-lot camp (41%). And significantly more Black Americans expect tariffs to hurt them a lot (49%) versus White (35%) or Hispanics (36%). Notably, 14% in this survey are unsure. Nearly half of consumers believe they are already feeling the impact of tariffs on the prices they are paying, according to the Collage survey conducted in March before the tariffs were even announced. Experts say it will take a few weeks to months for price changes to show up at the cash register. Yet, a skeptical few (29%) believe that some companies have taken advantage of the current situation to raise prices and boost profits. For example, AutoZone CEO Phillip Daniele said in September’s earnings call that as tariff policies have “ebbed and flowed over the years,” that “we generally raise prices ahead of that.” Such anticipatory price increases are not a good idea and brands that do so will leave consumers with a bad taste in their mouths once the dust settles. “Tensions and resentment are high due to what many see as about to happen to the economy,” shared Collage’s Griffith. Given consumers’ anxieties, brands and retailers must work to calm fears and reduce consumer tension so they don’t negatively react as we are seeing Wall Street do now. The Collage survey found that 72% of consumers are already adjusting in anticipation of price increases. They are: In addition, they are delaying major purchases (23%), such as cars, electronics and appliances, stocking up before prices increase (22%) and buying second-hand goods (16%). These are value-hacking strategies that have served them well over the last few years. As McKinsey describes it, consumers are operating in a “value now” mode, not just shopping for the best price but choosing to optimize the value of their purchases. And by optimizing on day-to-day purchases, they can occasionally treat themselves, striking a balance between compromises and indulgences. The Collage survey confirms the “value now” approach. Some 53% of consumers said quality was extremely important when choosing between one product over another, compared with 48% who prioritize price. Brand reputation or trust also plays a leading role (30%), and so does their past experience with the brand (31%). In addition, over 70% say they are willing to pay more for higher-priced goods made in America – 40% if the price difference is small and 31% regardless of the price difference. “While we did find that patriotism is helping on the consumer side,” Griffith acknowledged, “it only applies if the value is clear and the product is superior. Quality and price still matter most.” As the “value-now” shopper adapts to the new tariff-shaped shopping economy, retailers and brands can alleviate sticker shock by being transparent and forthright about why prices are changing. “Consumers expect brands to be transparent about price hikes and nearly half said they’ll stay loyal if brands explain the ‘why’ and share some of the burden,” Griffith explains. Over 40% expect brands to absorb some of the increased costs instead of passing it all along to customers. For example, Walmart and Costco are leaning on Chinese suppliers to cut prices so they don’t have to burden their shoppers. And Chipotle has promised to keep prices level as long as possible even given the hit to avocado prices coming from Mexico. Offering discounts or promotions will help reinforce brand loyalty with 44% saying such incentives would make them more likely to continue purchasing. Ford is on it by offering employee discount prices to all new car buyers and Stellantis has followed suit for its Jeep, Ram and Chrysler brands. In uncertain times like these, the resilience and adaptability of American consumers will be on full display. “Consumers aren’t overreacting, but they are recalibrating,” Griffith said. Retailers and brands must do the same. They should find ways to minimize price hikes through supply chain efficiencies and selective pricing strategies. In other words, suck up some of the tariff costs, rather than passing them all along. By clearly and honestly explaining price changes, retailers and brands can reassure customers that their concerns are heard and their needs remain a priority. In these uncertain times, empathy is key — and by prioritizing customer needs, brands and retailers can foster trust and loyalty that will carry them through. See also:

Title: US consumers stockpile goods ahead of Trump’s new tariffs: ‘Preparing for the worst’

Pushing a shopping cart down the aisle of a Walmart Supercenter, Thomas Jennings, 53, loaded up on juices, condiments, and whatever he could think of. “I’m buying double of whatever – beans, canned goods, flour, you name it,” he said. His strategy is to stock up as much as possible before the Trump administration’s latest round of import tariffs takes effect on Wednesday. Earlier at Costco, Jennings bought flour, sugar, and water in bulk. “There’s a recession coming, and I am preparing for the worst,” he said. Like a growing number of U.S. shoppers, Jennings believes retail prices will soon rise because of Trump’s tariffs. The Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan, nonprofit research group, said the new levies will cost Americans $3.1 trillion over the next 10 years, amounting to a roughly $2,100 tax increase per household in 2025 alone. Even as many shoppers take a wait-and-see approach, some fear that any panic would trigger a stockpiling frenzy that intensifies on expectations of even worse inflation, they told Reuters. Manish Kapoor, founder of GCG, a supply chain management firm outside Los Angeles, said the tariffs are reawakening fears of empty store shelves encountered during the pandemic, when supply chain disruptions led to product shortages and inflation. “We saw this during COVID as well, where everybody frantically went and grabbed everything on store shelves, whether they needed it or not,” Kapoor said. “It’s not to that level, but people are worried that the cost (of goods) is going to go up and, you know, let’s stock up.” Walmart and Costco did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Angelo Barrio, 55, a retired garment industry professional, said Trump’s tactics of “muddying the water and causing chaos” have worried him and his friends about the economy’s direction. Barrio began buying goods with long shelf lives in November as he feared retailers would pass on tariff costs to their customers. At Costco this week, he stocked up on Crest toothpaste, soap, water, and rice to fill six canisters already stuffed with canned goods in his temperature-controlled basement. At Walmart, he grabbed two more bottles of olive oil, bringing his total stockpile to 20 bottles. “You can never be sure how much you’ll need,” he said. Barrio is sympathetic towards China, which Trump threatened on Monday with an additional 50% tariff if Beijing does not withdraw its retaliatory tariffs on the United States. “They are simply getting penalized for no fault of their own,” he said. “I have always been happy that they are able to provide us things at such low prices.” US stocks jump as trading partners rush to negotiate with Trump on tariffs Maggie Collins, who is in her mid-60s, said she is “shaking in my boots” as she worries about Trump’s tariffs and their impact on senior citizens. At a Walmart in North Bergen, New Jersey, Collins filled her cart with items like shower gels and sanitary pads, favoring Walmart brands that are cheaper than those from Procter & Gamble and Unilever. “I look at all the prices closely because I live on a fixed income,” said Collins, a health aide at a senior living facility. “Paying a higher price somewhere means making adjustments to some other budget.” On a recent visit to Shoprite, where Collins bought chopped meat to cook for her grandchildren, her typical 3 lb (1.36 kg) meat purchase cost $16, forcing her to take the $8 version instead. How would the younger generation cope, she wondered. “They are just getting out into this world where it has become so tough to survive.” At Valley Subaru in Longmont, Colorado, business has spiked in recent weeks. General Sales Manager Nic Chuenchit said he was unsure how much of that was due to consumers’ concerns about the 25% tariffs, which took effect on fully imported cars on April 3. “Customers are talking about the tariffs; customers are asking us questions about them,” Chuenchit said. “I do think some of our customers who were planning to buy a car have done it sooner rather than later because of the talk about tariffs.” Chuenchit was optimistic as he recalled selling cars after the 2008 recession and during the pandemic. “This business is resilient. Car sales have always been there,” he said. “People will still buy cars, even if there are tariffs. It’s just going to cost consumers more.” Advertisement

Introduction to Bitcoin Lecture Video Super pumped to share with you, my first full length lecture on an introduction to bitcoin, the bitcoin Revolution, and also this edited transcript that I provided for you! What to become: STOIC VLOG Something I have been meaning to write or create or do is like some sort of book, ebook, pamphlet, or introductory primer to stoicism. I really think that stoicism is probably one of the most useful and philosophical models to live normal every day real life. Yet, I haven’t really found a good instructional guide on it, especially when I was self teaching it to myself. Consider this a practical primer, cutting through the BS: Stoicism, stoic, the stoa in ancient Greece– essentially the stoa was like some sort of portico, patio, pillar, outside, essentially a spot where guys would just hang out, talk shop, talk philosophy, etc. ￼ ￼ I think about the show “Hey Arnold” in which I was raised with… the notion of “stoop kid“, the notion of a stoop is that in a lot of cities, especially the east coast in New York, you have this little stoop or porch, stairs that go outside your front door… and you could just hang out there, engage in social and neighborhood life etc. One of my happiest moments was when I was living in Providence Rhode Island, and then COVID-19 hit. Everything was closed, besides the park. I can still go to the park, hang out, workout, do chin ups– I learned how to do muscle ups, more bodyweight calisthenics stuff, and also… I had a lot of fun with this “rock toss“ challenge and workout… in the middle of the park was a huge ass rock and huge ass stone, and every single day I would go there pick it up, and then eventually work out with it; throwing it around for fun, doing overhead presses with it, clean and jerks, squats, and eventually I would just throw it around for fun. Funny enough it might have been the most fit I was in my life… this was the true “functional” fitness. The inspiration — Hector lifting an insanely massive stone (barely 2 strong men could lift it)… using it to break down the door of the ships of the other side. Anyways, the reason why that period of covid was so good is that it was in the middle of beautiful Providence Rhode Island summer, so nice and bright and warm and lovely… and one of the good things was going to the park was like an open forum, a new anatheum for a lot of really cool guys to come, hang out, talk shop, go topless and shirtless, workout and hang out. I met some really interesting people during that period of time. I met some guys who were really cool. For example, one guy I met was in the US military Navy, I think he was training to be a Navy seal or Delta force or something. Another guy in some sort of ROTC training, another cool guy from the hood, and also I would say I probably met half a dozen friendly drug dealers there. And of course a lot of people who believed in conspiracy theories; really friendly, a little weird, but overall good guys. Anyways, one of the biggest benefits of hanging out at that outdoor park, open air, nothing but green grass, the beautiful sun and the fitness equipment was that I think having this sort of open air environment is actually very conducive to socializing, thinking and thought, and pro social behavior. My theory about a lot of modern day antisocial behavior has to do with the structures which enclose us. For example, almost universally most guys at the gym are extremely antisocial. Why? My theory is that because most gyms have closed, cramped narrow ceilings, and do not have access to natural light, or outside space. Cramped indoor spaces promote antisocial behavior. The only good gym I went to which was interesting was the golds gym in Venice, which has this really big outdoor workout area. I think this is much more natural and more fun and better; to be able to work out directly outside outdoors, with your shirt off. Stoics, stoicism — it was originally I think codified by this guy named Zeno, and over time he picked up some followers. Essentially the whole thing happened organically; Zeno would first share his thinking on philosophy ethics and pragmatic ways to deal with other people and the downsides of life, he built a following, and then his followers would propagate the thoughts and start their own little schools of thoughts, their own little stoic clubs. Would I like about stoicism is how loosey goosey it is. It is kind of like zen, or taoism… it is not really quantified as a religion, or a strict moral order. In fact, a lot of the ancients stoics would meditate on random stuff like cosmology, natural sciences like Seneca, how volcanoes worked or whatever. I think nowadays in today’s world, we focus primarily on the pragmatic side; how to deal with fear, uncertainty, downsides etc. ￼I think I might’ve first learned about stoicism from Nassim Taleb and his ANTIFRAGILE book. I was curious, and my curiosity went to deep. To quote NASSIM TALEB and the Venetian saying “The ocean goes deeper, the deeper you wade into it.” I literally consumed every single book I could find on stoicism, even the obscure ones. Funny enough, a lot of the stoic thinkers tried to claim other philosophers as being stoic, like Seneca did with Diogenes the cynic. ￼ Cynic, cynicism, actually comes from the word canine, the dog. Diogenes was considered the “dog” philosopher, first used as a pejorative, but ultimately Diogenes reappropriated that title for fun! He saw dogs as tough, almost like wild wolves, rather than seeing them as a negative thing. Even Achilles when he was raging against king Agamemnon, he called him “dog faced“ as a heaping insult. First, Seneca. Seneca the younger, his dad was called Seneca the elder. In fact, this is such a big deal because Cindy and I named our first son, Seneca, directly after the stoic philosopher. This is true soul in the game; if you name your kid after your favorite philosopher, certainly it is a sign that you really liked that philosopher, or found them impactful. ￼￼￼The reason why I really like Seneca the stoic philosopher is because he had real connections to real reality. What that means is he wasn’t just on the sidelines; he actually existed in the real world, engaged in real politics, was even advisor to the emperor Nero, the bad one, who eventually low-key coerced Seneca to commit suicide, in a manly, dignified manner. I think this was because maybe… there was actually a plan to overthrow Nero, and essentially Nero found out. ￼ I really like Seneca because his writing is accessible, practical and pragmatic, and interesting. A lot of thinkers tend to lack connections to real reality, I have no tolerance for boring philosophers to talk about metaphysics, which is things which are not physical. Like thoughts ideas, the universe, electricity and energy, strange phenomenon and conspiracy theories on ghosts, “energy” whatever. ￼￼For a long time, I would hear the term “metaphysics” being thrown around, and I had zero idea what it actually meant. ￼ Meta– on top of. Or nestled within. Physics — the physical, physical phenomenon like gravity, first principles. The reason why metaphysics philosophers tend to be a bunch of losers is that they are all weak and anemic, nerds or geeks or weaklings who seem to have some sort of physiological degeneracy, which encourages them to opine or talk or think about impractical things, superficial things. Personally speaking, I think philosophy must be practical. ￼￼￼￼ Practical, praxis, ￼practice — to do! I have a very funny ideal; the general idea is that your body looks like a demigod, and your physiology is out of control. The general idea is one must be tall, strong, highly muscular, low body fat percentage, I’m not exactly sure what my body fat percentage is, but maybe it’s around 5%. ￼￼Also, physical fitness is critical to any stoic. My ideal is to walk 50 miles a day, eat 20 pounds of meat like Milo of Croton a day. And also, abstinence from silly things like media, alcohol, drugs, marijuana etc. Trust no thinker who does drugs! Even our best friend Nietzsche said that coffee was bad, because it would make people dark and gloomy. He encouraged 100% cocoa powder instead. ￼￼￼ Simple technique: First, look at a picture or a portrait or a full body shot, ideally topless of the artist, philosopher or thinker or individual… then judge their thoughts later. Why? My theory is this: the thoughts of an individual is hugely affected by their bodily physiology. For example, an extreme example: if somebody is locked inside a solitary confinement cell, and not permitted to go outside for years, but, he had a pen and pad and would jot down some thoughts… Would be the quality of these thoughts? Certainly dark and morose. In today’s world, why does it matter, what is the significance of stoicism, etc.? First and foremost, I think we are living in a troubling time, especially with the advent of modern day internet based media and advertising. I think 99% of what is propagated on the internet is fear mongering, and what is hate? Hate is just fear. The first thought on stoicism is that it is just fear conquering. What I discovered about street photography, is that 99% of it is conquering your fears. Conquering your fears of upsetting other people, getting in some sort of verbal or physical altercation etc. In fact my bread and butter workshop is my conquering your fears and street photography workshop, the workshop which is still interesting to me even after a decade. Why is this so important? I think it is rooted in almost everything; conquering your fears is rooted in entrepreneurship, innovation, risktaking and real life. Even my speculation in crypto. 99.9% of crypto speculation is just balls. Having the balls to make big bets, and when things go south, knowing how to master your emotions. A simple extra I have is this: just imagine it will all go down to zero. It was useful because when I was in college, my sophomore year I got really into trading stocks, and I eventually lost my whole life savings, maybe around $3500 USD, and some bad penny stock which I actually misread the financials… the whole time I thought the company was making a profit, but actually it was taking a loss. I actually didn’t know that if profits are written in parentheses, it means a loss. It was funny because my initial start as an investor was back in high school, I bought some Adobe stock when I was a high school junior, and also some mutual funds, which both went up after about 4-5 years. ￼Also I remember in elementary school computer class, when I was in the sixth grade in Bayside Queens, there was some sort of stock stimulation trading game, and actually it was funny… the kids who made the most money and were the most successful just put 100% of everything into Apple, note this is when we were only 12 years old, and I was born in 1988. ￼Funny enough, it seems that stoicism actually plays well with capitalism. Why? According to modern day capitalist thinking, the best way to approach life is to be objective, strong, stoic, unemotional, logical and rational. Also, ￼with modern day media there is so much fear mongering in the news, about some sort of global armageddon, global financial ruin, etc. I call it “fear porn”. Therefore stoicism as a mindset is useful to think and position your mind in such a way that you could consider that life is all upside, no downside. In fact, if I could summarize stoicism in one sentence, it is that life is all upside, no downside. Inspired by NASSIM TALEB. So, is stoicism useful to you if you’re a man or a woman? Does it matter? The good thing is I think it could apply to both sexes. Conquering sexism and social pressures is useful if you’re woman, and also if you’re a man. Also, gender is social. Lot of the expectations set on us by society is socialized and gamed to a certain degree. First, we got to unchain ourselves from modern day ethics and morality. I believe that all modern day philosophy and thinking and ethics and religion is bad. For example, the notion of turning the other cheek is a patently bad one. Why did Jesus turn his cheek? It is because he lacked on army. Also, philosophically I think we should put no trust in Socrates. ￼￼￼I thought which has puzzled me for a long time was this “Why was Socrates so ugly? Monster in face, monster in soul. I think Socrates was a degenerate, and he lacked any sort of real power. Therefore he turned logic and rationality into his terrorizing weapon (via Nietzsche). Back in the day, you didn’t need logic or rationality to have things your way, you simply was able to dictate that which you wanted to pause it, because you had a military force behind you. Just think about Machiavelli and IL PRINCIPE– the reality of being a mercurial prince, king, and military leader is hard, stoic, “immoral”. But ultimately it all comes down to war, conquest, the military. Trust nobody who uses rationality or logic as their tyrannizing weapon. ￼ In fact, I believe that all should have the body and strength of some sort of super soldier. Essentially look like all the guys from the movie 300, this is our ideal. Demigod physique. ￼ And this is the true courage of Kanye West; he literally put everything on the line, and even lost his spouse and I think maybe his kids? All for the sake of revealing inequities. ￼ “I throw these Maybach keys fucking c’est la ￼vie! I know that we the new slaves.”￼- Ye The fun thing about stoicism is that you could just make it up as you go, devise your own strategies and whatever. “Fucking c’est la vie!” My favorite Kanye West line. Essentially the general idea is that in life, one should not take things too seriously. Laughter is golden, I forget the philosopher who was called the laughing philosopher… Democritus?; better to laugh about the follies of human beings rather than to be dark and morose about it. Also, thoughts from the Odyssey; if you look far enough ￼ into the future, everything becomes comedic and hilarious. So when you’re in some sort of bad situation, just think to yourself “Perhaps one day, 20 or 30 years from now… I will look back at this and just laugh!” It will just be humorous. Honestly, laughter, and kind of being able to joke about things might be the best way to live life and deal with setbacks. ￼ Problems in modern day life: A funny thing I have learned is that when you call something something, it isn’t that. For example, if someone calls something a “luxury car”, it ain’t. For example, a true modern day luxury car is maybe a Tesla, but Tesla never calls itself a luxury car. Also the ultimate luxury technology company is probably Apple… but Apple is very intelligent and not calling themselves a luxury brand. A pro tip is when it comes to websites, read the alternative text, the header text, the stuff that shows up in the tab of your browser window. If the website, the automotive retailer tries to market themselves as a “luxury” brand, typically it is actually a sign that it isn’t a luxury brand it isn’t luxury brand. Thought: what are some good examples of true luxury brands which don’t overly calls itself luxury? ￼￼ In someways, we can think and consider stoicism as our new luxury. In fact, having luxury, luxury of mind and soul… and luxury of freedom of speech, isn’t this the ultimate luxury? When somebody asked Diogenes the cynic; “What is the best human good”? He said “Freedom of speech, speaking your mind, having the power to see whatever is on your mind.” In fact, my current joy is becoming more and more free talking, and free riding. What that means is this; I’m ain’t going to censor myself no more, even if I might be politically incorrect insensitive or whatever. ￼ Also, I would prefer to speak my mind and seriously hurt the feelings of others, rather than soften it for the sake of the other person. ￼￼￼Similarly speaking, when people call themselves “influencers”, they are not influencers. Ultimately I think we should think of stoicism just like having another tool inside our tool kit. For example, if you’re a chef, you’re going to have different knives for different purposes. If you’re going to cut a big piece of meat, you probably want a big ass meat cutting knife, not something you would use to slice an apple with. Similarly speaking, if you’re going to scoop out the insides of an avocado, better to use a spoon rather than using a fork, or a knife. ￼ I think the problem is when some people get too into stoicism (I prefer writing stoicism with a lowercase￼), they think that everything needs to be consistent, and must fit into this nice little neat box of what is considered “stoicism“. This is a bad line of thinking… let us consider that Marcus Aurelius never even mentioned stoicism in his writings, his collections of thoughts, which we moderns call THE MEDITATIONS… it was just essentially his personal diary, to help him conquer his own personal fears and thoughts, I don’t think he ever intended it to be published publicly. I think he just wrote it to himself as self therapy. And I think the only stoic philosopher he even mentions is maybe Epictetus. For myself, I just come out with certain to work out thoughts and techniques because it helps me, and when I find these tricks or techniques or secret hacks or cheat codes… My passion is to simply share it with others. ￼￼￼￼ And ultimately, things are ever in flux and evolving and changing and adapting. For example, I’ve discovered the quality of my thinking is different when I am in Culver City Los Angeles, compared to being in the boring suburbs of Orange County. Also depending on my social environments… my stoic thoughts are different when I am in a gym, vs just working out by myself in my parking spot in the back of my apartment. Also, the quality of my thoughts is different when living with family members or other people versus just living with myself Cindy and Seneca. Assuming you’re not growing your own vegetables and living in the middle of nowhere… you probably have some interaction with other human beings. As long as you have an iPhone, an Android phone, a smartphone, a 4G or 5G internet connection, wifi, a laptop, have to buy groceries somewhere… you’re still going to have to interact with other human beings. And this is good. There is no other greater joy than other human beings. In fact, modern-day society is strange because in someways, the ethos is to be antisocial and to be cowardly. But in fact, the best way to think about things is that real life is interaction with other human beings, and social conquest. One can imagine a lot of modern day entrepreneurship as simply a big dick swinging contest. He who is the most masculine confident tall and strong and stoic shall win. Assume that everyone is mentally insane: Have you ever been out in public, and you see some sort of crackhead or strange homeless person who acts radically, smells terrible, and is obviously mentally ill? Do you hate them for it? When they say something weird to you… do you take it personally? No. Why? They are crazy. Perhaps we should just adopt this stoic mindset towards other people; some people are actually physiologically ill, mentally unwell… don’t trust the opinion of nobody. A lot of people are trying to actually deal with their own inner demons: For example, becoming the successful photographer and street photographer I am today… I’ve dealt with some individuals who would say anonymous bad things about me, and later I found out that their mom just died or something. I cannot imagine what it feels like losing a mother… therefore if somebody spew some hate on me because something bad happened to them, I’m not gonna take it personally. ￼￼￼￼￼Self-flagellation: I think a lot of people who are sick, mentally or physiologically self flagellate themselves. Essentially the way that they deal with other people or themselves is some sort of metaphorical self-flagellation. For example… you know those strange individuals who have the whip and whip themselves, and inflict pain on themselves? I think some people do this metaphorically to themselves and others. You just want to stay away from them. My personal theory on fear is that a lot of it is tied to morality and ethics. I think the general idea is not necessarily that we are afraid of anything… I think the true fear is that we’re afraid that we are some sort of bad evil unethical immoral person. For example in street photography, the general ethical thought is that it is immoral to take a photo of somebody without their permission, because there is some sort of it inherent evil behind it. Is this true? No. Taking photos and not really a big deal. I think it is because some people are just overly sensitive, which once again comes from some sort of physiological weakness. For example, if you’re a weightlifter who could lift 1000 pounds, assuming you’re not taking any steroids or anything… are small things going to bother you? No. But let us assume that you are a skinny fat man, all you do is drink alcohol and smoke marijuana and watch Netflix, and you spent too much time on Reddit… you are 40% body fat, and have never lifted in your life. And also your testosterone is low and you never go outside. Certainly the quality of your thoughts is going to be different than if you’re a happy gay monster, lifting weights outside in the direct sun, laughing and having fun. ￼￼￼ In fact, I’ve actually personally discovered that the reason why a lot of people hate me is because I am so happy jovial and gay. They are secretly suspicious or envious of me? ￼ Probably one of my worst experiences was this jarring transition; I was super happy insanely happy being in Vietnam in 2017; with a beautiful weather, the beautiful light, the happy people the great amenities etc.… and then that winter Cindy and I went to Europe, in Marseille Berlin and Prague, and maybe London… seriously the worst winter of my life. Why? I wonder if so much miserable feelings and thoughts simply comes from the darkness and lack of light. a lot of Europe is actually quite miserable; dark, unhygienic, morose. Even Nietzsche had a thought about Schopenhauer; How much of these emo European philosophers came from the fact that it was just complaining about the cold weather in Germany etc.?￼￼For myself, my ideal weather is Southeast Asia; I love being in Phnom Penh Cambodia, Vietnam etc. In the states, am I the only one who loves living in Los Angeles? Dr. Dre and Kendrick Lamar said that LA was the best for women weed and weather… I would definitely say the biggest upside of living in Los Angeles is the light, the sunlight. It actually does get quite cold here, but usually most reliably even in December during the winter time, the sun will always come up. As long as there is bright sunny light, I will be happy. And I think maybe for myself, considering that I am a photographer, and photography means painting with light… light for me is critical. I also wonder how much of it is a physiological thing and a genetic trait; for example I could even recall being a young child, and my mom telling me that the most critical thing in finding a home or an apartment was light and natural light. Even now… 90% of my happiness comes from being able to ￼have access to natural light, ideally floor to ceiling windows facing directly the sun, having some sort of modern temperature regulated apartment and home. Even living in our tiny studio minimalistic luxury apartment in Providence Rhode Island, where it was always 75° warm and cozy, and not frigid and damp and cold and dark and humid… I was always good. But moving to an older house, where it always felt damp and cold… this literally lowered my happiness by 1000%. Therefore, if you’re feeling miserable sad or whatever… I say spend three months living in Hanoi or Saigon in Vietnam, or go to Phnom Penh Cambodia. I wonder if 90% of peoples misery is simply due to the weather. ￼￼”Better to be a gay monster than a sentimental bore!” – Fernandino Galliani, via Nietzsche My stoic ideal is somebody who is happy, gay, smiling, no headphones or AirPods on, no sunglasses on, no hat, no facial hair, no baggy oversized clothing, no tint in their car. Somebody who makes great eye contact, laughs, stands up upright, jokes, and fools around. Like an overgrown child. ￼Also, lift weights at least once every day, ideally in the direct sun. Just buy some weightlifting equipment on Titan.fitness, I like the farmers carry handles, the Olympic loadable dumbbell, and also the Texas power squat bar. Just buy some cheap weights, and or buy a heavy 400 pound sandbag, and just have fun throwing it around. A true stoic should look something like Hercules or Achilles. Or like ERIC KIM; I have the aesthetic and the physique of Brad Pitt in FIGHT CLUB except with a lot more muscle. Like my friend Soren says, the Adonis physique and proportions. I think a real stoic is sexy, happy and fun. Who doesn’t take life too seriously; and think of everything like a fun game. A real stoic would be joyful and cheery like three-year-old child without any adulteration from the outside world. I don’t like talking with or hanging out with adults, uninteresting. At what point or age do people become so emo? Typically, highschoolers are very optimistic. Even college students. But I think at least in maybe college in high school nowadays… the bad trend is towards “over concern”, about the world the planet ethics animals etc. I find a lot of this thinking superficial, performative, and uncritical. I think “animal rights“, “saving the planet” is this new pseudo world religion; which is just capitalism 3.0. I find the whole pet industry the whole dog industry to be insanely bizarre, and I trust nobody who talks about “saving the planet“ who owns an iPhone, owns any sort of car, or has an Amazon prime subscription. Certainly not any vegans. Animals are animals. They are lower on the hierarchy and totem pole on earth. Man is the apex predator, the apex bully and the apex tyrant. Should we care for animals or “animal rights”? No. Animals are our slaves. If you consider even dogs and pets… they are essentially our emotional slaves. People talk a lot about the virtuosity of dogs being loyal or whatever… and giving you unconditional love. This seems like some sort of emotional slavery. The only dogs I respect are some sort of canine dogs, some sort of attack or defense dogs, or hunting dogs. For example, John Wick 3; Halle Barry and her dogs. An animal should either be a weapon, or nothing. Essentially it looks like men no longer have a backbone. No more spine. I trust nobody who owns a dog. Let us not forget; they call it dog ownership, or “owning a pet”. There is no more concept of “human ownership, or “owning a human.”￼￼￼ What is the end goal of humanity? To me it is towards entrepreneurship, innovation, art and aesthetics, philosophy etc. Design. Stoicism should be considered a tool which could aid you in these things. For example, I think 99% of entrepreneurship is courage. Stoicism could help you with that. I also think with design, great design is also 99% courage, having the courage to attempt something that won’t sell or be received well… stoicism is all about practical courage. The only designers with courage include Steve Jobs, Jony Ive, Elon Musk, Kanye West. ￼ Also, weightlifting. To attempt to lift a certain weight you have never attempted before takes great courage. For example, me atlas lifting 1000 pounds; that is 10 plates and a 25 on each side, ￼￼￼this is true stoic training. Why? The fear of injury is what holds most people back; if you had successfully conquered this fear and not injured yourself, this is pure stoic bliss. I think the only and the only proper way to lift weights is one repetition maximum training. That is; what is the maximum amount of weight you’re able to successfully lift or move, even half an inch? To me, the courage is the success. Even if you had the courage to attempt it… that is what is considered success. ￼￼ Simple exercises to do include the atlas lift, innovated by ERIC KIM, or a one repetition max rack pull. Or, a high trap bar deadlift, heavy Farmer’s walks, or heavy sandbag carries. Or even a simple thing you could do is go to the park or to the local nature center, find the biggest rock there and just see if you could pick it up. If you’re interested in stoicism, and have had some interesting thoughts on stoicism, one of the most noble things you could do is start your own blog. I think blogs are 1000 times more effective than publishing some sort of static printed book; I think the problem in today’s world is that everyone is seeking some sort of legitimacy by being picked up by some sort of legitimate publisher and getting “published“, and seeing your printed book at Barnes & Noble whatever. I say it is better to be open source, free and permissionless, ￼￼￼decentralized. Just publish your thoughts and book as a free PDF, and just host it on dropbox, Google Drive, or your own web server. Share the link freely, and also just publish the raw text as a big blog post. ￼ Even Sam Bankman-Fried wisely thought; 99.9% of books could just be summarized as big blog posts. Don’t trust any modern day published book which isn’t free, because… there is some sort of hidden clout chasing somewhere. ￼ Even one of the worst compromises that led to the demise of Ray Dalio was the fact that he took his Principles book, which was essentially a free ebook PDF on his website, and then took it off, because I think he got a book deal with Simon and Schuster. After he did that, he lost my respect. If you’re already independently wealthy, and you don’t crowd source your self-esteem… why would you need to externally validate yourself by getting some sort of constipated publisher and annoying editor? Editors are bad. Start your own blog and start blogging your own thoughts on stoic philosophy, and even start a YouTube channel and start vlogging on it. ￼￼My generalized thought is simple: if your thought your idea your blog post your video or whatever could even impact the life of one other human being on planet earth… it is worth it.

Title: Vaio is advertising ‘tariff free’ laptop prices for a limited time

When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. Unless you’re a real stickler for the finer points of the consumer tech industry, you might not know the history of the Vaio laptop series. But to miss the chaos unfolding from the Trump administration’s massive tariffs, you’d have to be living under a rock, under a penguin, on an uninhabited island in the Indian Ocean. The current owner of Vaio is leveraging this chaos to sell a few “tariff free” laptops. To address the first point: Yes, Vaio (stylized VAIO) laptops are still a thing, originally launched by Sony back in 1996 but spun off into an independent Japanese manufacturer when Sony exited the laptop business about a decade ago. It’s currently majority-owned by Japanese retailer Nojima. At the moment, Vaio offers three different series—the SX, SX-R, and FS—in 14-inch and 16-inch sizes. The designs are unremarkable and don’t often get spotted even on big retailers, but it looks like they’re getting some love from Costco as a US sales partner. According to Tom’s Hardware, the Vaio brand sent out emails to some customers hoping to lure them in with “Tariff Free Inventory.” While it doesn’t go into specifics, this is undoubtedly a reference to US president Donald Trump’s latest round of tariffs on nearly every country that supplies finished goods and raw materials to the United States. This sent stock prices and other economic indicators into a tailspin, in what’s already being referred to as “the 2025 stock market crash.” For the Japanese Vaio brand, which manufactures all its current models in a Nagano factory, the relevant tariff is the 24 percent tax on products from Japan, according to Reuters. Depending on how the tariffs are implemented on specific components, the 34 percent tax on goods from China and 32 percent tax on goods from Taiwan may also come into play for laptops sold in the US. In the best-case scenario, Vaio’s cheapest laptop at the moment will jump from $1,100 to $1,364, assuming Vaio passes the cost directly onto retailers and final buyers. For the SX-R mentioned in the “tariff free” email, the starting price would jump from $2,200 to $2,728 for the same model. For more estimations on how tariffs will affect consumer electronics prices, check out this breakdown. The prices on the Vaio website as of April 7th don’t seem to have changed much since January, as seen on the Internet Archive. It seems like a safe assumption that Vaio is promoting prices for current inventory held within the United States, which can be sold at today’s prices without fear of tariffs affecting profitability. It’ll be a few weeks before the latest round of tariffs imposed on goods being imported to the United States start impacting finished items being sold to consumers. If you’re in the market for a new laptop in the US, you might want to look for one right away. As Vaio demonstrates, there’s only a limited amount of computers in current supply line that can be sold at pre-Trump prices.

With 272 miles of range and more room inside its walls than your first apartment, GM’s Chevy Brightdrop electric van is one of the best commercial EVs you can buy. And if you’re a Costco Executive member, you can get one for yourself or your business with an absolutely incredible $31,500 discount. (!) Fleet electrification expert Tony Nisam took to LinkedIn yesterday to post a deal that he ran across at a Washington State Costco that stacks a $25,500 manufacturer rebate with $3,000 in “regular” Costco Member Savings, $2,750 in “LIMITED-TIME” Manufacturer to Member Incentives, plus an additional $250 for Costco Executive members. Do a bit of math (add up 25,500 + 3,000 + $2,750 + 250), and you’ll calculate an almost unheard of $31,500 discount on one of the best, most capable commercial vans on the market – ICE or electric. And that’s before you factor in the 0% interest financing (72 mo.) being advertised at Blade Chevrolet, the Mount Vernon, Washington, where VIN 2G58J2TY6S9104313 (the exact van shown, below) is shown as stock number 16757. If you’re not a Costco member yet and you’re looking for a new truck for your business or even a unique #vanlife ride with zero emissions, modern tech, and a nationwide dealer network, GM makes that $130 Executive membership seem like a no-brainer. “But wait,” says the floating, disembodied ghost of the great Billy Mays. “There’s more!” In addition to the $31,500 worth of discounts Costco Executive members get, there are deals to be had on chargers AND a number of other state and local utility incentives your business might qualify for, bringing the cost of adding a new Chevy Brightdrop to your fleet even lower. In northern Illinois, for example, ComEd commercial customers can get up to $7,500 in rebates for a new Brightdrop Zevo van. Is a $39,000 price cut enough to get you to take a look at a new Brightdrop? At $45,235 (from a starting price of $84,235), can you afford not to? Head down to the comments and let us know.
