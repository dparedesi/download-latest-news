Costco (COST) is scheduled to report its Fiscal Q1 results on December 12th, after the closing bell. The wholesale giant has been one of the most successful retail stocks of 2024 and has maintained strong performance for several years. As earnings day approaches, I see no reason for this trend to be interrupted. To be clear, my bullish outlook on COST is rooted in fundamental factors such as its steady, profitable membership-based model—a rare advantage for a non-tech company—and its ability to weather periods of economic softness better than most retailers.

Make smarter investments with weekly expert stock picks from the Smart Investor Newsletter In this article, I’ll provide a recap of Costco’s recent performance, highlight what might stand out in Fiscal Q1, and explain why, despite its relatively high valuation, I believe Costco is well-positioned to continue its upward trajectory. In early September, Costco released its Fiscal Q4 results. While the company’s top-line performance fell short of market expectations, its strong profitability results helped justify the bullish outlook. Costco’s net sales for the quarter totaled $78.2 billion, a 1% increase year-over-year, but came in below the $79.91 billion expected by analysts. This miss was primarily due to membership fees, which reached $1.51 billion, reflecting a 6.5% year-over-year increase. Although there was a slight decline in renewal rates in the U.S. and Canada—falling to 92.5% from 93% in Q4—this was attributed to an online promotion that brought in about 2,000 new users, leading to the small drop in membership renewals. Despite this, Costco’s bullish momentum remained intact. While the top line missed expectations, the bottom line exceeded them significantly. Costco reported non-GAAP EPS of $5.29 per share, outperforming analyst estimates of $5.07, marking an 8.8% year-over-year increase. Given that Costco has managed to grow its bottom line faster than its revenue and has increased membership fees for the first time since 2017, this should contribute to higher profitability in Q1. As a result, the positive trend is expected to continue in the coming quarters. Looking ahead to Costco’s upcoming Fiscal Q1 results, I believe that the favorable outlook should hold if the company continues to report membership increases, which is arguably the main driving force behind the company’s investment thesis. To begin with, Costco registered 76.2 million paid memberships in Fiscal Q4, growing at 7.3% year-over-year. This was a very similar growth rate to Q3 when it registered an increase of 7.8%. It is worth noting that over half of Costco’s profitability depends on membership fees. Indeed, the firm generated $4.82 billion in memberships that were essentially pure profit. Given that Costco’s total operating income is $9.29 billion, I believe that profitability will continue to rise if memberships keep growing. And speaking of profitability, the numbers that Costco has to beat in Q1 are earnings of $3.78 per share on revenue of $62.38 billion, which equate to year-over-year growth rates of 5.6% and 7.83%, respectively. Interestingly, Costco reported a 6.9% growth in adjusted comparable sales during the last quarter, which was probably the best market share gain in the consumer staples industry. I believe this proves that Costco’s value offering does very well in all environments where value-seeking increases. And I see no reason not to believe that the trend of strong sales comps shouldn’t also prove strong in Fiscal Q1, thus sustaining organic growth and maintaining operational efficiency. As is often the case, the primary risk to Costco’s bullish thesis remains well-known to investors: the stock tends to trade at a significant premium compared to most of its peers. Currently, Costco trades at a 54.6x forward P/E ratio, a valuation that can largely be attributed to qualitative factors such as strong management, high customer loyalty, and the company’s business model. Given that much of Costco’s profitability stems from a hyper-loyal network of members who pay a fee, there is a general consensus that the company’s financial performance will remain robust regardless of the consumer environment, which reduces the perceived risk for investors. However, the high valuation raises concerns for many investors. Paying 54 times earnings for a company may seem excessive, even if Costco can manage to grow its earnings by 10% annually. At that growth rate, it would still take roughly 20 years to recoup the investment at this valuation—a lengthy period for a consumer staples and discretionary business. As Costco heads into Fiscal Q1, this is clearly not an opportunity to capitalize on any weakness, given that the stock is trading at all-time highs. This, understandably, raises concerns for investors about whether they’re overpaying for the stock. While COST may be vulnerable to short-term pressure if minor setbacks occur, such as a dip in membership growth or slower sales, any corrections would likely be a response to stretched valuations. That said, in the long-term, as long as Costco maintains its current business model—particularly with membership fees contributing more than half of its profits and with renewal rates consistently above 90%—I believe that the stock will continue to trend upward. At TipRanks, the consensus among Wall Street analysts for COST is a Moderate Buy, with 18 out of 26 analysts being bullish on the stock, while eight remain neutral. The average price target is $957, which implies a downside risk of -3.42% based on the latest share price. See more COST analyst ratings I rate Costco stock as a Buy heading into its Fiscal Q1 earnings, although I acknowledge that any potential hiccups in comparable sales, revenue growth, or membership renewal rates could put pressure on the stock, given its stretched valuation. However, I don’t believe such pressure would have a lasting effect beyond the short term. While Costco’s stock may appear to have limited upside at its current valuation, even with favorable results, it remains a solid defensive pick for long-term investors. The company’s business model—built on high volume, low margins, and strong membership retention—drives steady profit growth across various consumer environments. This should support the stock’s upward trajectory and push it to new highs over time. Disclosure Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: Costco's Combo Of Strong Loyalty, Unmatched Value Is Rare In Retail: Analyst

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. On Thursday, JP Morgan analyst Christopher Horvers raised the price target on Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) to $1,090 (from $945 prior) while maintaining an Overweight rating following November sales results. The company reported net sales of $21.87 billion for the retail month of November (four weeks ending December 1, 2024), reflecting a 5.6% increase from $20.71 billion last year. For the twelve-week first quarter ending November 24, 2024, net sales reached $60.99 billion, up 7.5% from $56.72 billion last year. Net sales for the first thirteen weeks totaled $66.52 billion, an increase of 7.2% compared to $62.04 billion in the prior year. E-commerce sales in November were down by an estimated 15 percentage points due to the later timing of Thanksgiving, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday this year compared to last year. This shift resulted in a roughly 1.5% decrease in total and comparable sales. The analyst writes that they continue to believe that COST remains a core holding due to its unmatched value proposition, characterized by 11% gross margins, a loyal customer base with a ~90% renewal rate, and a global growth opportunity of 2%-3% annually. The analyst adds that this combination is rare in retail and consumer staples, with the potential to double its current store base. The latter is its GICS classification. The analyst adds that Costco continues to outperform most of retail in terms of share gains and traffic trends, particularly due to its 70% consumable assortment. For December, the analyst expects core U.S. comps to be +6.7%, Canada to +8.2%, and Other International to +9.0%, resulting in a total company core comp of +7.2%. Investors can gain exposure to the stock via Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF (NYSE:VDC) and Fidelity MSCI Consumer Staples Index ETF (NYSE:FSTA). Price Action: COST shares are down 0.49% at $986.06 at the last check Thursday.

When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. If you’re looking for a deal on anything Apple sells—an iPad, Apple Watch, AirPods, MacBook, iPhone, or anything else—there’s no better time to get one than Cyber Monday. No matter what you’re looking to buy, you’re going to find a great price—and some are at the lowest we’ve ever seen. If you want to know what Apple is doing for Cyber Monday, it’s offering gift cards up to $200/£160 with select purchases. We have the details of that deal and what’s included in our Apple’s 2024 Black Friday Shopping Event article. Cyber Monday is a great time to get an Apple product for less, but the discounts come and go very quickly. Stay tuned to this page up to and throughout the Black Friday weekend as we update you with the best prices on new Apple products as they arrive. Many of the best deals we see are on Amazon U.S. or Amazon U.K., but we’ll also be checking resellers such as Best Buy, B&H and Walmart in the U.S. and KRCS, AO, Argos, John Lewis, Currys, Laptops Direct and eBuyer in the U.K. Apple released new MacBook Pros with M4 chips in late October 2024. At the same time, it upgraded the RAM in all MacBook Air models from 8GB to 16GB for the same starting prices, effectively a $200/£200 discount. So if you’re shopping make sure the model you’re buying has 16GB of RAM. We don’t recommend buying a model with 8GB of RAM unless it’s much more than $200/£200 cheaper than the 16GB model. U.S. Foundry Additionally, Apple’s older MacBook Pro models are on clearance as retailers look to clear out remaining stock: U.K. Apple’s older MacBook models are on clearance at the following retailers: The iMac and Mac mini both received new M4 chips in October, with the Mac mini also getting a dramatic redesign that shrunk the case down to just 5 inches. Like the MacBooks, these new Macs now start at 16GB of RAM, an option that was previously an extra $200/£200. So be sure to double-check that you’re buying the updated model with an M4 processor. Older iMacs only offer 8GB of RAM, so the price should match that. Save money off a new iMac. Foundry U.S. There are savings on the older models as well: For more monitors for your Mac look at Best Mac monitor deals for Black Friday U.K. In the U.K. when Apple announced the iMac and Mac mini in 2024 it dropped prices compared to the previous generation, so keep this in mind if considering a discount on an M3 model. These older models are also discounted: The AirPods 4 with and without ANC are Apple’s newest earbuds that replaced the AirPods generation 2 and 3 in September. Apple also updated the AirPods Max with a USB-C port in September, but otherwise, it’s the same as the Lightning model. And while the AirPods Pro 2 are a couple of years old, Apple added a new feature in iOS 18,1 that lets it work as a hearing aid. We usually see some tremendous savings on the standard AirPods over Black Friday, but this year beware: you may see a blowout deal on the older models, but unless you’re on a very tight budget, our advice is that even if you see a good deal on the AirPods 3 you should spring for one of the AirPods 4 models on sale even if they cost more. The AirPods 4 without ANC cost $129/£129 and compare very favorably with the AirPods 3 which used to cost $179/£179. AirPods 4 are Apple’s newest earbuds and are already on sale. Petter Ahrnstedt U.S. U.K. There are also savings on older models, but as we mentioned above, we recommend skipping any AirPods 3rd gen deals because the AirPods 4 are much better. Mike Sawh Apple launched the Apple Watch Series 10 with a slightly larger screen in September 2024 as well as a new black color for the Apple Watch Ultra. Traditionally, any savings around $50 is an excellent deal. Look out for the Apple Watch Series 9 as there may be some deals on the discontinued model. U.S. U.K. Apple updated all of its iPads in 2024 with the exception of the 10th-gen entry-level model (though it did get a price cut to $349). The iPad mini was the most recent model to get a refresh, with a new chip and 8GB of RAM. We are seeing some good deals on new iPads. Foundry U.S. If you’re buying a new Apple Pencil the Apple Pencil Pro is the newest model and compatible with the iPad Pro, iPad Air, and iPad mini. The USB-C Apple Pencil is also compatible with these models as well as the 10th-gen iPad, but doesn’t have squeeze gestures or magnetic charging. If you see a deal on any Apple Pencils make sure they work with your iPad first. U.K. U.S. Most iPhone deals in the U.S. are through carriers and require a trade-in or adding a new line. You can read our best Black Friday iPhone deals roundup for more information. However, there are some discounts on previous models: U.K. David Price / Foundry There are Cyber Monday deals on many of the streamers, for example, Hulu is bundling Disney+ for a saving of 85 percent (just $2.99 a month). Peacock has 75 percent off at $1.99 a month for six months. Paramount is offering a couple of months at $2.99. Britbox is offering subscriptions for $8 a month, 50 percent off the usual price. Sadly Apple isn’t discounting Apple TV+, however, as we explain in How to get Apple TV+ for free you can get much more than Apple’s 7-day trial or even Apple’s 3 months for free if you buy an Apple product. In fact, there are even some Cyber Monday deals: As for Apple’s set-top box, there are small savings to be had, but this is a case where it would be better to buy from Apple and get the $25 voucher with it. See our round-up of the Best Apple TV deals. U.S. U.K. In October, Apple updated its Mac accessories with USB-C ports but didn’t bring any other changes. Thiago Trevisan/Foundry U.S. U.K. Every year Apple holds a shopping event from Black Friday (November 29) to Cyber Monday (December 2).
