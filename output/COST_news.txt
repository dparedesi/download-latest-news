Δ Sitting at the intersection of geopolitical headwinds, U.S. tariffs, AI disruption and an increasingly cost-conscious consumer, the question hanging over the retail industry is this: Can anyone thrive when the shopper won’t save them? While extended sales events like Amazon’s Prime Day and Walmart+ Week were once celebratory bonanzas of consumption, this year they felt more like high-stakes stress tests of brand agility, pricing power and technological readiness. Amazon’s extended four-day Prime Day drove billions in sales, but beneath the surface, it exposed a consumer increasingly focused on sub-$20 essentials and less interested in big-ticket impulse buys. The average household spend — $156 — was roughly flat year over year, even as inflation cooled. Walmart, responding in kind, leaned heavily on its Walmart+ Week campaign to underscore “everyday low prices,” particularly on school supplies, which it advertised as costing less than last year. Meanwhile, Target and Sam’s Club froze prices on seasonal items to maintain loyalty amid looming tariff threats on imports from China. But the move may signal desperation as much as differentiation: Target’s sales and stock are both in decline, and CEO Brian Cornell’s exit has thrown future strategy into question.

The Impact of Tariffs on Consumer Product Prices and Availability At the center of the ongoing retail transformation is a consumer cohort that is more cautious, more tech-savvy and more values-driven than ever before. Demographically, Gen Z and younger millennials are driving new expectations. They want personalized experiences, instant fulfillment and ethical transparency. They’re also more likely to toggle between online and offline seamlessly — expecting their digital cart to follow them from app to aisle. Financially, the mood is somber. Student loan repayments have resumed. Mortgage rates remain elevated. Tariffs are crunching margins. And while inflation is technically slowing, the feel of financial strain lingers. PYMNTS Intelligence research found that more than 8 in 10 consumers are taking measures to offset the financial impact of tariffs on their bank accounts. “In fact, the average individual is making nearly five such behavioral changes, and 44% of consumers have already changed their shopping habits in response to tariff-induced price pressures,” PYMNTS wrote. This cocktail of economic anxiety and digital fluency has created a demanding, paradoxical shopper: loyal to value but fickle with brands; frugal with spending but potentially generous with praise for standout experiences.

Amazon is doubling down on scale and vertical control. Not only did it leverage Prime Day to reinforce its consumer grip, but it’s also pushing ahead on two transformative fronts: cloud artificial intelligence (AI) and autonomous retail infrastructure. Its AWS division is reportedly launching a marketplace for AI agents, further embedding generative intelligence into business services. Behind the scenes, Amazon is expanding fulfillment centers, deploying predictive AI to optimize inventory, and eyeing another multibillion-dollar stake in Anthropic, one of the most advanced AI labs in the world. Walmart, by contrast, is embedding smarter tools at the associate level. The company is cutting hundreds of store support roles, but reallocating resources to train frontline employees with AI-enhanced operational tools — including real-time inventory checks, task automation and natural language assistance. While Amazon is centralizing its AI ecosystem, Walmart is distributing intelligence at the edge. While Amazon and Walmart throw billions at transformation, mid-market retailers are being crushed by indecision. Lacking the scale to out-price Walmart or the tech stack to compete with Amazon, brands like Kohl’s, Macy’s and regional grocers are increasingly vulnerable. Some are trying to unify digital and in-store experiences, as seen in Mexico where retailers are under pressure to blend mobile and physical journeys to meet rising consumer expectations. But building omnichannel infrastructure is capital-intensive — and in this environment, capital is tight. Even Costco, long immune to cyclical spending dips, is leaning more heavily on non-food categories and fresh food to drive a modest 5.8% sales bump. It’s a strong number in a tough climate, but it also signals that volume, not margin, is doing the heavy lifting.
