Manage your account Thousands of drivers across the country are discovering their car paint jobs are literally peeling away — and fixing it could cost them thousands out of pocket. For Ed Rinkowitz, a Florida Hyundai owner, the flaky paint job is a familiar and frustrating sight. I'm 49 years old and have nothing saved for retirement — what should I do? Don't panic. Here are 6 of the easiest ways you can catch up (and fast) Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how Want an extra $1,300,000 when you retire? Dave Ramsey says this 7-step plan ‘works every single time’ to kill debt, get rich in America — and that ‘anyone’ can do it “My daughter's hood basically just flaked completely off, probably maybe 10% of the paint was left on it,” Rinkowitz told 10 Tampa Bay. “Then my wife’s car started and that was probably 30 to 40% that was coming off.” Rinkowitz says it’s the third Hyundai in his family with paint issues — and he’s far from alone. A Facebook group called “Hyundai Paint Peel / Peeling” has grown to over 6,000 members, all sharing stories of paint jobs seemingly disintegrating. So what’s causing the problem, and what can drivers do to protect their cars and wallets? While the issue spans several Hyundai models and paint colors, Rinkowitz says two of his affected vehicles were white — a trend echoed by dozens of other drivers. News station 10 Investigates also spoke with owners of Kia, Toyota and Chevrolet vehicles reporting similar issues. Rinkowitz brought his concerns to the dealership, but hit a wall. “I’ve got two white 2015 Elantras, very similar models, and they said, ‘Well, it’s not under warranty,’” he told 10 Investigates. Instead, he was told to go to a body shop — a fix he didn’t feel should fall on him. And it isn’t cheap. According to Bankrate, repainting a car can cost anywhere from $300 to more than $20,000, depending on the vehicle size, paint type and finish. A typical paint job costs around $3,000. A class-action lawsuit has been filed on behalf of Hyundai customers who say their paint peeled off prematurely. In response, some automakers have extended warranties and issued recalls. Hyundai announced a paint warranty extension for eight models, including 2017 and 2018 Elantras, Sonatas and Santa Fes. The coverage applies to peeling or bubbling white paint, especially around the hood, fenders and roof. Other drivers haven’t been as lucky. One Toyota Corolla owner told 10 Investigates that her dealership said the paint recall expired last year — even though her paint is now peeling off her car with just a spray from a garden hose.

In fact, you can get started with as little as $10 — here’s how Whether the issue is a manufacturer defect or not, there are steps car owners can take to help prevent paint damage before it gets worse. Parking in a garage or shaded area helps. Prolonged exposure to sunlight, bird droppings, tree sap and hail can speed up peeling and cracking. UV rays, in particular, cause paint to fade and break down over time. If your car’s paint starts to peel, don’t assume you're out of options. Attorney Charles Gallagher says a denied warranty claim isn’t necessarily the end of the road. He recommends asking the manufacturer for a warranty extension, especially if the issue stems from a known defect in the paint or its application. Automakers have their own processes for addressing paint complaints. Hyundai advises drivers to check their vehicle identification number (VIN) on the company’s website to see if they qualify for a paint warranty extension. Kia recommends starting with your local dealership, but if that doesn’t work, the company encourages contacting its customer care team directly. For now, many drivers are still trying to figure out what to do. “I’m 70 years old. I’ve owned cars since I was like 16 years old,” Rinkowitz said. “I’ve never had a car where the paint flaked off like that.” This tiny hot Costco item has skyrocketed 74% in price in under 2 years — but now the retail giant is restricting purchases.

Title: An elegant and hefty cheeseburger bento awaits at the “Japanese Costco” Lopia

Bringing you yesterday's news from Japan and Asia, today. RocketNews24 Japanese It’s so classy, you’ll want to eat it with a knife and fork. There’s a supermarket in Japan nicknamed the “Japanese Costco” because much like its namesake, it sells very large quantities of food at bulk-discount prices. Its real name is Lopia, and our writer Ikuna Kamezawa often enjoys going there even though many of the things for sale are way too big for her to ever eat on her own. But this time, a certain cheeseburger bento caught her eye. It was large, but not too large, and only cost 1,078 yen (US$7.40), so she decided to take the meaty plunge. It was so big that she could barely fit it into her shopping bag and things only got worse as it started to rain while she walked home. She had to carry it very carefully too, for reasons we’ll see in a moment. After getting home, she unveiled her Manpuku Burger Double Cheese and confirmed its size at about 25 centimeters (10 inches) in length. Popping the lid off we can see that the very fancy arrangement was why Ikuna had to carry it so carefully, and the sheer volume of it all was the reason it was priced a little more than a Big Mac combo. She felt kind of bad disturbing the elegant layout of her bento, but she had to take stock of what was inside before eating it. There was a double cheeseburger with two patties and two slices of cheese, some seasoned fries, and two breaded chicken filets. That photo might not do the size justice so she took some shots alongside a pack of matches for scale. Sure, a matchbox might not be the most universally understood comparison, but she was just so excited to eat this thing. ▼ Fries ▼ Chicken Filets ▼ Double Cheese Burger Ikuna turned her attention back to the cheeseburger and tried to reassemble it in a normal way. That’s when she noticed something was off with the proportions of the bun and patties. She thought this must be some chic designer cheeseburger arrangement she’d never seen before. That might give the illusion Lopia is being chintzy with the meat, but rest assured they were good-sized beef patties. For a more understandable comparison, Ikuna placed a Yamazaki Bakery convenience store cheeseburger next to it. This store-bought burger selling for about 99 yen is slightly smaller than a McDonald’s cheeseburger and the Lopia burger blows it out of the water. ▼ Lopia’s burger ▼ Yamazaki’s burger There were definitely some structural integrity issues with it though, so our writer opted to eat the whole thing with a knife and fork. A fancy burger like this deserves fancy eating utensils anyway. The hamburger patty wasn’t juicy at all, but it was very dense and meaty. This texture might turn some burger aficionados off, but she felt kids would really go for it. There was also a sweet ketchup on it, but really the flavor of the beef stood out so much that she barely even remembers eating the cheese and bun. While it might not be for everyone, the taste of this burger bento was right up Ikuna’s alley. Her only complaint — if you could call it that — was that it was too much for her to eat in one sitting. But for the price she paid, that’s the kind of problem you’d want to have. In conclusion, she definitely recommends the Manpuku Burger Double Cheese for big eaters. Lopia can be a little random with their offerings, especially in the bento section, but Fridays are known as “Fry Days” there which is when they usually go all out in that department so your best chance is to find it then.
