The latest Pokemon TCG release once again results in empty shelves at release. By Amanda Kay Oaks It feels like only yesterday that people were brawling in Costco over Scarlet and Violet – Prismatic Evolutions Pokemon cards. Yet another popular Pokemon TCG set has arrived, and it’s seeing similar shortage issues to the Eeveelution set. The Pokemon 151: Blooming Waters Premium Collection launched on February 7th alongside the Prismatic Evolutions mini-tins. Both of these are new collections of cards that have already been printed, but clearly, demand for Pokemon 151 and Prismatic Evolutions remains high. This led Pokemon fans and resellers to once again line up at their local Gamestop, with disappointing results. Though no all-out fist fights have made the rounds with this latest release, many fans are sharing the long lines at retailers, particularly GameStop. Once again, there don’t seem to be nearly enough cards to go around as fans attempt to get ahold of even just one Blooming Waters set. In fact, many GameStop locations have reportedly been posting paper signs on their store windows with updates on their stock. And that stock seems suspiciously low, even by Pokemon TCG standards. While some lucky fans have managed to get their hands on the Blooming Waters Premiun Set, plenty of collectors are once again leaving empty handed. Many GameStop locations appeared to have anywhere from just a few to zero of the new Mini Tins, Surprise Boxes, and Blooming Waters sets. This led some fans to wonder if employees weren’t taking advantage of the early access to stock, as many question how stores have so few of the new sets even after the Pokemon Company promised to do better after Prismatic Evolutions. Shortly after the Costco debacle with the last Prismatic Evolutions release, GameStop posted a sassy message on social media. The repost of the viral video included a suggestion that, due to GameStop’s Blooming Waters limit of 2 per customer, their stores were above such issues. We support battling Pokémon, not battling over Pokémon.Blooming Waters arrives at GameStop on February 7th with a 2 per customer limit.Do better, @Costco. https://t.co/CgMXd8MY0E Many fans are thinking back on this post now, as stores seem unable to provide even those two measly boxes for most customers. As one post compiling signs from various GameStop locations reveals, many shops claimed to have only 1 or 2 total boxes of the new Pokemon TCG cards before they even opened. This has led many fans to speculate that employees must be buying up the stock before it hits shelves. Whether or not that’s true, many stores accepted preorders for Blooming Waters and the new additions to the Prismatic Evolutions line. So, it is certainly possible that the shortages are due to the fact that preorders accounted for most of the stock these locations received. Regardless of the cause, collectors are frustrated to once again line up early only to find no Pokemon TCG cards available. Others note the upcharge on stock that is available. The Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) for the Blooming Waters Premium Collection. is $59.99. According to customer reports and the current website pricing, GameStop is selling the sets for $10 above that, at $69.99. This isn’t nearly the upcharge we can expect from resellers who nabbed the cards today, but has some customers feeling extra frustrated as the stock shortages and excess cost combine. Unlike with Prismatic Evolutions, The Pokemon Company has not yet issued a statement about the shortage issues for Blooming Waters specifically. They have, however, implemented changes to the Pokemon Center website in an effort to tackle bots and scalpers buying up cards online. Despite this, many fans report being unable to get ahold of the cards on release day. Clearly, the difference in supply and demand will continue to be an issue for Pokemon TCG fans for the foreseeable future. Were you able to get the Prismatic Evolutions or Blooming Waters sets?

Title: ‘I Feel Like a Drug Dealer’: How Beth’s Cafe Sources Eggs for Its 12-Egg Omelets

Filed under: The egg shortage has hit the legendary Green Lake diner, where the massive omelets cost as much as $42, particularly hard Beth’s Cafe, on the side of Aurora as you drive through Green Lake, is a battered, venerable diner that for decades has been the place in north Seattle to go when you need to eat after midnight. It’s small, it’s unpretentious, it’s family-friendly, and it has a problem: eggs. As nearly everyone knows by now, an outbreak of bird flu has killed so many chickens that the supply chain has been badly disrupted. Prices have gone up, stores are struggling to keep eggs in stock, and restaurants nationwide are scrambling (pun intended) to navigate the new environment. Some places have changed their menus to de-emphasize eggs while others are charging more — Waffle House now has a 50-cent per-egg surcharge. Among Seattle restaurants, Beth’s is particularly affected by this shortage. It’s famous for its massive, 12-egg omelets, and even its six-egg omelets and three-egg scrambles are heavy on the eggs. The diner goes through 15 to 20 cases of eggs a week, co-owner Mason Reed (who took over Beth’s last year) tells Eater Seattle. A case is 15 dozen eggs, so that means the restaurant cracks open upwards of 3,600 eggs a week, which averages to more than 500 per day. Since the onset of the bird flu, Reed has been stressed about getting enough eggs to meet that demand. Beth’s had been sourcing its eggs from Wilcox Farms, but “lately we’ve had to branch out,” the owner says. Reed and his team have been going to Costco and US Food’s Chef’Store and making calls to anywhere that might have eggs. The prices can vary wildly, and some distributors have limits on how many eggs they can sell. “It’s been a juggling act,” Reed says. “I feel like a drug dealer trying to find my source,” Reed adds. “I’m calling around, going, ‘What’s the price? How many can you offer?’” It’s not just the bird flu causing prices to rise. At the beginning of 2024, a new Washington law required all eggs sold in the state to be cage-free. The price per egg Beth’s was paying jumped from 9 cents to about 27 cents; a case was around $40, Reed says. In the past few months prices have jumped again and now Reed is paying anywhere from $80 to $150 per case, depending on the week. “It just is really turbulent,” says Reed. Menu prices reflect these changes. In 2020, the Triple Bypass version of the 12-egg omelet (with bacon, sausage, ham, and two kinds of cheese) was $22.50, according to the Seattle Times. In 2023, when Beth’s reopened after a temporary closure, the price had ticked up to $34.95. Now that same omelet is $41.95. Reed says he’s raised prices twice since the start of 2024, once to deal with the cost of the cage-free law and once to offset the cost of Seattle’s rising minimum wage. “Beth’s is famous for their big omelets, it’s not something I want to get rid of,” Reed says. But he is contemplating menu changes. Reed says the restaurant may try to have more non-egg options, including tofu scrambles, and offer smaller portions for under $15. “We’re trying our best to keep prices as low as possible,” he says. Beth’s may offer $42 omelets for the wannabe competitive eaters out there, but at its core it’s a diner that’s supposed to serve affordable, filling food to families and working people. At least Reed has found a stable source of eggs, for now. “They’re a lot more than they were, but [the price] is not going up,” he says. His new supplier is a California-based company called Alderwood Eggs, but he hesitates to throw that name around. “I don’t want to put it out there because I don’t want everyone to buy all my eggs.” Sign up for our newsletter.
