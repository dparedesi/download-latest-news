Target posted its biggest earnings miss in two years and cut its forecast. The company spoke about a "deceleration in discretionary demand" and blamed higher costs caused by the rush to move inventory ahead of the short-lived port strike in October. On the company's earnings call, CEO Brian Cornell described U.S. consumers who are "shopping carefully as they work to overcome the cumulative impact of multiple years of price inflation" and holding out for the best possible deal. Walmart, on the other hand, hiked its full-year forecast. It said it's gaining upper-income shoppers and seeing better trends for sales of merchandise outside of the grocery department, even as consumers look for value. Customer traffic gains were similar at the two stores, yet Walmart's sales trends looked much better than Target's. Walmart's traffic growth edged out its rival's, with a gain of 3.1% at Walmart U.S. versus 2.4% at Target. Walmart's same-store sales rose 5.3%, while Target's increased only 0.3% year over year. Walmart's e-commerce sales in the U.S. rose 22%, a bigger increase than the nearly 11% at Target. The sharp differences between the two big-box retailers — and how their businesses are executing in the same economic backdrop — illustrate where consumers are willing to spend money and where they are pulling back as they remain selective about spending. That sharp divergence of the winners and losers in the industry could become even starker as retailers enter their most crucial sales season of the year. Michael Baker, a retail analyst at D.A. Davidson, said Target's disappointing results reflect the company's performance rather than the health of consumers. "It's as simple as this: They are losing share," Baker said. "They are losing share to Walmart, Amazon and Costco." He said Target's inconsistent results over the past year are a warning sign about execution. The company has missed Wall Street's quarterly sales and earnings expectations in two quarters and beat on them in two other quarters. "That kind of back and forth makes you wonder if there's something going on internally," he said. Several equity research analysts, including Citi Research, Deutsche Bank and HSBC Global Research, downgraded Target's stock Wednesday, citing concerns that the Minneapolis-based retailer has lost shoppers and sales to competitors. Its stock dropped more than 20% in trading Wednesday. In a research note, Paul Lejuez, a retail analyst for Citi, said the company's poor results and weak outlook show Target is "likely losing share" to Walmart and risks losing more of the market unless it steps up promotions. One of the roots of Target's troubles is the company's merchandise mix, said Kate McShane, a retail analyst for Goldman Sachs. About 60% of Target's sales come from discretionary items, such as home goods and clothing. That's the opposite of Walmart, which draws about 60% of its sales from everyday necessities, such as groceries and household items such as paper towels. Those discretionary categories, which customers sometimes splurge or pull back on, explain "some of the volatility and the bumpiness you are seeing that is more specific to Target," she said. Both Walmart and Target mentioned the negative impact of the port strike, but Target appeared to put a major share of the blame for its weak quarter on the stoppage. D.A. Davidson's Baker said weak sales can "make those kinds of cost increases stand out more." Target has other questions that will factor into its future, including who will lead the company. Cornell, who has been chief executive since 2014, agreed in September 2022 to stay on as the company's leader for three more years. On a call with investors Wednesday, Cornell pointed to "green shoots" in the business, even as sales results disappointed. He spoke about customer traffic growth, online sales gains and relative strength in apparel sales, even as unseasonably warm weather kept shoppers from buying clothes for cooler temperatures. Yet on that same call, several analysts posed questions about Target's plans for the future. UBS equity research analyst Michael Lasser asked if Target needs to make changes or invest more in its business. Cornell said the company will stick with what it already does: offering unique items and national brands, opening new stores, expanding its advertising business and offering more ways for shoppers to buy online. "We'll continue on our current strategy, stay in step with the consumer and make sure Target's doing the things that consumers across America expect from us," he said. Got a confidential news tip?

Title: Weekly Climate and Energy News Roundup #620

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change Quote of the Week: “Whoever undertakes to set himself up as a judge in the field of Truth and Knowledge is shipwrecked by the laughter of the gods.” – Albert Einstein (1953) Number of the Week: 2,000 years ago THIS WEEK: By Ken Haapala, President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP) Scope: This Week begins with a discussion by Roy Spencer on adjustments that may be needed on the record high temperature recorded in Death Valley California. Kenneth Richard suggests five papers that indicate that increasing CO2 may have an insignificant influence on global temperatures. Roger Caiazza discusses problems New York State may have in meeting its energy goals, particularly replacing fossil fuels and nuclear with alternatives. Matt Ridley points out that the recent flooding of Valencia may be the result of eliminating flood control dams. Comments on the beginning of COP-29 are presented. An article by an academic illustrates what is too frequently missed in academic analyses of energy policy. ********************* A Fallen Icon? Roy Spencer continued his essays exploring the widely accepted high temperature for the United States of 134° F (57° C) recorded at Greenland Ranch in Death Valley California (now called Furnace Creek Ranch) on July 10, 1913. John Christy prompted Spencer to look into this record. Recently, after extensive historical research, William Reidd doubted the record and suggested the new observer in 1913 was disillusioned by the low readings taken at the official weather station. He may have substituted readings from his front porch of official readings. Reid provided a photograph showing that the official station was located by an irrigated alfalfa field, which was not a typical the desert location. In the summer, irrigation in the desert lowers daytime high temperatures and raises nighttime low temperatures. So, the siting of the weather station was poor, and it probably produced high temperature readings that were too low for the area, but that is not known. Spencer states: “In my experience, unless the vegetation area is rather large, and there is almost no wind, a weather station’s daily maximum temperature will still be largely determined by air flowing from the larger-scale desert surroundings. But note… this is different from, say a poorly sited thermometer next to a brick wall or heat pump where hot air from an isolated source can elevate the daily maximum temperature recorded).” Spencer analyzes maximum temperatures for the 27 surrounding stations up to 100 miles away from Death Valley and at different elevations for the period 1935 to 1938. Then he examines the maximum temperatures for the 3 to 7 stations during 1912 to 1915 and finds significant disparity from the Death Valley records. Spencer then provides a statistical analysis based on lapse rate to adjust for the different elevations in this dry climate. He concludes: “The 134 deg. F world record hottest temperature from Death Valley is likely around 10 deg. F too high, compared to elevation-adjusted temperatures from surrounding stations. The most likely cause is that the ranch foreman’s reported measurements were (shall we say) unacademically recorded. I find it rather remarkable that the world record hottest temperature from Death Valley was not revised many years ago, since the methods for “fact checking” the record are fairly simple and based upon meteorological principles known for well over 50 years.” So, we do not know what the highest temperature recorded in the US is. It may be around 10° F, 6° C too high. Until NOAA began manipulating the US surface temperature records in the early part of the 21st century with no clear justification and no record of changes, the US record was the best in the world covering a large area. One wonders how many of the surface records used by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and its collaborators can stand up to the rigorous examination Roy Spencer did on the Greenland Ranch record. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy. *************** Miniscule Effect of CO2: Kenneth Richard discusses six papers: one that asserts that CO2 is the control knob of Earth’s temperatures and five that refute that assertion. In addressing the claim that CO2’s climate effects are undetectable Richard states: “Of course, this very unfalsifiable thought experiment is what believers in the CO2-is-the-climate-control-knob narrative rest their case on. But even if we do use this imaginary-world premise, the existing models (MODTRAN, HITRAN) that allegedly support the CO2-controls-climate orthodoxy actually undermine it.” Richard then discusses five papers that contradict the CO2 controls-climate notion. He does not discuss the contradictions TWTW prefers. The papers from van Wijngaarden and Happer use the high resolution HITRAN spectroscopy as discussed in last week’s TWTW, under Updating HITRAN. In their papers van Wijngaarden and Happer have convincingly demonstrated that adding CO2 to the atmosphere has a miniscule effect on temperatures. For example, see Figure 7 in their “The Role of Greenhouse Gases in Energy Transfer in the Earth’s Atmosphere.” These estimates are well tested using satellite data over Guam (tropics), the Sahara (desert); Mediterranean (mid-latitudes) and the Antarctic (polar regions). Based on these calculations, the overall impact of CO2 at current concentrations is less than 25% of the greenhouse effect, and doubling CO2 concentration would add a mere 2%. Water vapor accounts for almost all of the effect. The one issue that is still not clear is clouds. The calculations by van Wijngaarden and Happer are for clear skies. Clouds are extremely complicated, and no one has developed an adequate theory for their formation and dissipation. However, their overall influence will reduce the warming of Earth from the greenhouse effect. This was seen during the Little Ice Age in Europe, when skies were overcast, growing seasons were short, and crops frequently did not ripen properly in the northern parts of Europe. Diseases attributed to mycotoxins formed by moldy grain were common. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy – Radiation Transfer. *************** Dreams Hit Reality: New York State has adopted an imaginative energy policy the “Dispatchable Emissions-Free Resource” – DEFR. Dispatchable means that the power source can be adjusted to match the electricity demand. Nuclear, coal, and similar power plants require time to adjust. Gas and Combined Cycle Gas Generation can be adjusted in less time. Gas turbines require little time. Wind and solar cannot be adjusted to increase output unless they are operating under capacity for current weather conditions. Large hydropower can be adjusted quickly. New York State, which has no additional hydropower practically possible, has closed all but three nuclear power plants. No one has identified a Dispatchable Emissions-Free Resource to fill increasing state needs. Given these conditions, Roger Caiazza who analyzes electricity needs for New York State discusses “Renewable Transition Raw Materials Challenge” based on the Bulletin 416 of the Bulletins of the Geological Survey of Finland, which “publishes the results of scientific research that is thematically or geographically connected to Finnish or Fennoscandian geology.” The Abstract of a paper referenced in the bulletin is “Scope of the replacement system to globally phase out fossil fuels” which states: “The task to phase out fossil fuels is now at hand. Most studies and publications to date focus on why fossil fuels should be phased out. This study presents the physical requirements in terms of required non-fossil fuel industrial capacity, to completely phase out fossil fuels, and maintain the existing industrial ecosystem. The existing industrial ecosystem dependency on fossil fuels was mapped by fuel (oil, gas, and coal) and by industrial application. Data were collected globally for fossil fuel consumption, physical activity, and industrial actions for the year 2018. The estimated sum total of extra annual capacity of non-fossil fuel power generation to phase out fossil fuels completely, and maintain the existing industrial ecosystem, at a global scale is 48,939.8 TWh. A discussion on the needed size of the stationary power storage buffer to manage intermittent energy supply from wind and solar was conducted. Pumped hydro, hydrogen, biofuels, and ammonia were all examined as options in this paper. This study uses four stationary power buffer capacities: 6 hours, 48 hours + 10%, 28 days and 12 weeks. This power buffer is assumed to be supplied through the use of large battery banks (in line with strategic policy expectations). An estimate is presented for the total quantity of metals required to manufacture a single generation of renewable technology units (EV’s, solar panels, wind turbines, etc.) sufficient to replace energy technologies based on combustion of fossil fuels. This estimate was derived by assembling the number of units needed against the estimated metal content for individual battery chemistries, wind turbines, solar panels, and electric vehicles. The majority of the metals needed were to resource the construction of stationary power storage to act as a buffer for wind and solar power generation. It was shown that both 2019 global mine production, 2022 global reserve estimates, 2022 mineral resources, and estimates of undersea resources, were manifestly inadequate for meeting projected demand for copper, lithium, nickel, cobalt, graphite, and vanadium.” Another second article referenced in the Bulletin is “Quantity of metals required to manufacture one generation of renewable technology units to phase out fossil fuel.” The abstract of that paper states: “An estimate is presented for the total quantity of raw materials required to manufacture a single generation of renewable technology units (solar panels, wind turbines, etc.) sufficient to replace energy technologies based on combustion of fossil fuels. This estimate was derived by assembling the number of units needed against the estimated metal con- tent for individual battery chemistries, wind turbines, solar panels, and electric vehicles. The majority of the metals needed were to resource the construction of stationary power storage to act as a buffer for wind and solar power generation. This study uses four stationary power buffer capacities as modelled in a previous study: 6 hours, 48 hours + 10%, 28 days and 12 weeks. This power buffer is assumed to be supplied through the use of large battery banks (in line with strategic policy expectations). Metal quantities were calculated for all four capacities and compared with mining production, mineral reserves, mineral resources, and known undersea resources. It was also assessed whether recycling could deliver this metal quantity by comparing calculations against the sum total mined metal between 1990 and 2023. The quantity of metal mined over the last 34 years was inadequate, which means recycling cannot deliver the needed capacity, and the mining of minerals would have to be the primary source of metals for at least the first generation of non-fossil fuel technology. If a metal has not yet been mined, then that metal cannot be recycled.” [Boldface added] Caiazza provides a solid analysis of this bulletin and concludes: “This is an ambitious analysis that covers the entire global energy system. As such there are bound to be oversights and limitations as well as interpretative assumptions that could be issues. In my opinion, however, the approach and assumptions are reasonable and should give a reasonable estimate of the metals needed. The mass of metals available is another challenge but I think there is better historical data available. Comparing the metals needed to the metals available leads to the inescapable conclusion that the dreams of replacing fossil fuels will be unable to overcome reality.” [Boldface added] New York State’s Dispatchable Emissions-Free Resource remains a pipedream without nuclear or hydropower additions. Both omissions will greatly increase the costs of electricity to consumers in the state. Yet, politicians continue to pretend reliable electricity is not needed. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy. *************** Destroying Resilience: The recent flooding of Valencia, Spain, has been declared an example of an extreme weather event intensified by climate change (whatever that is). Writing in The Spectator (UK), Matt Ridely provides a different view. He writes: In the past few years, the Spanish government has been removing dams at a furious rate. Under a European Union program to encourage the restoration of rivers to their wild state for the benefit of fish migration, Spain set about dismantling barriers of all kinds. In 2021 it got rid of 108 dams and weirs; in 2022, another 133. That year, according to Dam Removal Europe, a coalition of seven green pressure groups, it was Europe’s proud league champion at dismantling them. Last year it was second only to France. [Boldface added] Some dams were removed in the hills around Valencia but it turns out they were small irrigation dams, not reservoir dams, so they would not have made much difference last week. However, the failure to build a new dam may well be partly to blame. The Cheste dam in the Turia catchment was specifically designed to prevent flooding, to ‘regulate the flows coming from the upper basin of the Poyo and Pozalet ravines. It was approved in 2001 as part of a National Hydrological Plan. Objections from people in Aragon to separate parts of the plan that would transfer water between regions led the socialist Jose Luis Rodríguez Zapatero to promise to repeal it when running for prime minister in 2004. He kept his promise and the Cheste dam was an unintended casualty. Could it have saved Valencia? Possibly. The [capital] city of Aragon was saved last month by a dam built by the emperor Augustus.” These extreme weather events have been going on since the time of Emperor Augustus and are not the result of recent “climate change.” Instead, the high death toll is the result of destruction of the resilience provided by dams designed to prevent flooding. A similar failure to build dams recommended by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) near Ashville, NC, probably resulted in the recent flooding there. See links under Changing Weather. *************** A Circus? The 29th Conference of Parties (COP 29) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) has begun in Baku, Azerbaijan, an oil and gas producing country According to reports, in his welcoming speech to the delegates and other attendees, the President of the host country declared oil and gas are gifts of God. The President of COP 29, Azerbaijan’s Mister for Ecology, demanded that climate change be treated with the same urgency as COVID-19 for which “advanced economies marshalled $8 trillion over the course of just 48 months.” Not to be outdone, Jo Nova reports that the world’s largest emitter of carbon dioxide, by far, China, wants $1.3 trillion from wealthy nations. This “backward” nation has planned 100 space launches for 2024 in its goal to put someone on the Moon by 2030. Meanwhile White House climate adviser John Podesta who is at the conference assured the attendees that the US will move forward in “combating climate change despite the election of President-elect Trump, who has long cast doubt on the science behind the issue.” In December 2023, the US State Department issued a report on the US Climate Finance Pledge which stated: “The United States is committed to exercising U.S. leadership to implement the goals of the Paris Agreement, to accelerate the global clean energy transition, and to enable vulnerable countries and communities to build resilience against the impacts of climate change. To that end, the United States will continue to support developing country partners as they pursue ambitious climate action. The United States has prioritized boosting international climate finance, as well as demanding that international financial institutions evolve to better enable emerging market and developing countries to respond to global challenges, including climate change. That is why President Biden launched the first U.S. International Climate Finance Plan in 2021 and committed to work with Congress to scale up international public climate finance to over $11 billion annually by 2024, quadrupling from the highest previous levels of climate finance provided by the United States.” Apparently, some attendees believe that believe oil and gas are “gifts of God” ignoring them is very costly. Will wealthy countries will continue with the dubious pledges of a few, now irrelevant, politicians? See links under After Paris and Below the Bottom Line. *************** Ignore the Obvious: The director of the Energy, Climate Justice, and Sustainability Lab and a research professor at New York University’s School of Professional Studies authored an essay in the Wall Street Journal that exemplifies the approach some academics take about “climate change” and the phony “climate crisis.” In “Five Ways to Disaster-Proof the Energy Grid: With extreme weather events—and power outages—on the rise, utilities and tech companies are looking at what they can do to keep the lights on in the future” the author ignores that the claim of rising extreme weather events is refuted by physical evidence. Her five approaches are: 1) Better prediction using AI; 2) Better batteries; 3) Independent microgrids; 4) Better, stronger transmission lines; and 5) Controlling demand. One, will AI allow better predictions? Utilities are well aware of the limitations of their equipment. The problem is better weather prediction. Unfortunately, with NOAA weather prediction is ignored in favor of the fantasy of climate prediction. Then there is the problem of chaos beyond two-week predictions. It may be better to just expect the worse and hope it does not happen. Two, better batteries. Storage of electricity has long been a problem for utilities. In 1907 pumped hydro storage was used on a small scale in Switzerland. In 1930 it was used in the US by the Connecticut Electric and Power Company. The largest US facility is the Dominion Electric Bath County, VA, plant. In the summer, the system needs replenishment each weekend from reliable power plants. On the utility scale, batteries remain a dream, not a reality. Three: independent microgrids. This works for hospitals etc. if they provide on-site storage of fuel needed for generation. But microgrids do not work for the general public. As seen in the last major winter storm that brought down the Texas grid, just in time delivery of natural gas does not work. The fuel must be available on site. Wind power failed and promised wind resistant solar panels are of little use at night. Four: better, stronger transmission lines: They are always a goal, but require maintenance. Environmental advocates object to cutting back vegetation to protect the transmission and distribution lines. Five: Controlling demand: This is always the favorite of authoritarians. They, not the public, will decide who will get electricity and when. It may work in an authoritarian state but not in a republic with certain personal rights enshrined in its Constitution. What the author ignores is that wind and solar are unreliable and add to the fragility of the grid making it more subject to disruption in severe weather events. See Article #2 *************** Number of the Week: 2,000 years ago. According to Matt Ridley, the city of Aragon [actually Zaragoza], Spain, was recently saved by a dam built by the emperor Augustus. Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus, also known as Octavian, reigned as the first Roman emperor from 27 BC until his death in AD 14. Apparently, the Romans knew of the dangers of flooding in eastern Spain over 2,000 years ago. And such flooding is called extreme weather brought on by recent climate change? [That was during the infamous Roman warm period, which was even warmer than the Medieval warm period, which was even warmer than today.] See links under Changing Weather.

Nov 12, 2024 The Global Carbon Budget report, produced by an international team of more than 120 scientists, provides an annual, peer-reviewed update, building on established methodologies in a fully transparent manner. The 2024 edition (the 19th annual report) will be published in the journal Earth System Science Data on November 13 as a pre-print, and later as a peer-reviewed paper. From the article: For example, India’s emissions, which are projected to be about equal to those of the EU this year, will increase by about 5 percent over their 2023 levels. And the amount of methane and carbon dioxide rising from the rest of the world — which accounts for roughly the same share of global emissions as China and the EU combined — is on track to rise by about 1 percent.

That needs to stop whether NOAA is broken up or not as it is a built-in conflict of interest with scientific ethics. Meanwhile, the NWS is so money-poor it can’t even launch routine weather balloons in all of the locations where needed. Ten million dollars would alleviate that problem.

We conclude that these long-term changes in oceanographic parameters may still be too small to have a measurable impact on shoreline recession/progradation and that primary drivers such as ambient imbalances in the coastal sediment budget may be masking any such linkages.

Plankton are the backbone of the ocean — and may struggle with what’s coming A pair of papers in the journal Nature shows how plankton are struggling to survive in warming seas. By Dino Grandoni, The Washington Post, November 13, 2024 [H/t Jim Buell} Links not given, one probable link: Past foraminiferal acclimatization capacity is limited during future warming By Rui Ying, et al., Nature, Nov 13, 2024 From abstract: However, when forcing the trait-based plankton model with rapid transient warming over the coming century (1.5 °C, 2 °C, 3 °C and 4 °C relative to pre-industrial baseline), the model suggests that the acclimatization capacities of all ecogroups are limited and insufficient to track warming rates. From the article: To assess future impacts of warming waters on plankton, Schmidt and her colleagues turned to ancient changes. The team analyzed an extensive fossil record of a type of plankton called foraminifera, which leave behind tiny shells that fall to the seafloor when they die. Even for those who forgo eating fish, plankton are crucial for preventing climate change from getting even worse than it is. When foraminifera form their shells, they bind carbon with calcium to make their building material. After they die, the shells fall to the seafloor, locking that carbon out of the atmosphere for eons. [SEPP Comment: The assumptions are false.

Some areas, for example in Essex and Kent, were simply exploited for their natural resources to produce salt and support seasonal grazing. Parts of Fenland were also used in this way, though the higher coastal siltlands were modified through the creation of drainage systems in order to improve agricultural opportunities within a landscape that was still liable to tidal flooding.

Roman roads in Britannia were initially designed for military use, they were constructed by the legions during the four centuries that Britannia was a province of the Roman Empire. Some Roman routes form part of the national road network, today. One has, I think, to reflect a little on a time when things got improved in a major way in a relatively short period of time – albeit under Roman occupation – because we are now in a period where things are going into reverse. And deliberately so. The Romans would hold games – somewhat barbaric by ‘today’s standards’ – to entertain the masses. “”“While gladiators have always captured the public imagination, their presence in Britain has been less widely understood. New research has now proven that the spectacles of Rome’s Colosseum were experienced as far away as Colchester.”” https://www.britishmuseum.org/sites/default/files/2024-08/Gladiators-of-Britain.pdf The current elites feed us a constant diet of doom and gloom throughout the spheres “”I’ve dabbled in prepping before, without really realising what I was doing. A fear in the early 2000s that Rimmel might stop making my favourite eyeliner led to me dashing to Boots to buy five. Which is fairly normal, I think? On the spectrum of normal? … The Doomsday Clock is now set at 90 seconds to midnight. Its operators, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, who monitor the combined risks of nuclear annihilation, climate disaster, biological threat and “disruptive technologies”, say we have never been closer to global catastrophic destruction. I’m finally into ‘prepping’ and ready for the apocalypse https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2024/nov/17/im-finally-into-prepping-and-ready-for-the-apocalypse What will Miliband do for us? To recap… The following SEPP comment is silly on a couple of counts. “There is no explanation on how the heavy CFC molecules get from the surface to the stratosphere. (CCI2F2 [Freon] has an atomic weight of about 121 atomic mass units (amu)).” Gases fill the volume of their container basically due to entropy. Refrigerants are gases. Less volatile gases will migrate (diffuse) more slowly, but mixing occurs in the atmosphere due to winds, thermals, etc. “Atomic” refers to atoms, “molecular” refers to molecules. The molecular weight of a Freon is the sum of its atomic constituents. “According to Matt Ridley, the city of Aragon [actually Zaragoza], Spain, was recently saved by a dam built by the emperor Augustus.” The ancients had good engineers. My uncle was in southern Iraq during WWII. He said he drove his jeep over a stone bridge- a sign next to it said it was built by Alexander the Great! So, why do you think NPR published this bit of news? When will greenhouse gas emissions finally peak? Could be soon “For almost two centuries, greenhouse gas emissions have climbed steadily as humans have burned increasing amounts of oil, gas and coal. Now, climate scientists believe those emissions may finally be reaching a peak…” No time to follow the link yet but I’m guessing its a combo of technologically driven energy efficiency increases, economically driven population growth decreases and wishful thinking. As to why they’d publish a “don’t worry” piece, I think they see the writing on the wall. It’s over? The current temperature spike is about over, so there’s certainly an opportunity to take credit — even is none is due. Okay started reading it… “Studies show emissions must peak and then rapidly decline to limit impacts like more intense heat waves and storms.” Stopped there. “more intense heat waves and storms” Goebbels would be proud of the Climate Fascists. “This “backward” nation has planned 100 space launches for 2024 in its goal to put someone on the Moon by 2030.” I think above words were written intending to be ironic but “Neil Armstrong famously said, “That’s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind” on July 20, 1969, as he became the first person to walk on the moon” That was 55 years ago. The famous American astronaut has been dead for about 8 years. American businessmen have gone to space, because, why not? Going to the moon was a technology goal for days gone by, and now that most people believe it really happened 5 decades ago, the natural response would not be “wow!” but rather “why?” Pushing a rope uphill. https://www.reuters.com/technology/northvolt-files-chapter-11-bankruptcy-us-2024-11-21/ Login Become a WUWT Sponsor - click here Free signup if you want to post comments (includes ads) click here “Walk toward the fire.
