Title: Target Stock To $45?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Target (NYSE: TGT) has already decreased approximately 40% over the past year. This decline is painful, yet not entirely unexpected. Earnings growth has stagnated, competition is increasing, and the company is getting ready for a change in leadership. Q2 2025 brought a slight earnings beat, but the broader scenario remains one of sluggish sales and shrinking margins. Why is Another 50% Drop Possible? Target's performance during downturns should raise concerns for investors. The stock declined by 60.6% in the inflation shock from 2021 to 2023, while the S&P 500 experienced a 25.4% drop. It decreased 29% during Covid, slightly outperforming the market, but in the financial crisis, it fell 63.8% compared to 56.8% for the S&P. In summary, Target has a history of underperforming when consumer spending tightens. The stock has dropped over 10% in the past month. Could it decline further? Yes. From our perspective, three factors could converge to push shares down to $45—a decrease of about 50% from current levels: revenues, margins, and valuation. Target does have the potential for recovery, but its past performance, current fundamentals, and relative positioning indicate that the downside scenario should be taken seriously. However, investing in a single stock carries significant risk. The Trefis High Quality Portfolio is designed to mitigate stock-specific risks while providing exposure to upside potential. Additionally, see What’s Next For ANF Stock? Target's sales have been declining. Over the last three years, revenue has fallen at an average rate of 0.3%. FY 2024 reported $106 billion, a 0.7% decrease from the previous year. The latest quarter recorded another 0.8% decline. For further information, see: TGT Revenue Comparison Why? Discretionary demand remains low. Inflation has nudged shoppers towards value, benefiting Walmart (NYSE: WMT) for groceries and Costco (NASDAQ: COST) for bulk buys. Target's reliance on apparel, home goods, and electronics—categories currently under strain—has worsened the situation. Inventory misjudgments in 2022 led to heavy markdowns that hurt both sales momentum and profitability. Digital growth, which was once a strength, has decelerated since the pandemic. The upcoming CEO shift in FY2026 brings execution risk. The planned conclusion of the Ulta partnership removes a source of traffic in beauty. Meanwhile, Walmart and Costco continue to gain shares in groceries and traffic, leaving Target squeezed in the mid-market. Collectively, these pressures impact comparable store sales, brand relevance, and digital uptake—key factors for long-term growth expectations. Profitability is also declining. The operating margin averaged 5.4% over the last year, with free cash flow margin at 6.2% and net margin at 4.0%. These figures lag behind broader retail benchmarks. Why? A shift in sales mix towards lower-margin essentials, ongoing cost inflation, and continued shrinkage have all contributed. To maintain traffic, Target has relied on promotions, which have diminished pricing power. The gross margin was 29% in Q2, down from 30% the previous year. A retreat toward pandemic lows of 25–26% would reduce operating income by roughly 40%. At today’s price of $92 per share, Target is exposed to substantial downside risk if its fundamentals weaken. Suppose revenues contract by approximately 2% annually through 2026, discretionary spending continues to be subdued, and gross margins revert to 25–26% (from 29%) due to markdowns, wage inflation, and shrinkage. In that scenario, operating income could decline by roughly 40% compared to FY2024 levels. Net income may reduce from $4 billion ($8.86 per share) in 2024 to about $2.2 billion ($5 per share) in 2026—representing a 45% decrease. Markets seldom reward declining earnings. If sentiment deteriorates and investors reassess Target’s valuation closer to struggling department stores at 8x earnings—down from the current 11x multiple—the implied equity value would be around $45 per share. This reflects about a 50% downside from current levels. Timing remains uncertain. This scenario could develop over two years or four—but the risk is tangible if sales and margins continue to erode while competitors strengthen their positions. The forthcoming third-quarter results will serve as an early indicator: any stabilization in comparable store sales or gross margin might alleviate some pressure, but if weaknesses continue, investor skepticism is likely to rise. Progress may require time, but maintaining patience should yield results. Target’s advantage lies in its affordable, style-centric private labels. By enhancing these through improved merchandising and digital execution, the company has a clear pathway to success. Our analysis suggests that a favorable outcome is probable, although it may necessitate that both investors and customers adopt a long-term perspective. You might consider exploring the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to generate solid returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks offered a responsive approach to maximize gains during favorable market conditions while minimizing losses when markets decline, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Consumer Gasoline Costs Lowest In 20 Years: EIA
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidblackmon/2025/09/10/consumer-gasoline-costs-lowest-in-20-years-eia/
Time Published: 2025-09-10T13:19:21Z

ByDavid Blackmon, Senior Contributor. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) reports in its September Short Term Energy Outlook that this year’s cost of gasoline for U.S. drivers is the lowest since at least 2005 as a share of disposable income. That bit of good news for consumers and the Trump White House is but one of a wealth of interesting data points contained in this latest EIA report. As is pretty much always the case, this year’s drop in the price for gas at the pump has trended in step with a similar downturn in crude oil prices. After reaching a January high of almost $79 per barrel, the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) index price has dropped by over 20% to its current level of roughly $63/bbl. Wholesale gas prices have shown a similar drop from an early February peak of about $2.38 per gallon, falling to $1.99/gallon as of this writing. Diesel fuel prices have followed a similar path since January. That’s another bit of positive news for consumer prices since basically all food, clothing and other consumer goods are transported from factories to market via ships, planes, trucks, and trains which run on some variant of Diesel fuel. More good consumer news comes in the EIA’s projection that further reductions in energy prices remain ahead in the months to come. “We expect the Brent crude oil price will decline significantly in the coming months, falling from $68 per barrel (b) in August to $59/b on average in the fourth quarter of 2025 (4Q25) and around $50/b in early 2026,” EIA analysts say, predicting another 25% drop in crude prices from current levels. That magnitude of additional price reductions would be supportive of President Donald Trump’s recent statement that he expects gas prices to fall into the $2/gallon range in the coming months. While the current national average retail price for regular gasoline is $3.19 according to AAA, that is inflated by much higher prices in high tax states like California, Oregon, and Illinois. Gas prices are closer to $2.70 in low price states like Texas, Louisiana, and Alabama. While low oil prices are never good news for oil-focused drilling companies, EIA says there is good news on the horizon for upstream companies looking to produce more natural gas. “We expect the Henry Hub natural gas spot price will rise from an average of $2.91 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) in August to $3.70/MMBtu in 4Q25 and $4.30/MMBtu next year,” EIA analysts say, a rosy price projection that has been pretty rare across the last 16 years. Natural gas prices in the U.S. have for the most part been range-bound between $2/MMBtu and $4/MMBtu since 2009. The lone fairly long-term exception to that paradigm came in the post-COVD world in 2022-early 2023, when chronic supply chain and work force issues caused a temporary supply shortage. Otherwise, the sheer magnitude of America’s natural gas resource has enabled drillers to quickly overwhelm temporary spikes in prices by activating a number of additional drillings and driving prices back down with higher production volumes. With just 110-120 active rigs currently targeting natural gas formations, it is a safe bet that upstream companies would quickly create a similar supply response should domestic gas prices run back up past the $4/MMBtu level as EIA projects. Anticipating this enduring reality, EIA analysts say they “expect drilling activity in the United States to be more centered in natural gas-intensive producing regions in 2026.” These and other data points contained in this EIA report are consistent with the Trump White House’s goal of cutting energy costs to consumers as a major element in reducing the rate of inflation. At the same time, however, the daily news is becoming increasingly cluttered with reports of layoffs taking place in the oil and gas industry and major service companies which deliver another leg of Trump’s agenda: That of American Energy Dominance. As I pointed out here shortly after last November’s elections, it was never likely that this second Trump presidency would become a replay of the “drill, baby, drill” boom that took place during his first term in office from 2017-2021. The maturity in the development of the big U.S. shale plays, combined with strategies by the bigger corporate drillers to focus more capital resources on increased dividends and stock buyback programs would eliminate that possibility. Good news for U.S. gasoline consumers almost always means bad news for oil and gas producers. What this latest EIA Outlook illustrates as much as anything else is that inherent tension in these two major facets of the Trump energy agenda remains alive and well.

Title: I've used the Dreame U20 for months and it still surprises me how well this affordable cordless vacuum cleans pet hair

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. If you're after a budget vacuum that's capable of handling messes – especially pet-made ones – the U20 is one to consider. Even without industry-leading suction, it cleans hard floors well and is extremely maneuverable. Moreover, its classy color scheme makes it look more premium than it costs. The lack of a display to gauge battery life is my only gripe but, again, it's hard to fault at the U20's affordable price point. Great value for money Good suction for hair and fur Lightweight & easy to maneuvre Useful attachments, including a wall mount Headlight on cleaning head is a nice touch No LCD display Average battery life Small dustbin Longer recharging time Why you can trust TechRadar We spend hours testing every product or service we review, so you can be sure you're buying the best. Find out more about how we test. Hailing from parent company, Xiaomi, Dreame is fast becoming a popular sub-brand with an extensive product lineup. Ranging from wet-dry vacuums, air purifiers, robot vacuums (including a robot lawnmower), cordless stick vacuums and hair dryers, Dreame has it all, and across different budgets, too. While its high-end robovacs are items to dream about (pun intended), as you can see in our Dreame X50 Ultra review, I’m in love with a much cheaper product that helps me clean up after my pets. The affordable Dreame U20 has become my lifesaver, combining Dyson-like tech with the signature Dreame style. It’s a versatile and lightweight cordless vacuum that delivers great performance for an exceptionally low cost, as it’s very frequently discounted. Its color scheme belies its budget price point – available in a gorgeous gold and beige colourway, the Dreame U20 looks far more premium than its $249.99 / £250 / AU$399.99 price point suggests. What I found even more impressive is its suction. For the price, its 120AW power isn’t bad at all, which isn’t too far off the Shark Cordless Detect Pro’s 123AW of suction, and yet it was more than enough to clean my pup’s fur off my sofa and carpets well. Needless to say, it handles hard floors very easily, making it a candidate for being one of the best cordless vacuum cleaners. It comes with the standard attachments, including a multi-surface brush head with LED blue lights to illuminate dark areas, a mini motorized brush for cleaning upholstery, a crevice tool and a removable battery that's rated for up to 60 minutes. Realistically, though, you'll get no more 37-40 minutes when using the two motorized attachments on the lowest suction, but that's fine for smaller homes – I can easily vacuum my living area, two bedrooms and two bathrooms within that time. However, if you mostly have carpets, I found it can take longer to get it clean as you may need to go back and forth a few times, thus consuming more battery. The only battery indicator on the U20 is a tiny light on the end cap, which is hard to see while in use, and it blinks when it’s running low. There’s also no quick charging here, and the vacuum can take up to 3.5 hours to fully recharge. The only other downside to this otherwise great buy is that the dustbin capacity is only 0.5L, meaning you might need to empty it frequently if you have a large home with pets. If you don't need any more bells and whistles, the Dreame U20 is easy to recommend as a top-notch budget cordless vacuum cleaner. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. The Dreame U20 can be picked up in the US at Target for a list price of $249.99. It’s also available on Instacart, with supplies stocked at Costco and other smaller retailers. It is currently not available on Dreame's US store. In the UK, the list price is £250, and you can pick it up from Amazon UK or Curry's, but again, the vacuum is currently unavailable at the brand's UK store. For customers living in Australia, Amazon AU lists it for AU$399.99, but it's typically discounted to AU$199.99. Even in Australia, the U20 isn't available on the Dreame website. The Dreame website lists 27 countries where its devices are available, including the U20. If you're having trouble finding the product, check their website to see if it's available where you live. Even at full price, the Dreame U20 represents superb value for money, particularly if you can find it at a discounted price. Admittedly it's a very basic model, so if you want a touch more suction, Dreame has other mid-range models, with the Dreame R20 review scoring very well for balancing price and performance. Type: Cordless stick vacuum Bagless: Yes Weight: 7.27 lbs / 3.3kg Bin size: 0.5 liters / 500ml Max runtime: 60 mins Charge time: 3.5 hours Tools: Multi-surface brush head, motorized mini brush head, wide combination crevice tool and extension rod Power: 120AW I’m new to the world of vacuum testing, with just one other for sister site Tom’s Guide under my belt. Needless to say, the Dreame U20 has been quite the dream, especially when it came to design. For me, the gold and beige colorway was a winner, a stray away from the typical grey or black of other competitors. It lends the affordable vacuum a classy look. Other than that, the Dreame U20 has a stock-standard design which allows it to become a handheld unit quickly for cleaning cars, sofas, mattresses and, hey, even dog beds. To pair with the handheld unit, there’s a motorized mini brush in the box that would be handy for said dog bed and the sofa. It could even be used on carpeted stairs. It has a trigger, like most Dyson models, but you don’t need to keep this pressed at all times to run the machine – you just need to click it on and off. There’s just one other control button on the motor’s end cap to change suction modes and that should be easy to reach for most users with the thumb when holding the U20. The main floor-cleaning attachment is called the Multi-Surface Brush, which features LED blue lights that help illuminate the floor in front of the brush head but don’t highlight miniscule dust particles like Dyson’s Fluffy tool does. And that’s OK because it still helps you see in dark areas – for example, I was able to see scattered kitty litter in an unlit bathroom. The other attachment in the box is a combination crevice tool, but a wall-mount kit also ships with the vacuum in case you want to stow it away in a convenient place without compromising floor space. Weighing 3.3kg / 7.27lbs, the Dreame U20 isn't exactly lightweight (in comparison, the Shark Cordless Detect Pro weighs 2.7kg / 5.9lbs), but it's still very easy to push around. It measures 16cm x 30cm x 68cm with the extension rod attached. The 120AW motor is capable of running at three different speed modes, indicated by three lights on the end cap of the motor. You can switch between the speed settings (low, medium and high) by tapping the button directly below the lights and switching it on by using the trigger. For most cleans, I found I tended to flick between medium and high, especially when cleaning carpets. According to Dreame, the U20 motor has a multi-layer filtration system that captures up to 99.9% of fine dust and particles. Its HEPA filter also keeps debris out of the air and inside the bin while vacuuming, which is pretty standard for any cordless vacuum cleaner these days. For its price point, the 0.5L bin is quite standard, but it'll likely fill up fast if you have, say, a two-bedroom or larger home with pets, meaning you'll need to make more trips to empty it. The bin has a handy sticker on the front (which I did refer back to many times) that indicates how to insert or remove it to empty, and its as simple as pushing the button on the base and twisting the canister clockwise. After detaching, all you have to do is unscrew the filter from the container to remove the debris – finer dust or crumbs fall out easily, but you may need to get your fingers inside to remove clumps of hair from the bin. The detachable battery pack could be handy for some users as you can clip it into the wall-mount attachment and begin charging it while you’re emptying the vacuum for example. However, if you’re a renter who can't drill holes into your wall – like me – you can leave the battery attached to the U20 and keep the vacuum propped up against a wall or in a cupboard for topping up. It lacks an LCD screen to show suction modes or time remaining before the next charge. Instead, the battery life is displayed by a small vertical light on the pack itself, which flashes when it needs charging. It's unfortunate that it faces forward, so it’s not visible to the user, and neither is it a very noticeable light – and this is my biggest complaint with the Dreame U20 as there were a few instances where the machine shut down mid-clean during my testing. The U20’s multi-surface brush head is quite similar to many floor-cleaning attachments from other brands, but it features blue LED lights on the front that illuminate two small triangular sections of the floor immediately in front of the brush head. While it looks similar to Dyson’s green dust-illuminating light on the Fluffy Optic, this blue light doesn’t highlight invisible dust on the floor, but I found it’s bright and vivid enough to help walk around in a dark room without bumping into things. Case in point: it perfectly showed scattered kitty litter in an unlit bathroom that was, at the time, pitch dark. The brush also has V-shaped bristles with comb-like teeth – in my experience, this not only prevents tangles effectively, but can pick up human hair and pet fur from low-pile carpets just as well. This brush head is quite flexible, rotating 90º around chair legs and furniture. It’s also not as large as you’d find on other (more expensive) vacuum cleaners and I found it can get into corners, which is particularly helpful in my pet hair-filled home. My favorite attachment, however, is the motorized mini brush, which clips in just under the bin for handheld use. It’s just right for sucking up fur from my couch and cushions – it’s both maneuvrable and anti-tangle. If it wasn’t for the missing display to check battery life, I’d say that Dreame would deserve top marks for the U20’s design. I've spent a few months with the Dreame U20 (as of publishing this review) and I still can’t get over how impressive its maneuverability is. The 90º rotating main brush head makes it very easy to clean around chair legs and furniture and I had no trouble handling the 3.3kg / 7.2lbs vacuum. That said, if you are using the extension tube to clean ceiling corners, the U20 could begin to feel heavy for some users quickly. The controls are well placed, which are as simple as pushing the end cap button to select the speed and hitting the trigger underneath. And as I’ve mentioned previously, there’s no need to keep the latter depressed continuously for power like a Dyson. Speaking of power: sure, we could ask for higher suction than its 120AW, but given its price point, it’s hard to argue with what it has. If you do need better performance, you could consider the Dreame R20 (if it’s available where you live), but I found the U20 does an admirable job nonetheless. It can struggle on some carpets as you will need to go over a particular spot multiple times to get a deeper clean, and I've found myself needing to push with full shoulder force on occasion. Throughout my testing, the Dreame U20 impressed in more ways than one. I performed TechRadar’s standard tests for vacuum cleaners, sprinkling a smattering of oats and tea from a bag on both my hardwood and carpeted floors. As an extra measure, I also made sure the floors had extra pet debris – i.e. kitty litter and fur – which were my two motivations for purchasing the U20 in the first place. During the hardwood mess test, the U20 performed remarkably well on the lowest speed setting in picking up most of the oats. I needed to boost the speed to the second (or medium) setting to do another pass to pick up every last speck of oats, though, but that left the hard floor entirely clean. As for the tea, the U20 did a better job, sucking it all up in one go on the low setting, so it handles lighter and smaller dirt better than larger debris. It was the same for pet hair on hardwood – all strands got sucked up in one pass on the low setting. The vacuum struggled a touch with kitty litter, leaving a few specks behind on hard floors in a single pass, but it was cleaned up in the second go. I wasn’t expecting as impressive a performance on carpets, but the U20 did better than I had anticipated on a low-pile carpet in my tests, quickly removing the oats and tea dust from a bag in one pass on the low suction setting. It will, however, struggle with medium and high-pile carpets, particularly if the dust and debris is deep-seated, although loose dirt will come away if you give the area a few gos with the U20. In terms of pet hair on carpet, the U20 did indeed struggle at the lowest setting, leaving more than a few strands behind after the first pass. The U20 performed the best with pet hair on the same low-pile carpet at maximum suction, and didn't require several passes to get the job done. The kitty litter yielded a similar result to the hardwood floor test, but I needed to boost suction again to pick up every last piece. While it can tackle low-pile carpets with ease, pet hair embedded in medium- or high-pile carpets will remain even after several passes – you can expect about 80% off the fur to be sucked up from these kinds of flooring. As a pet mum, it was important to me to own a vacuum cleaner with a tangle-free brush, as I’ve often painstakingly cleaned out wads of hair from cleaning attachments of older machines. I was thrilled to find that the U20's V-shaped bristles were especially impressive at leaving no evidence of entanglements. That's made ongoing maintenance of the vacuum easier. This sentiment also rang true for the mini motor brush when cleaning my couch and cushions. It does, however, require several passes when using the handheld motor and mini brush to clean up pet hair due to its smaller footprint, but it still worked a treat. The U20 collects a nice volume of hair in its 0.5L bin, and I have particularly enjoyed how easy it is to empty the bin with a twist of the base. If you are a pet owner with a shedding furry friend, then I would recommend the U20 for a quick, daily tidy-up, but you might want to consider other pet-focused vacuum cleaners, like the Shark Stratos Pet Pro (IZ400), as they usually have a larger-capacity bin and boast more suction power. Despite its relatively lower suction and smaller bin, the U20 performs very well, given its budget price – it's very easy to recommend for quick clean-ups. According to Dreame, the U20 has a battery life of up to 60 minutes on a full charge, and takes around 3.5 hours to top up from practically empty. Take that number with a pinch of salt, as it indicates runtime when using non-motorized tools, which in this case is the combination crevice attachment only. With a motorized head like the main floor cleaner and the mini brush, I found that it lasts a maximum of 37 minutes on its lowest setting – and there’s no dynamic suction here to drain the battery faster. At TechRadar, we've tested over a hundred vacuum cleaners over the last decade, and we've found that the average battery life for a budget cordless vacuum is around 40 minutes, which puts the U20 on par with others, including the Dyson V8 . Higher the suction, the faster the battery will drain, of course and, in testing, I got about 17 minutes of runtime on a full charge when set to maximum. That’s not bad, considering some premium models like the Dyson V15 Detect can give you lesser runtime on Boost mode (about 8 minutes on a dirty mid-pile carpet), although it automatically adjusts suction power to suit the amount of dirt it detects. So while the U20 has average battery runtime, I’d recommend it for smaller homes or something for the shed, perhaps. Attribute Notes Rating Value Often on sale, the U20 is an excellent budget option with great performance. 5/5 Design The color combination makes it look premium, and its attachments are useful. It would have been good if there was a better way to gauge battery life. 4/5 Performance Great for everyday, quick cleaning, even of pet hair, on hard floors and low-pile carpets, but it may struggle on particularly dirty mid- and high-pile carpets. 4.5/5 Battery Rated for up to 60 minutes, but expect about 35 minutes in real-world use on low power. 4/5 You need something to quickly clean up after your pet The U20 handled masses of pet hair quite well, thanks to its V-shaped multi-surface brush head. You want something easy to maneuver It might be heavier than the likes of the Shark Cordless Detect Pro (which weighs around 2.7kg / 5.9lbs), but its swivelling main brush head makes it very easy to move around, particularly on hard floors. You live in a large home With average battery life for its price point, the U20 is better suited for smaller areas or homes that don't require extensive vacuuming. You want the latest vacuuming tech The U20 doesn't house the most advanced features, it even misses out on an LED screen to display battery life. If you don’t want something this basic, you’ll need to look elsewhere and spend more money. Product: Dreame U20 (reviewed) Shark Cordless Detect Pro Dyson V8 Weight: 7.27lbs / 3.3kg 6lbs / 2.7kg 3.48lbs / 1.58kg Bin volume: 0.5L 0.4L 0.54L Max runtime: 60 mins 40 mins 40 mins Accessories: Multi-surface brush head, motorized mini brush head, wide combination crevice tool and extension rod Duster, crevice tool, optional auto-empty dock (costs extra) 2 x floorheads, Hair screw tool, Combination tool, Crevice tool Shark Cordless Detect Pro The Shark Cordless Detect Pro costs a lot more than the U20, but it has better suction and, you can opt for the additional auto-emptying dock, which is handy as the onboard bin canister here is very small. However, it's often discounted and, until it was displaced by the Shark PowerDetect, it used to be our pick of the best cordless vacuum for most people. Read our full Shark Cordless Detect Pro review Dyson V8 Despite receiving a newer upgrade in September 2025, the older Dyson V8 is still a strong choice, especially since this too can be had for a good discount. It boast good performance and suction, with up to 40 minutes of runtime on its standard setting. It's extremely lightweight at 1.58kg / 3.48lbs, but it lacks some of the useful features of newer Dyson models, and it might not always represent the best value for everyone. Read our full Dyson V8 review TechRadar adopts a strict testing regime for all its products so potential buyers know exactly what they're getting. To comply with the testing, I used the machine for a few months before putting it through some rigorous carpet and hard-floor tests using common pantry items, such as tea and raw oats. I also took into account the device's ergonomics, design and overall experience to determine my final verdict.
