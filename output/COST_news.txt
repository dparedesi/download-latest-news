BySergei Klebnikov, Forbes Staff. What do you do when 96% of your revenue comes from coconut water and 100% of your supply comes from tropical countries targeted by Donald Trump with high tariffs? This is exactly the situation confronting one of the nation’s hottest small cap companies today, $516 million (revs) Vita-Coco of New York City, the leading maker of coconut water. Its biggest source of coconuts, has heretofore been Brazil, a country now squarely in the crosshairs of a proposed 50% tariff, courtesy of the Trump administration. Its six other sources for coconuts aren’t much better: Philippines (tariff:19%), Malaysia (25%), Vietnam (32%), Indonesia (32%) Thailand (36%) and Sri Lanka (46%). Still, you wouldn’t know that Vita Coco was facing a Trump tariff nightmare given the company’s bullish tone—or its stock performance. Shares are up nearly 32% over the past 12 months, outperforming many better-known consumer-staples names. Even with the stock down roughly 5% year-to-date as the broader market rallies, Wall Street is shrugging off Vita Coco’s inevitable pricing pressure. “Brazil is really a nonissue for us,” insists co-founder and executive chairman Michael Kirban. “We started working on reallocating our Brazil supply, which historically goes to the United States, to supply Europe and Canada, several weeks ago.” The main source of supply for Europe, meanwhile—the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Malaysia—will now all shift to the U.S. “This is something we can pull the trigger on really quickly,” reasons Kirban, seemingly unconcerned about the high tariffs in his alternative source countries. He goes on: “With decreasing ocean freight rates and pricing [increases] we took earlier this year to mitigate the initial 10% baseline tariffs, we think we are in a good position.” Co-founder Kirban says he doesn’t expect to pass any further price hikes in the coming months, but this may be wishful thinking if Trump doesn't back away from his harsh tariffs on tropical countries. Here is what Vita Coco CEO Martin Roper said on the Q2 earnings call held a few weeks ago: “Our planned U.S.-based price increase in May to cover inflationary cost of goods pressures produced an approximately 7% increase at U.S. food retailers according to Circana over the quarter.” However the May price increase does not include another recent price increase implemented in the current quarter, which Vita Coco management refuses to provide Forbes details on. For now, Wall Street is putting its faith in Vita Coco management. By working with seven of the largest coconut processors in the world, Vita Coco currently controls roughly 40% of the U.S. coconut-water market, far ahead of smaller competitors like Goya and Harmless Harvest. “Coca-Cola tried to enter this market, buying Zico, and Pepsi also failed,” Larry Carlin, an equity analyst at $8 billion (assets) Conestoga Capital Advisors who is hopeful that Vita Coco’s strong position will give it more flexibility in the face of looming tariffs. “They’ve developed a supply chain with substantial barriers to entry,” adds Carlin. Founded by two friends in 2003 after a chance bar room encounter in Manhattan, Vita Coco’s met with early success in its first decade, thanks in part to celebrity investors including Madonna, Demi Moore, and Matthew McConnaghy. However about a decade into their journey growing pains hit—thin margins, distribution hiccups and a rocky 2021 IPO kept many institutions away. But over the past two years the company has executed a disciplined turnaround, tightening its supply chain after the Covid pandemic. It has also expanded its portfolio of offerings into protein-infused PWR LIFT, aluminum-canned Ever & Ever water, and most recently, the coconut-milk-based beverage line Vita Coco Treats. Up until the onslaught of Trump’s tariffs, Vita-Coco was the envy of the Russell 2000, appearing near the top of Forbes Best Small Companies ranking in 2024. The stock is up 133% since its IPO, and five-fold from its low in 2022. On the company’s second quarter earnings call, held July 30th, CFO Corey Baker noted that Vita Coco is pursuing a formal tariff exemption request with U.S. trade officials. If that isn’t granted, management basically told shareholders to brace themselves: “If [the 50% Brazilian tariff is] enacted, we would ultimately need to pass through price increases,” says Baker. “Even under a worst-case scenario, we believe we could pass through price if necessary while maintaining share.” On Wall Street, six of the ten analysts covering Vita Coco rate it a “buy”, while the other four give it a “hold” rating, often interpreted as “sell” by investors. Short sellers have begun to circle its stock. A 23-page March 2025 report by UK-based short-seller NINGI Research accused Vita Coco of numerous underlying business problems including failed attempts at diversification, supply chain foul ups and millions in CEO and insider stock sales. NINGI’s main argument was that the company was an unsustainable growth story: “Vita Coco is nothing more than a one-trick pony" and an "operational basket case,” it wrote. The report's most impactful claims were that Vita Coco had lost its large private-label contract with Costco due to supply chain mismanagement, which would lead to a significant revenue hit. While Vita Coco publicly refuted the report as containing "inaccuracies and mischaracterizations," subsequent public statements and financial results support NINGI’s allegations about the lost Costco contract. The company's Q2 2025 earnings report confirmed a significant 36.5% decline in private-label sales; What’s more, Costco now appears to have stopped selling Vita Coco and is instead stocking its own coconut water under its in-house private label brand, Kirkland Signature. Today, a 12-pack of Costco's own Kirkland coconut water sells for $12.99 versus $19.59 for a 12 pack of Vita Coco at Target. Vita Coco has also publicly acknowledged that inventory constraints in 2024 led to "unacceptable private label service levels." Despite these issues, Vita Coco bulls maintain that the company’s core branded coconut water business is strong. Ever the optimist, Kirban is unfazed. “Sales are continuing to perform really nicely. So I think consumers are willing to pay,” says Kirban, referring to his tariff related price hikes. “This is a product that comes from a tree. It's not created in a lab, and it is three and a half times the electrolytes of the leading sport drink.”

Title: The High Cost Of Ditching DEI: What Target’s Boycott Fallout Reveals

ByJanice Gassam Asare, Ph.D., Senior Contributor. It was recently announced that Target’s CEO of 11 years, Brian Cornell, would be stepping down and Michael Fiddelke, 20-year Target veteran and the Chief Operating Officer, would be stepping in to replace him. Target’s stock has seen a considerable decline since the start of 2025. While some have attributed the company’s decline to Trump’s tariffs and the weakening economy, the company’s about-face when it came to DEI sparked backlash and criticism, leaving a bad taste in the mouths of many consumers. In February of 2025, prominent Atlanta pastor Dr. Jamal Bryant called for a boycott of Target in response to the company’s rollback of their DEI initiatives. The boycott, Bryant indicated, has been the most successful Black boycott since the Montgomery Bus Boycott that occurred 70 years ago. DEI is currently the nation’s favorite bogeyman; being blamed for everything from bridge collapses to plane crashes. There is still a lack of understanding regarding what DEI is, how it can positively impact employees and how it can benefit workplaces, contributing to some of the DEI pushback that has increased in recent months. Make no mistake; DEI is far from perfect, but the existence of workplace DEI programs often provides a pathway to address harm that takes place in the workplace. Many Black consumers saw Target’s decision to cut DEI initiatives as a slap in the face. The company was seemingly so outspoken with their support of Black businesses, pledging a $2 billion investment in Black-owned businesses after the murder of George Floyd. Consumers have become much more judicious with their spending, deciding to resist through their wallets. Costco has been an outspoken advocate of DEI, choosing not to flounder under pressure from DEI opponents, and has seen a net increase in sales, which many attribute to their doubling down of DEI. Target drew the public’s ire because unlike many of the companies that announced they were scaling back their DEI efforts in the past year, Target was one of the most ardent supporters of DEI through their racial equity agenda. With Target being headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the company was at ground zero following the tragic murder of George Floyd. The expectation was that their proximity to the tragedy would result in a true commitment to uplift the Black community, but less than five years later, the company reneged on their promises and pledges. In 1969, activist Fred Hampton was instrumental in spearheading the Rainbow Coalition, where different groups of people worked together to address a common issue. What made the coalition so successful is the power in numbers—multiple people working towards a shared goal is an effective way to combat societal ills. During the Montgomery Bus Boycotts, Black folks were able to inspire and mobilize people from outside the Black community to join their cause. What has made the Target boycott so successful has been a similar strategy from the boycott organizers. It hasn’t been only Black consumers who have been boycotting Target. Communities of other historically marginalized and excluded populations (Latinos, poor folks, the LGBTQIA+ community) have also mobilized to support the boycott. Different groups who knew that DEI rollbacks would impact their communities have come together after calls to boycott from leaders like Bryant. There is power in numbers but it’s important to note: when there is a critical mass of people working towards a shared goal, that goal can be accomplished, according to Harvard political scientist Erica Chenoweth. Chenoweth’s research indicated that only 3.5% of a population’s participation is needed to drive change. The question remains whether the hiring of a new CEO will resurrect Target’s image and thus their sales. In a recent CNN interview, Bryant noted that hiring an internal candidate who has been at the company for decades will not change the company’s engrained ideology or their stance on DEI. Contrary to the popular saying, companies that “go woke,” perhaps won’t actually go broke. Companies should learn from Target’s missteps; a commitment to ensuring that all employees are treated equitably and fairly is not a nice-to-have but a need-to-have. Both consumers and employees are watching; if your words don’t align with your actions, there will be a price to pay. Rather than swaying to appease investors, the DEI detractors, or this current administration, the longevity and sustainability of companies will ultimately be decided by how they treat their employees. People are not settling for crumbs—a failure to prioritize the wellbeing of workers will continue to have dire consequences.
