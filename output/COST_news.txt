April 29, 2025 16:19 ET | Source: Orion Group Holdings, Inc. Orion Group Holdings, Inc. HOUSTON, April 29, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Orion Group Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: ORN) (the “Company”), a leading specialty construction company, today reported its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2025. Highlights for the quarter ended March 31, 2025: See definitions and reconciliation of non-GAAP measures elsewhere in this release. Management Commentary “We’re off to a strong start in 2025. On a year-over-year basis, our first quarter revenue increased 17% to $189 million and Adjusted EBITDA doubled. This performance reflects the strength of our operating model and the successful execution of our strategic priorities,” said Travis Boone, Chief Executive Officer of Orion Group Holdings. “By consistently delivering top-tier work and prioritizing safety, we have enhanced our current customer relationships while developing new ones. Year-to-date, we have secured $349 million in new contract awards--$161 million in Marine and $188 million in Concrete, which have started or are scheduled to start within the next few months. We continue to see strong demand across our markets and continue to win repeat business with our world-class partners and clients.” “The future for Orion is extremely bright and our business and operating model is well positioned for this moment. We believe that many of the new federal policy initiatives will support our long-term growth, especially around defense, shipbuilding, infrastructure, and reshoring of manufacturing. Regardless of the efforts to reduce federal spending, we are seeing no impact on domestic infrastructure projects that we are delivering or pursuing, and there has been no pull back on the U.S. government’s China deterrence policy.” “Regarding tariffs, we have been proactively managing tariff risk since last summer and do not expect material impacts to our current projects. Nor do we believe that any actions taken to downsize the federal government will have a material bearing on our business. Therefore, we are reiterating our previous full year 2025 guidance of revenue in the range of $800 million to $850 million with Adjusted EBITDA in the range of $42 million to $46 million. At the same time, we are continuing to prepare for transformational growth in 2026 and beyond,” concluded Boone. First Quarter 2025 Results Contract revenues of $188.7 million increased $28.0 million or 17.4% from $160.7 million in the first quarter last year, primarily due to an increase in revenue from large marine construction contracts and new concrete projects. Gross profit increased to $23.0 million or 12.2% of revenue, up from $15.5 million or 9.7% of revenue in the first quarter of 2024. The increases in gross profit dollars and margin were primarily driven by an improvement in indirect expenses in the marine segment as a result of a higher volume of work, partially offset by lower margins in the concrete segment which were primarily driven by seasonally lower productivity, which is normal for the first quarter. Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses were $22.5 million, up from $19.0 million in the first quarter of 2024. As a percentage of total contract revenues, SG&A expenses increased to 12.0% from 11.8%. The increases in SG&A dollars and percentage reflect an increase in incentive compensation, legal, IT and operating lease expenses. GAAP net loss for the first quarter was $1.4 million ($0.04 per diluted share) compared to a net loss of $6.1 million ($0.19 per diluted share) in the first quarter of 2024. First quarter 2025 net loss included $1.7 million ($0.05 diluted income per share) of non-recurring items. First quarter 2025 adjusted net income was $0.3 million ($0.01 diluted income per share). EBITDA for the first quarter of 2025 was $6.3 million, resulting in a 3.3% EBITDA margin, compared to EBITDA of $3.0 million, and a 1.8% EBITDA margin for the first quarter last year. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter increased to $8.2 million, or a 4.3% Adjusted EBITDA margin. This compares to Adjusted EBITDA of $4.1 million, or a 2.5% Adjusted EBITDA margin for the prior year period. Backlog Total backlog at March 31, 2025 was $839.7 million, compared to $729.1 million at December 31, 2024 and $756.6 million at March 31, 2024. Backlog for the Marine segment was $607.4 million at March 31, 2025, compared to $582.8 million at December 31, 2024 and $569.9 million at March 31, 2024. Backlog for the Concrete segment was $232.3 million at March 31, 2025, compared to $146.3 million at December 31, 2024 and $186.7 million at March 31, 2024. Recent Contract Wins Subsequent to the end of the quarter, the Company has been awarded $51.2 million in new contract wins - $17.1 million in Marine and $34.1 million in Concrete. The Marine wins include a $6.3 million environmental project for General Recycling of Washington and a $7.5 million dredging project for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Galveston District. In Concrete, wins include a $24.1 million project for Phase 2 of the Costco distribution center in Florida, and a $6.6 million project for a United Airlines catering facility at Houston’s George Bush Intercontinental Airport. Balance Sheet Update As of March 31, 2025, current assets were $267.0 million, including unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $13.0 million. Total debt outstanding as of March 31, 2025 was $23.3 million. At the end of the quarter, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility.

Backlog Definition Backlog consists of projects under contract that have either (a) not been started, or (b) are in progress but are not yet complete. The Company cannot guarantee that the revenue implied by its backlog will be realized, or, if realized, will result in earnings. Backlog can fluctuate from period to period due to the timing and execution of contracts. The typical duration of the Company’s projects ranges from three to nine months on shorter projects to multiple years on larger projects. The Company's backlog at any point in time includes both revenue it expects to realize during the next twelve-month period as well as revenue it expects to realize in future years. Non-GAAP Financial Measures This press release includes the financial measures “adjusted net income/loss,” “adjusted earnings/loss per share,” “EBITDA,” "Adjusted EBITDA" and “Adjusted EBITDA margin." These measurements are “non-GAAP financial measures” under rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including Regulation G. The non-GAAP financial information may be determined or calculated differently by other companies that use similarly titled measures. By reporting such non-GAAP financial information, the Company does not intend to give such information greater prominence than comparable GAAP financial information. Investors are urged to consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to and not in substitute for measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted net income/loss and adjusted earnings/loss per share should not be viewed as an equivalent financial measure to net income/loss or earnings/loss per share. Adjusted net income/loss and adjusted earnings/loss per share exclude certain items that management believes are one-time items or items whose timing or amount cannot be reasonably estimated. The Company believes these adjusted financial measures are a useful supplement to earnings/loss calculated in accordance with GAAP. Orion Group Holdings defines EBITDA as net income/loss before net interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by adjusting EBITDA for certain items that management believes are one-time items or items whose timing or amount cannot be reasonably estimated. Adjusted EBITDA margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA for the period by contract revenues for the period. The GAAP financial measure that is most directly comparable to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA is net income, while the GAAP financial measure that is most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA margin is operating margin, which represents operating income divided by contract revenues. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are used internally to evaluate current operating expense, operating efficiency, and operating profitability on a variable cost basis, by excluding the depreciation and amortization expenses, primarily related to capital expenditures and acquisitions, and net interest and tax expenses. Additionally, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin provide useful information regarding the Company's ability to meet future debt service and working capital requirements while providing an overall evaluation of the Company's financial condition. In addition, EBITDA is used internally for incentive compensation purposes. The Company includes EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin to provide transparency to investors as they are commonly used by investors and others in assessing performance. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin have certain limitations as analytical tools and should not be used as a substitute for operating margin, net income, cash flows, or other data prepared in accordance with GAAP, or as a measure of the Company's profitability or liquidity.

Title: Amazon Reportedly Pushing Suppliers for Discounts to Combat Tariffs

Amazon is reportedly looking for steep supplier discounts to offset the cost of U.S. tariffs. As the Financial Times (FT) reported Tuesday (April 29), the tech giant has asked for low double-digit price decreases from merchants in a range of categories, from homeware to consumer electronics. That’s according to a trio of vendor consultants who negotiate on behalf of brands and suppliers. They say Amazon has become more aggressive with suppliers getting goods from China in the wake of the White House’s 145% tariffs on China. “Amazon is the 800-pound gorilla in the room,” Scott Miller, a consultant and former Amazon vendor manager, told the FT. “Brands have grown dependent on the platform and have little choice.” The FT notes that Amazon has joined competitors such as Costco and Walmart in leaning on suppliers to reduce the impact on its profits this year. Goldman Sachs analysts said the tariffs could shave between $5 billion and $10 billion from Amazon’s operating profits this year, depending on the outcome of the trade war. A number of logistics providers and analysts told the FT that Amazon had brought forward shipments after Trump took office in anticipation of increased tariffs. The company also canceled a significant amount of direct imports from China and had switched to purchasing goods from suppliers with American stock, according to two consultants. PYMNTS has contacted Amazon for comment but has not received a reply. The company told the FT it was “working with our broad, varied range of valued selling partners in our store to support them in adapting to the developing environment while maintaining low prices for customers.” The news follows reports from earlier this week that Amazon third-party vendors are choosing to skip this year’s Prime Day sales event due to the tariffs. Meanwhile, new research from PYMNTS Intelligence finds that in the battle between Amazon and rival Walmart, many consumers are opting to patronize both retailers. The research found that nearly a quarter of American adults hold subscriptions to Amazon and Walmart’s membership programs, nearly double 2021’s level. Dual memberships are even more pronounced among millennials, at almost 40%. “The enduring image of Walmart as mainly a grocer and purveyor of basic household goods — and of Amazon as the seller of everything else — is being subtly challenged by the rise of the kaleidoscope consumer seeking savings and satisfaction across both marketplaces, often simultaneously,” PYMNTS wrote in advance of the research.

Title: Expect to Pay More for These Groceries Because of Tariffs

We asked an an expert about which groceries will become more expensive or hard to find as a result of President Trump's tariffs and ongoing trade war. Grocery inflation may rise even further when the tariffs go back into effect. The scope of President Donald Trump's trade war changes by the day. Beyond sending the stock market into disarray and consumer confidence plummeting to 1980s levels, the tariffs are expected to increase inflation to historic highs, particularly in key sectors that center on imports. The global food supply chain is complex, but groceries will be affected by tariffs in a specific way. Due to the climate, some foods, such as coffee and bananas, simply can't be grown en masse in the US. Just last week, Trump threatened new tariffs on countries that don't comply with his trade demands. China, the recipient of the most aggressive tariffs and the US's third largest trading partner shows no signs of concession. Trump also claimed in an interview with Time to have made 200 deals though, notably, none have been publicly announced. On April 2, Trump announced sweeping tariffs on dozens of countries, including China, Japan and the European Union. One week later as the tariffs were set to go into effect, he paused the majority of the tariffs for 90 days. Conversely, the sweeping tariff on Chinese imports was increased to 145%, Politico reports. In response, China increased tariffs against the US to 125%, bringing the US-China trade war to a boil. Your groceries might get more expensive if Trump's sweeping tariffs come to fruition. On April 9, just hours after Trump announced a 90-day pause, CNET spoke with Russell Hillberry, a professor of agricultural economics at Purdue University, to learn how the "reciprocal" tariffs could affect grocery costs for shoppers in the US. Here's everything you need to know about what is happening right now and what could happen if the additional tariffs go back into effect, according to Hillberry. Read more: Thinking About a Costco Membership? Here's How Much Cheaper Groceries Are "Yes." Hillberry said. "The US gets different products from different areas of the world. The goods are being sold for a certain amount and when they arrive at the port [in the US], there's an extra charge on top of whatever the value is at the port." That means that if items are imported to the US from China right now, when that item gets to the US, there will be an extra 145% charge on top of the original buying price when it arrives at the port. The majority of that extra cost from tariffs is typically passed on to the consumer. If the tariff was 10%, he estimated that roughly only 8% of that extra cost would be passed on to the consumer, which wouldn't make too much of a jaw-dropping difference to consumers especially on lower-cost items, such as groceries. However, the larger the tariff, the larger the price increase. Initially, the tariffs varied. For example, the EU -- where the US gets a lot of its wine and cheese -- is facing a 20% tariff with more potential tariffs on the horizon. If all of the tariffs that Trump announced on April 2 go into effect after the 90-day pause, Americans can expect to see an increase at the grocery store -- and possibly a change in what's available on the shelves. While China is not a large importer of food for the US, many of the countries that were slapped with tariffs on April 9 (before the pause) are. Read more: These Fast Food Chains Hiked Their Prices the Most Last Year The tariffs may cause supply issues that lead to empty shelves and fewer options for shoppers. This is a possibility if the tariffs go back into effect, according to Hillberry. "One thing that isn't appreciated by the president is that countries have other buyers they can sell to," Hillberry said. "So if we decide we don't want them, they'll sell them somewhere else. And it may be that the supply chain can't justify the added costs that go with the tariffs, so some things might not be there." Seafood is one food category that may get significantly more expensive from tariffs. "The things that [the US] doesn't produce at scale, especially fish and shrimp, are coming largely from Asia, India, Vietnam, places like that," Hillberry said. "So those are going to be up 20 to 50% at the port and maybe a little bit less at the grocery store." Most coffee beans are imported, which puts them at risk for a price hike. While most foods will still be available, tariffs will cause a price spike and potential scarcity in key imports. "Coffee and bananas are going to come in, for sure, they'll just be more expensive," Hillberry stressed. "I wouldn't expect these things to vanish but I think you can expect less variety available at the supermarket because of the tariffs. But the main effect will be on prices." Adding guac to a burrito bowl may become even pricier in 2025. Many of the avocados, tomatoes and berries that the US consumes are grown in Mexico, so those products could also see a price hike related to tariffs. Much of the fruit we buy at the supermarket is imported from countries subject to tariffs both now and when the 90-day pause goes back into effect. Canadian whiskey has already been subjected to tariffs. Wine imported from Europe and liquor that comes from Canada, Mexico and parts of Asia are expected to jump in cost as tariffs continue to roll out. It is unclear but before the pause, Hillberry predicted that the Trump administration would abandon the tariffs because they're too painful or that Congress would step in to stop the tariffs, which could happen if they go back into effect. "I really don't think that these are permanent features of the landscape," Hillberry said. "But, you know, once tariffs go up, it does take a while for them to go down again. So I would think that on the food angle, things will be more expensive, not as good, lower quality, and some goods will disappear."

Title: 5 Dividend Stocks That Are Bucking The Bear Market

ByBrett Owens ByBrett Owens, Contributor. Bearish scenario in stock market with bear figure in front of red price drop chart. Let’s talk about consumer staples dividend stocks today. If we’re heading for a slowdown then we need to be picky about our payouts. When the economy slows, discretionary spending is often punted but staples continue to be bought. Today we’ll discuss five dividends between 4.2% and 10.7%. These “must have” products can provide our portfolios with important recession-resistant qualities. Year-to-date staples have been flat and, in this market, that is great. Their sideways action has lapped the over-owned S&P 500 this year: XLP Total Returns Consumer staples stocks tend to have more stable operations that result in more stable share performance in turbulent markets. And they also have predictable profits that allow them to pay out better-than-average dividends. But there are exceptions. Perpetually too-popular staples like Costco (COST) and Walmart (WMT) deliver sub-1% yields. This also drags down the yields of staples-focused funds. This is why we cherry pick our payouts, as always. Let’s get into these five which yield up to 10.7%. Smokers are going to keep smoking, which is why these two tobacco companies have delivered double-digit gains (against the market’s 15% decline!) since Feb. 19: Altria (MO, 6.9% yield) is best-known for its Philip Morris USA segment, which produces Marlboro cigarettes and is by far and away the company’s top revenue driver. But the company is putting increasing focus on its smokeless products, which include Copenhagen and Skoal smokeless tobacco, On! Oral nicotine pouches, NJOY e-vapor products and—through a joint venture with JT Group called Horizon Innovations—heated tobacco products. Altria has been battling volume declines in cigarettes for years, and it has suffered a few self-inflicted wounds, such as its ill-fated stake in Juul Labs. However, higher prices on cigarettes, as well as growth in its smokeless products, have helped keep earnings and its high dividend on the rise, and both are expected to continue their (admittedly slow) growth in 2025. MO Earnings Growth Ever since the market started sliding in February, investors have been snapping up MO shares to get some of that stability. But Altria is getting expensive—yes, a forward P/E of 11 doesn’t scream “overbought,” but it’s noticeably higher than the 8x-9x valuation it has typically carried over the past few years. British American Tobacco (BTI, 7.5% yield) owns a number of well-known cigarette brands, including Camel, American Spirit and Newport. But it too deals in smokeless tobacco, including Grizzly dipping tobacco, Glo heated tobacco, VELO nicotine pouches, and Vuse vapes. In late 2023, BTI announced it would take a massive noncash writedown—which a few months later would become official, at $34.5 billion—on the value of its American cigarette brands. The stock bottomed in late 2024 and has been recovering ever since, including a roughly 10% gain since the February market top. Despite the writedown, BTI’s top and bottom lines have been generally stable if not improving for years. But the company doesn’t expect sustainable growth until at least 2026, when management believes it will get more support from its smokeless portfolio. Fortunately, the company still keeps finding enough change under the couch to improve its dividend, which it has done in 26 of the past 27 years. A 7%-plus yield is stellar. A forward P/E of 9 not so much once we realize that’s at the high end of its multiyear range. Let’s move on to more traditional consumer staples businesses—but not traditional consumer staples names. The sector’s blue chips tend to be overcrowded, which is a recipe for limited yields. Instead, I prefer stocks that live outside of the spotlight but offer good to great levels of income. SpartanNash (SPTN, 4.2% yield) is a company that we’ve previously discussed as a “grocer-plus.” It operates nearly 200 grocery stores in 10 states across numerous brands, including Family Fresh Market, Metcalfe’s Market and Supermercado Nuestra Familia. But its other, larger segment is a wholesale distribution business that services roughly 2,300 independent grocers across the U.S. The company is several years into a turnaround plan that has helped to rejuvenate the top and bottom lines, but the stock’s performance hasn’t matched. As we said back in 2020, “a look at the past 10 years is probably a decent indication of what the next 10 will broadly look like.” SPTN boasts a decent 4%-plus yield that dwarfs most other grocers, it has raised its distribution for 15 consecutive years, and it pays out just less than half its earnings, so the dividend should have more upside. It’s hard to say the same about the stock price. Management did recently express interest in expanding its Hispanic grocery and convenience store presence, but its plans are in their infancy. BGS Foods (BGS, 10.7% yield) is the name behind brands such as Crisco, Cream of Wheat, Ortega and Bear Creek. Its double-digit yield is largely the product of a slumping stock, with shares off by more than 70% over the past few years amid slumping top and bottom lines. Its 10% return since the market top is something of a small miracle considering its continued operational woes. In late February, B&G reported it was booking charges of $320 million related to “intangible trademark assets” on its Green Giant, Victoria, Static Guard and McCann’s brands. BGS also kept its dividend at 19 cents per share, but it’s an open question as to how long B&G can keep it up. The dividend annualizes to 78 cents per share. The pros expect adjusted profits of 68 cents this year and 73 cents in 2026. Something has to give. FEMSA (FMX, 7.0% yield)—the merciful shorthand for Fomento Económico Mexicano, S.A.B. de C.V.—isn’t a familiar name, but it’s awfully interesting. FEMSA operates a huge chain of small-box retail stores, called Oxxo, in Mexico, Colombia, Peru, Chile and Brazil. It uses the same brand for auto service stations in Mexico. It also operates drugstores under several names in Mexico, Chile, Colombia and Ecuador. And it owns nearly half of Coca-Cola FEMSA (KOF), the world’s largest bottler of Coca-Cola (KO) by volume. FEMSA isn’t automatically a great defensive play, then, if our worry is the U.S. economy. We have to keep our eyes on Mexico to determine FMX’s real utility. But there’s a lot to like here. It has a dominant position in Latin America. Top- and bottom-line growth hasn’t been pristine, but it’s better than many other staples names. Estimates are for 26% profit growth this year, then another 12% in 2026. The dividend itself is generous—FEMSA has become increasingly aggressive about returning capital, and it plans on paying four quarterly ordinary dividends as well as four “extraordinary” dividends, coming out to a yield of about 7%. But while FMX has been plenty fruitful, it has also been more volatile than the average staples stock, and it’s also richly priced at 20 times earnings estimates.
