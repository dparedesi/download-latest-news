A group of underdogs surviving within a rigid system by finding clever ways to outsmart it might sound like the plot of a dystopian movie. But despite how fictional that storyline seems, in a world of 8 billion people, a few out-of-the-box free-thinkers exist. Those who want the thrill of rebellion without the guilt of breaking the rules have discovered clever loopholes that let them legally bypass certain situations without actually breaking the law. These ingenious workarounds may sound strange, yet the people who’ve cracked the code and use them repeatedly swear by them, despite how sketchy they might seem. Scroll below to read a few dependable methods Redditors have been using to take advantage of the system that feel completely illegal when you use them, and have been sharing online so others can use them too.

Image source: anon Saying that I will not answer any questions about my medical history unless it is pertinent to the medical information that I *chose* to disclose in order to receive the necessary accommodations. Under HIPAA laws, non government employers are prohibited from asking you for a your medical history, unless you have been diagnosed with any condition or disorder that will 75% prevent you from doing your job. In my case, I have epilepsy, and so I disclosed it and what accommodations I needed. My employer told me that they needed a doctor’s note or letter regarding the diagnosis in order to approve it, and I supplied it. However, when one of the big wigs asked me for one year’s worth of health records, I casually said, “That’s not pertinent to the letter that I sent in, or the diagnosis that required the accommodation letter. You can not ask me for a year’s worth of records, and if you ask again, I will be on the phone with a HIPAA lawyer before you can even blink.”. Image source: KhaosIncarnate5 DoorDash (& other delivery) would mess up my order but if an entire item wasn’t missing, they’d do a tiny partial refund even though I didn’t receive the food I ordered. Forcing me to pay for food I didn’t order. Example: I could order a cheeseburger with onion rings, bacon, BBQ sauce and just receive a plain cheeseburger, and they’d say since it was just missing a few toppings I’d only get a couple bucks back. Basically forcing me to pay full price for an item I didn’t even ask for. Another example: ordering a pizza with pepperoni and jalapenos, having it arrive with only jalapenos. I’d get a $2.50 refund for a missing topping and be stuck with a pizza I didn’t order. Loophole: in the examples above, rather than say my bacon cheeseburger was missing toppings, I’d just say the entire item was missing. I’d tell them I received a burger, but not the burger I ordered, which isn’t lying. My bacon cheeseburger was completely missing and I got someone else’s burger instead. Same with the pizza– it wasn’t just missing a topping, I ordered one pizza and got something completely different. It’s a different way to frame it, but it isn’t dishonest and it’s important because if you got the wrong item, it’s a full refund. If an item was prepared incorrectly, you get hardly anything except food you didn’t ask for.

Image source: GlassCharacter179 TLDR: You can bill a doctor for YOUR time. I have narcolepsy and 18 years ago when we were getting it all sorted out I had to go to the neurologist every month to check in and re-up my prescription (a controlled substance, so they would only do 1 month at a time). Literally every single time I showed up on time and waited 1 hour+ in the waiting room, then they’d put me in the private room where you sit on paper and I’d wait usually another half hour to hour before the Dr. would come in and spend 6 minutes with me. Every time I left the office I paid my copay and every time they made me sign a paper that stated the Dr’s time is valuable and if a patient is more than 5 minutes late for an appointment they’d be billed accordingly (this detail matters for later). I’m pretty patient so I just let it slide for a while. Then one day my insurance changed, I gave them my new insurance info when I paid my copay after my visit. Then a couple months later they sent me a bill for something like $3,000! Turns out they mistakenly tried billing my old insurance for one visit, which obviously didn’t work, so then they tried to get me to pay the absolutely insane amount (for the Dr.’s 6 minutes of time). This was their mistake and I wasn’t going to pay it but they weren’t going to let it go. They told me they would send me to collections. So, I strung them along for several more months to avoid collections and while I was doing that I very carefully and accurately tracked every minute I waited past my scheduled appointment times (remember I went in every 4 weeks). Then I wrote them a letter that was very directly modeled after their “the dr’s time is valuable” letter, it stated that my time is valuable and that starting 10 minutes after my appointment time the Dr is considered late for our appointment and that I would be billing for my time. I stated that I was going to graciously forgive the previous year+ of tardiness but itemized all of my time he had wasted for the last 3-4 months. I came up with a personal hourly rate that made my bill to them about $4,500. They immediately dropped the charges and miraculously I never waited more than about 15 minutes again.

We save those. -it’s unfortunate we can’t store those cuttoffs because they are often all we need. I bring those when we need them. -my boss says that once it hits the dumpster it’s mine. I supply 4 4’ boards from my own house, I’m owed 16 lf. I take home a full 16 footer because I’m swimming in scraps, but sometimes need full boards. -my boss is aware this is dysfunctional.

Title: How CEO Winnie Park is reshaping Five Below into 'Costco for kids'

Every time Dominick publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox! Enter your email By clicking “Sign up”, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Christmas, it is often said, is a time for second chances. So it would seem for Five Below, which is celebrating a transformational year under the leadership of CEO Winnie Park. The stock is up about 85% this year so far — that's well more than the returns of most major retail stocks and AI chip darling Nvidia in the same period. To rewind, last year's holiday season wasn't looking like a very joyful one for the tween- and teen-focused retailer. The Philadelphia-based company was on its way to posting its fourth-straight quarter with negative or flat comparable sales, and that was coming off several prior years of underwhelming performance. While Five Below was managing to grow overall sales through the addition of new stores, existing stores weren't resonating with shoppers. It was also dealing with industry-wide challenges, including shoplifting and the rise of low-priced e-commerce players like Shein and Temu. With Five Below's stock languishing around a third of its 2023 peak, the company tapped Park, then-CEO of Forever 21, to take over as CEO in December 2024 during the holiday rush last year. "When she came in, she was sort of an unknown quantity," Mizuho retail analyst David Bellinger told Business Insider. "It was a question of how is she going to fix this business immediately." While Park may not have been the most widely known CEO on Wall Street, she did come equipped with decades of industry experience, including as CEO of Forever 21 and Paper Source, as well as executive roles at Duty Free Shoppers and Levi's, and a stint with McKinsey's retail team. "Her background allows her to really understand how all of these different aspects of the Five Below business work, because she's drawing on a very rich career," Global Data retail analyst Neil Saunders told Business Insider. "A lot of people come in sometimes as CEOs, and they don't have a tremendous background in retail, or they may have experience in merchandising, but not in supply chains," he added. "Winnie Park was almost like the complete package." Five Below did not respond to a request for comment on this story. Park wasted no time diving in with cofounder and executive chairman Tom Vellios and chief operating officer Ken Bull. The first order of business was refocusing the merchandise on what Five Below's core teen and tween customers want. Bellinger said this was a result of Park's major reset with the sourcing teams, guiding them to find hot items and buy with confidence, while steering away from items, like luggage, that were more adult-focused. "They loaded the store up with 'Lilo and Stitch' merchandise, SpongeBob, Hello Kitty — so when you do have these good, well-known brands, it sort of lifts the whole store," he said. The merchandising effort was also paired with a social media push that the company says has helped attract new shoppers. Park's other major area of focus was simplifying store operations for both employees and customers. With a bit of planning and an incremental investment in labor hours, Five Below says it has improved in-stock rates and customer support at its stores, helping to drive higher sales. "Winnie Park is the type of leader that has a very clear vision for the business," Saunders said. "She doesn't really overcomplicate things." In addition to getting Five Below back to some principles it may have lost touch with in recent years, Park is also showing a willingness to let go of at least one thing that may have been holding the company back: its $5 price point. The last few years of inflation haven't made it easy for retailers with dollar-denominated branding to stick to their original promises. Dollar Tree had to hike its base price to $1.25, and it's tough to run a 99 Cents Only store at a time when the US government is eliminating the penny. President Donald Trump's trade war this year hasn't been much help for import-heavy businesses, either. To manage these cost pressures, the company lumped more merchandise in a catch-all section of the store called Five Beyond, which it had set up years earlier. But that distinction brought unnecessary complexity without meaningful benefit, and the company recently ditched the plan in favor of grouping products by category instead of a price threshold. "It was a very disjointed merchandising set," Bellinger said. "Anything in that price threshold was in the back there." Now, he said, "the way they've assorted the store and spread these items out makes a lot more sense." Bellinger said the move shows that Park understands a critical lesson that successful retailers have had to reckon with in the last few years: value and price are not the same thing. "You could find value in that $30 item. It's all relative," he said. Taken together — exciting products, well-run stores, a focus on great value — Five Below is starting to look in some ways more like a warehouse club than a discount store. "Five Below is essentially the Costco for kids," Bellinger said. "Maybe you want to get some core birthday or party items, and then you wind up expanding your basket and buying all these things you didn't know were there. And then it leads you to your next visit, and you just keep coming back." The success of the past year will raise the expectations for next year's quarterly comparable sales numbers, but Five Below still has several levers it says it can pull to meet the moment. Bellinger said investors are keen to see whether the recent changes at Five Below have led to a structural shift that will drive long-term performance. The average Five Below store generates annual sales of around $2.1 million, but Bellinger said Park's initiatives could significantly boost that number: "Why can't that be a $3 million store now, or even higher?"

By The Knowledge Project Podcast ## Key takeaways - **Doorman Fallacy**: Management consultants replace a doorman costing $X with an automatic door, saving money short-term, but the hotel's reputation crashes because the doorman provided security, taxi hailing, guest recognition, and status—value not captured in 'open the door' metrics. [04:43], [05:29] - **Postman Brand Perception**: Royal Mail found brand affection uncorrelated with service reliability; it depended on liking the postman, who built trust through chats and favors, outweighing metrics like delivery speed. [07:26], [08:15] - **Cold Beer Transaction Utility**: Thaler’s experiment shows people pay more for identical cold beer from a boutique hotel than a shack due to transaction utility—how good the deal feels—independent of the beer's utility. [18:11], [19:30] - **Dyson Call Center Honor**: James Dyson halted efficiency metrics presentation, insisting calls be treated as an honor; staff solved problems helpfully, even free parts next day, building fanatical loyalty despite premium prices. [40:47], [41:20] - **Family Firms Outperform PLCs**: Privately-owned family firms like McCain, Yorkshire Tea, and Dyson dominate advertising effectiveness awards over PLCs, prioritizing long-term customer value over short-term shareholder transactions. [28:28], [32:23] - **Psychopath Detection Test**: Women arrive late on first dates as a test; psychopaths rage while normals say 'traffic was terrible,' revealing character since we evolved to judge trustworthiness over half a million years. [20:43], [22:04] I keep hearing people saying you will say to your AI find me a skiing holiday and it will provide you with a perfect skiing holiday and I keep saying people don't decide like that. When you allow tech bros too much power over decision-m along with their running dog lackey in kind of management consultancy you're optimizing for something which may be very very distant from what your real world customers really care about. >> What makes Dyson so effective at advertising? Actually, it's it's not advertising? Actually, it's it's not advertising. It's marketing and it's advertising. It's marketing and it's customer experience. >> What's the difference between marketing and advertising? >> Advertising is a subordinate part of marketing. And do you think we're marketing. And do you think we're looking for efficiency in the wrong place? >> We usually do. And so, you focus too heavily on cost reduction and too little on value creation. >> What are the rules of good copy? If I asked you to teach me how to write good copy, how would you do that? >> I think a large part of it comes down to So, we first we were talking about this in the elevator. It was nine years ago. She back when podcasting wasn't even a thing. >> We must be able to dig out the original content presumably. Yeah. content presumably. Yeah. >> What was it? It was your podcast number 47 or something, was it? >> Oh, no. I think it was like 16 or something. Really? It was really low. something. Really? It was really low. We'll have to dig out the number, but uh it's been a long time since then. >> Oh, fabulous. Yeah. >> And and podcasting has exploded. I've been following Farum Street devotedly. >> Appreciate that. Um and uh it's always always interesting very very interesting on and I mean the whole question of the decision sciences uh is I think at the moment completely critical and actually by the way it'll be very very interesting with AI because I keep hearing people saying you will say to your AI find me a skiing holiday and it will provide you with the perfect skiing holiday and I keep saying people don't decide like that at the very least you'll have to show them three or four or five skiing holidays from which they choose because we can't really choose in the absence of comparison. It's what do you see what I mean? It's a sort of freakish element of free market capitalism which is we can only like something if we choose it in preference to something else. >> That's interesting. How does that relate to like a travel agency which would do that inherently? Like if you said I'm that inherently? Like if you said I'm going to India to chat GPT and you're like plan it for me versus you go to a travel agency and you're like I'm going to India plan it for me. Well among real estate agents there's apparently a kind of little bit of a trick which is you always in before you show someone the house you want to sell them. You show them a less appropriate house, ideally that's slightly more expensive, say, so that when they see the house that you want to sell them, it's now clearcut because they can say, "Ooh, it's a bit cheaper than the other one and it's got a conservatory." a conservatory." >> There's contrast. >> So there's a kind of decoy effect, a bit like the famous economist experiment with a decoy effect. So, you know, well, you know, one of my interesting questions is, you know, what interface will AI deploy to help us make choices and will it make the mistake that you could very easily make? If you think about it, nobody clicked the I'm feeling lucky button on Google. I think it's still there, isn't it? It's been there for years and they've removed it and found that it slightly reduces the appeal, but the number of people who actually click it, i.e., I'm feeling lucky, take me straight to a single page, is vanishingly small. people want to choose between, you know, effectively above the fold options. And um so, you know, I'm just intrigued because it's very very easy, I think, for people with an economic or tech background to make assumptions about what people are trying to do and how they choose and that we're, you know, utility maximizers and all this kind of thing only really to be completely wrong. Do you think we're looking for wrong. Do you think we're looking for efficiency in the wrong place? We usually do uh in the sense that when you pursue efficiency there are quite a few problems. But when you pursue efficiency generally you start looking at numerical or mechanical factors and of course in the process you disregard psychological factors where the greater gains may be found and so you focus too heavily on cost reduction and too little on value creation. I mean, one of the greatest creation. I mean, one of the greatest forms of efficiency, by the way, is employing a human being who's really, really nice. Now, this is complete really nice. Now, this is complete anathema to people in tech who love to define business processes so as to make them susceptible to automation. You know, person X does this. We will take that function, we will replace it with algorithm Y. And it's a very beguiling message because it usually comes with cost savings attached. You might have heard savings attached. You might have heard of my thing, the Dorman fallacy. Did you >> remind >> I'll remind the viewers and listeners uh which is simply that you know you you have a hotel it's a five-star hotel it has a dormant someone who welcomes incoming guests you know a combination of say McKenzie or Accenture and a tech firm will come in and say your dorman currently costs you $X,000 a year we have defined his or her function as opening the door we will replace said dorman with automatic door opening mechanism and an infrared human detector and we'll save you 30 $40,000 a year and then they walk away. They take the credit for the costsaving and then two years later, you know, the hotel's a catastrophe. The rack rates fallen off a cliff because the dorman was doing multiple things, many of which were human and kind of tacit. Security would be one. You know, there are no vagrants to sleep in the doorway, hailing taxis, dealing with luggage, recognizing regular guests, providing status to the hotel. There are loads and loads of value creation components to that dorman which aren't captured in the open the door definition. >> Is that an example of where the costs are really visible, but the benefits are >> correct? Yeah. So you it's very very >> correct? Yeah. So you it's very very easy management consulting firms uh if you if you're in a business and and some management consultants come in go to the management and say are they on a gain share agreement. A gain share agreement share agreement. A gain share agreement is a management consulting scam where you claim uh a certain percentage of the cost savings you identify in year one. Now as Roger L. Martin, your fellow Canadian and my own personal Svengali says, "Any idiot can cut costs." Okay. What takes real skill is cutting cost in a way that doesn't destroy value. One of the things that I don't think is understood by tech nerds and if I'm being really cruel, you know, males in general in in many cases is the extent to which in evaluating any business or experience, the human component of it, the face-to-face component does really really heavy lifting. And I've got a lovely story to illustrate this which I think is fantastic. It's the absolute perfect example of misalignment of optimization through quantification bias. So wonderful man Alex Bachelor bias. So wonderful man Alex Bachelor used to be the marketing director of Royal Mail, but you know similar to what you have with Canada Post, right? USPS. >> Mhm. Sorry, not US. Yes, just USPS. And they couldn't make any sense of the fact that the brand perception of Royal Mail bore no relation to service levels. So there would be districts and areas where you know every single firstass letter arrived early the following day extraordinarily reliable levels of service and royal mail wasn't particularly held in affection or esteem. There were other areas where the esteem. There were other areas where the service was frankly a bit ropey and people seemed to love it. Now, this obviously upset them because they thought that all the billions or certainly hundreds of millions they'd invested in service quality improvement should translate into customer satisfaction and therefore, you know, some sort of brand voltage. And someone had a theory and they said, I think something else is going on. And the theory which was put to the test and proved absolutely right was that the major determinant of whether you liked royal male or not was whether you liked your postman or posty technically to be used the genderneutral term. >> So people who had a rather unreliable service but the postman did the odd favor for them left things in the porch had a chat with them. Okay, those people thought it was a brilliant organization regardless of the actual metrics that were being pursued. And I think that's very true in uh any service organization. You know, you may there's organization. You know, you may there's an electricity company, a gas company, a water company, a utility. You may interact with them online 95% of the time, but the one or two occasions where you interact by telephone or face to face disproportionately affect your your perception of the organization. And I've argued for quite a time if I were being completely honest, I've worked in advertising for 36 years. And if I were a wholly honest person, uh, without, you know, fear of annoying my colleagues, probably 50% of the time, I would advise to a client, take 10 to 20% of your marketing budget and spend it on upgrading the call center. Pay the people too much. Get the best practitioners. I think it's perfectly practitioners. I think it's perfectly legitimate. In some organizations, there legitimate. In some organizations, there should be the very best call center people should be on six figures because it makes if you're good and nice, that's how much difference it makes. In other words, it more or less makes. In other words, it more or less drowns out all your other stuff, all the other noise. If every time you have a other noise. If every time you have a personal experience, you have a good experience, then broadly speaking in the human brain, uh that's a good organization which I can trust. And when you think about it, I suddenly realize why this probably is. We don't really have much evolved experience in evaluating postal efficiency, do we? Okay, we have quart of a million half a million years of evolved experience in deciding who to like and trust because for most of our evolutionary, you know, existence, that was one of the most fi five most important questions to get right. You know, do I trust this person? right. You know, do I trust this person? You know, will they attack me? Are they an ally? Are they a foe? Uh if I pay them money, will they deliver? And so consequently, I think what we do in our brains is we use our human judgment as a proxy. >> Now, a story to back up that, you probably remember this, okay? It's in my book, Alchemy, which is imagine you're turning up to buy a secondhand car and you turn up at the house, nondescript house, and the car is parked outside the house and you have a look at the car and you judge the, you know, whether the pedals are worn and the condition of the body work, and you have a look around the car. and you decide you're interested in paying, let's say, $5,000 for this car. So, you go and ring on the doorbell of the vendor and the door is answered in one situation by, for example, a female vicar. Okay? Could be Catholic. Well, they can't be Catholic, but you know, Episcopalian, doesn't really matter. Okay? Female vicar. And it's a tidy clean house. At that point, you probably upweight what you're prepared to pay by 20% or so. In in a parallel universe, the door so. In in a parallel universe, the door is answered by a guy in his underpants. In other words, someone with no shame. >> In that instance, you devalue the car, I suspect, by about $1,000 or more. In fact, you may not even buy it at all. And what we're doing here is we're effectively saying, what I'm going to do is a standin for the question, do I buy the car, which I don't have the technical knowledge to answer. I'm going to ask a supplementary heruristic question which is do I trust the person who's selling the car to me? >> And it's an interesting question. You my mother didn't know anything about cars, knew a lot about people. I think she would very reliably go around buying cars just through her assessment of the seller. And similarly, I think she might do better than someone with an engineering qualification who ignored who the seller was and their personality and character. Now, as a bit of evidence of this, I discovered because I've been investigating this, uh, various real estate agents have said to me that every estate agent does their utmost to make sure that until things are signed and sealed, the vendor never meets the buyer and vice versa. And the reason for that is if one of them doesn't like the other, they won't buy or sell. Now, when you think about it, that's completely unless the person's moving next door. Obviously, if you're buying a next door. Obviously, if you're buying a house from someone who's planning to move next door and they turn out to be a psycho, that's relevant information. But it seems to be the case that if you meet the the vendor and you basically don't trust them or think they're a bit shifty, it doesn't matter what the price is. It doesn't matter the condition of is. It doesn't matter the condition of the house. Suddenly, you revise your the house. Suddenly, you revise your valuation of the house downwards if you don't like the person selling it to you. And so that's one of the reasons why apparently uh real estate agents will leave any kind of contact between the two uh until after at least a survey has been done and enough commitments taken place. I once by the way I once didn't place. I once by the way I once didn't buy a house basically because the guy was being an about the fridge. Now the fridge was only worth uh you know I think 0.2% 2% uh of the value of the house or 0.02% of the value of the house. I can't quite remember. But because he was being a remember. But because he was being a dick about the fridge, I no longer trusted him about the house. >> Yeah. >> Weirdly, it turned out my instinct was right because then a friend of ours went to buy the same house. They got some separate land registry search done and found out that a chunk of the garden actually belonged to Network Rail, not to the house. It effectively filed a large part of the garden. So does that mean I just want to garden. So does that mean I just want to go back to the the real estate thing for a second. Does that mean a second. Does that mean pretty or attractive real estate agents would be more successful than >> It's a really interesting question which is I think we you know I think we ought to study these things much more because the assumption of an economist is that you need to disintermediate >> you don't need estate agents we just go on willow Zillow sorry or right move in the UK or whatever it is what's the Canadian equivalent >> I don't even know >> cababins.com or whatever okay.com Yeah, we go. Exactly. You go on one of those things. You choose the house you those things. You choose the house you want. You look at it. You then look at want. You look at it. You then look at the house, get a survey done, buy the house. We assume that there is, you house. We assume that there is, you know, this is a purely transactional exchange. Maybe in a rational world, that's exactly what it would be. >> But for one thing, actually, someone who's invested 15 years in doing up a house probably cares about what the person buying it is going to do to the house. So, my parents-in-law, for example, are fanatical gardeners. Uh, don't get into fanatical gardeners. Uh, don't get into this. Seriously, get into something like this. Seriously, get into something like crack. >> We have no worry that I'm going to >> No worry you're going to become an enthusiastic. >> Can barely keep a plant alive. >> Good, good, good. Okay. Um, but I guarantee if you went and looked around their house and placed an offer while being an expert in botany and generally quoting people like Gertude Jel and, you know, prominent garden designers and Sissinghurst and Da uh you could you could buy their house for 200,000 less than if you turned up and said, "Brilliant, we can knock down that tree and put in a helipad." Yeah. >> You know, I think if you said, "We can knock down that tree and put in a carting track." Right. I don't think carting track." Right. I don't think they'd sell it to you at any price. >> If you're a founder, you know naming your startup takes forever.

Richard Thaylor did I think his most interesting work of all is actually on the concept of transaction utility which you may remember do you remember this >> a little bit >> yeah it's in I think it's in nudge and the famous thought experiment is this which I find fascinating and I think it's a really insightful thought experiment so the idea is you and your best friend are lying on a beach somewhere and it's hot and you're very thirsty and about quarter of a mile down the beach there's a place that sells ice cold beer And your friend says to you, and he asks people to imagine this, your friend says to you, "I'm off to blank to buy a beer. Tell me what the maximum amount you're happy to pay for a beer is. And if the price they quote falls is. And if the price they quote falls below that threshold, okay, I will buy the beer. And if not, I won't." And he the beer. And if not, I won't." And he asked people to imagine what the threshold would be of what they'd pay for a beer on a hot day when they were parched on a beach for a cold beer. the beer is going to be consumed back where they're sitting. So the ambiance or you know the the clientele of the establishment selling the beer is irrelevant because you're not going to consume it there. And the interesting thing is in one situation he says there is a boutique hotel selling chilled beer >> and in the other situation he says there's a shack selling cold beer >> and your price changes >> and your your your readiness to pay changes partly in accordance to what you imagine to be the overheads of the establishment selling the good. Even though the >> even though the the utility of the beer as distinct from the how good the transaction feels >> the actual utility of the cold beer is identical in both cases. I think that's a I think that's Richard Thaylor and I think it's extraordinarily interesting because I think we can make you car car salesmen will know this you know make the transaction feel good make them feel good when they drive out of the place that was uh segini right you you know people are more likely to buy from you if they like you they're more likely to uh like you if they trust you and you have something in common with them and and you can use all of these things to manipulate people unfortunately It's not manipulation. Be careful on that because No, no, no. We got to be really care. I think we got to be really careful here. One, one thing might be that a genuine cold-blooded psychopath would intentionally might find it difficult. This is a Jeffrey Miller theory that if you're on a first date, there's an element where apparently, it's a long time. I've been married for 30 something time. I've been married for 30 something years, but women on a first date will turn up a bit late or do something a little bit annoying. And Miller's theory is that it's a psychopath detection test. So that if you >> Interesting. So, you know, one of the >> Interesting. So, you know, one of the worst things that can happen to women is to get into a relationship with someone who's, you know, psychopathic because you end up with an empty bank account and a, you know, and, you know, your sister's pregnant by her everything go, you know, everything goes hopelessly wrong. Someone who's written very wrong. Someone who's written very interestingly about this, by the way, is fabulous woman who writes about education and absolutely brilliant. I I'll remember her name in a second, but she's written quite about this having a psychopath in the family. Likewise, Kevin Dutton um has also written about this about his own father. There are certain things which you can do which make it very likely that psychopaths will out themselves. So the perfect test might be you bribe the waiter to tip soup on them. >> Oh, interesting. >> And they'll lose it. >> Or you turn up late and someone like assuming you're not a psycho because you're Canadian. So you know that's you're Canadian. So you know that's probably >> by default we're not >> relatively low. We're too polite. >> You're too polite. Exactly. Yes. It'd be too tiring to be a psychopath in Canada, wouldn't it? >> Soup on me. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have been sitting here. >> It's I shouldn't have been here. My fault. I got in the way of your soup. Uh the psychopath will lose lose his rag. >> Um uh and can't control this. And likewise, if you turn up late, there's a chance they'll go, "Look, I've been sitting on my own like an idiot for 15 minutes." Whereas you and I would go, minutes." Whereas you and I would go, "Oh, I know. I only just got here myself. The traffic's terrible." myself. The traffic's terrible." >> Yeah. We don't fully know, you see, the value of what is going on in using a personal quality as a proxy for a decision which is simply too complicated to legalize or to reduce to numbers. Also, it is I'll completely agree in economic terms, it's suboptimal, but if it leads to downside variance reduction, which is what we're really trying to do. We're not trying to optimize. We're trying to reduce the optimize. We're trying to reduce the risk of downsize. Yeah. Downside variance, you know, and that's true in all sorts of things, investment strategy, etc. You know, the barbell approach, you know, first of all, make sure you don't don't do anything disastrous. Then after that, try and get disastrous. Then after that, try and get lucky. >> You you say it like it's a conscious thing, but I think it's an unconscious because because if it is conscious, it's probably a reverse signal that you're actually a bit uh offkilter. if you're consciously doing that. >> In fairness, if if you study social science matters, you've probably but I agree with you that the I mean my wife occasionally gets a bit annoyed with me because I'll get you know I will literally apply TALB logic to decisions. Just to give an example, I always argue that over 36 years holidays where I've rented a car are better than holidays where I haven't. And my argument is you have more optionality. See? >> Oh, interesting. So if you've rented a car and you find the hotel's a bit meh or the hotel's not in a great area, you can just get in the car and go and find a beach somewhere else and go there every day. You know, in other words, you every day. You know, in other words, you know, so I deploy occasionally we'll deploy these kind of taleb lines and I, you know, I'll also say let's fly from so and so because you know it's the satisfices. You you're the one who I remember this you said you should always fly from the smallest airport that's convenient for you. Is that it? you. Is that it? >> Oh, I'm I'm a big small airport thing person. Okay. person. Okay. >> Yeah. Yeah. Actually, it's it's kind of interesting because airports are schizophrenic in a way because the clientele of an airport is roughly speaking a 50/50 mix between people who fly a hell of a lot and just want to get through the damn thing as quickly as they can. And people who only fly once a they can. And people who only fly once a year who regard the trip to the airport as part of the holiday and they love going through a shopping center and looking at Hermes outlets or whatever. And so airports are effectively catering for two totally disperate groups of traveler. >> And you can separate these people in the security line effectively. >> You can absolutely you can separate them. And that's why you know um in a them. And that's why you know um in a weird kind of way I think you notice sometimes that the queue for the priority lane in security is longer than the queue for the amateur lane. But frequent business travelers will still join the priority lane on the assumption that the people in front of them are more competent. I mean there's a George more competent. I mean there's a George Clooney up in the air gag about that right and so it is very interesting because is it is it irrational if it's a very reliable mechanism so all right one example would be I don't think it I don't think it works very well nowadays because there are enough posh spivs around but in the you know in the 19th century if you were a posh and respected real estate agent you had a lot of reputational skin in the game in the local community both commercially in people, you know, so you were highly vulnerable to reputational damage both commercially and also socially >> because you know a small town or a you know would have been to a large extent a prestige economy >> and therefore you know dealing with the posh local estate agent rather than some guy who claims to be cheap is not irrational. you know then that you know irrational. you know then that you know the commission may be higher whatever it may be but in terms of reputational skin in the game as insurance against being you know treated appallingly but and you know I think there's a kind of weird thing going on which is that uh you know the the job of the real estate agent is to some extent to be the person who stays behind in the place where the house is sold to suffer the reputational consequences of you know of anything outrageous because the vendor of the house isn't really reputationally vulnerable if they're moving 300 miles away. >> Mhm. >> And so, you know, some of the role of these intermediaries is just highly complicated. >> But when I say that, you know, we fundamentally seem to attach very very high waiting to, for example, a call center experience versus website design. I'm not suggesting for a second website design isn't really important. It's it's almost like there's some experiences that are sort of additive or subtractive and then there's some that are multiplicative >> like you can multiply by zero or you can multiply by 10 like a difference in that one particular factor. There's a there's a really interesting organization I can't remember what they're called online they call this a brand quake. >> A brand quake is where you do something. It could be resolving a problem really well. That would be a very good well. That would be a very good opportunity for a brandquake. The person has a problem. you put quite a lot of effort and intelligence into solving it very effectively for them. Um and then you ring them back to check that the problem has indeed been solved. Now that would be an example of something I'll give you the per okay I'll give you the perfect story of this. My father uh who is you know half Scottish and um without stereotyping anybody was quite parimonious with what he bought generally. I mean I'm not I'm not saying generally. I mean I'm not I'm not saying it's genetic by the way. just culturally he was descended from long lines of Highland Scots who didn't get where they were today by you know splashing out and he had a I think three um when he died he had three or four Dyson devices which he'd bought from new in his home he had one on each floor to save from carrying them upstairs. Now these are by any them upstairs. Now these are by any objective measure pretty expensive vacuum cleaners. Mhm. vacuum cleaners. Mhm. >> One of the reasons he was so fanatically loyal was that Dyson, now interestingly, I'm going to make a point here, which is a privately owned company. >> Mhm. >> And that and do not do not underestimate the importance of this. PLC's or um uh or or companies on the NASDAQ or the New York Stock Exchange are incentivized to behave like psychopaths because they're optimized around short-term transactional value, not long-term relationship building. I think maybe the the generalization is that like if they're private companies led by a founder, then they're not run by the finance department. It's so interesting. I think about this a lot where you you have these short-term optimization and long-term effectiveness are two completely different. >> Short-term money off versus long-term value on. >> Yeah. Yeah. And so you can there's always somebody making more money than you, but you maybe they're cutting corners, maybe they're doing things that are unsustainable. And like you said, are unsustainable. And like you said, you can always save money in the short term, but do you damage your brand in life? >> By the way, my theory is the primary reason for the success of these private companies. It the secondary reason is companies. It the secondary reason is they look after their consumers better because they're effectively uh unwittingly their practitioners in the customer value movement, not the shareholder value movement. Well, Buffett had this saying where his directive, his letter I guess to all of his CEOs after he acquired the company was the only expectation I have for you is to treat this company as if you and your family have 100% of your money in it for 100 years and you can't take it out. >> Exactly that. Yeah. >> And and I think that that approach enables even in a public company that enables people to take long-term do the thing that's optimal. actually they do something they do something they look after their customers and there is an interesting exception to this probably which is for example Costco which and actually enterprise rental car is familyowned isn't it enterprise is familyowned >> in the and I've told everybody this in the IPA advertising effectiveness awards in the UK my argument is that with the exception of PNG Dagio unilver marketing le companies I don't think that plc's what do you call them in you know publicly traded I don't think they can actually do marketing very well >> because the requirement for short-term self-justification and numbers effectively overrides the real purpose of marketing which is investment in long-term customer value. >> I think this is why generalizing a little bit but this is why founders outperform even when they lead public corporations. They have the same corporations. They have the same pressures, the same analysts, the same but they also are considering posterity aren't they? What is my legacy? I mean, aren't they? What is my legacy? I mean, it's interesting actually the German car industry, although their public companies are sort of familyrun. Aldi famously, which owns Trader Joe's, is basically owned by actually two German families. They had a huge feud, but some families. They had a huge feud, but some things going on there. One of the things they do is they look after their staff better. And I think when you look after better. And I think when you look after your staff better, the customer notices. >> Well, this is part of the Costco thing. So, I mean, >> Costco. Exactly. But that comes from the >> Costco. Exactly. But that comes from the Saul Price line of thinking which when he started FedMart he sort of outlined the obligation of our business is we have a fidiciary relationship with a customer. Yeah. customer. Yeah. >> And Jim Sagal who founded Costco was a student of Saul Price and later on they would merge the companies. >> Of course they did, didn't they? Yes, you're absolutely right. Yeah. >> Yeah. And I I think that's interesting right where you treat your employees better. Uh nice story from Dyson which better. Uh nice story from Dyson which is familyowned. In fact, I think is familyowned. In fact, I think familyrun companies, this would include people like um SC Johnson. I think they should wear a badge. Do you see what I mean? Just as you have a kite mark on mean? Just as you have a kite mark on British >> Well, Lob Laws is familyowned, isn't it? For example, in Canada, family, >> family control McCain family control. Mhm. >> So what I was saying about the advertising effectiveness awards, four out of the five gold winners, it's only every two years this award and it's very very rigorously judged. Four out of the five winners, namely McCain, your >> Canadian uh heroes. Um McCain, Yorkshire Tea, Specs Savers, and Laithweights, a wine company. Four out of the five wine company. Four out of the five winners, the fifth one was Guinness, which is sort of a family company in a sense, although it's owned by a Dio. And so my point is that I, you know, we should actually have a kite mark that allows consumers to prefer to buy from companies which aren't listed on some stock exchange somewhere and hence aren't controlled by the finance function because they're more trustworthy. >> That's an interesting I don't know if I agree with that, but u it's interesting to think. >> Well, is Rogers what's is Rogers still family controlled? I mean, Canada's family controlled? I mean, Canada's absolutely packed full of Canadian tier. What about that? Increasingly you get family controlled but not economically controlled. So you have like a dual controlled. So you have like a dual class. >> So the western family would control lob laws to some extent even though they're not majority shareholder. >> Well I think if you if you have a corporation that's hundreds of billions and you control 10 or 15% of it. You effectively have control over the company. >> Of course. Yeah. Ford Motor Company falls into that definition. I think the f you know the family or some there's a particular class of shares. >> A lot of dual class coming. But hold on, I want to go back to Dyson for a sec. What makes Dyson so effective at advertising? >> Actually, it's it's not advertising, it's marketing and it's customer experience. >> What's the difference between marketing and advertising? >> Advertising is a subordinate part of marketing. And uh in many cases, even marketing. And uh in many cases, even though I've worked in advertising for 36 years, I I I want to think of myself probably unsuccessfully, but I still aspire to be a marketer, okay? not an advertising person because advertising is a useful toolkit available to the marketer and by the way generally is pretty effective but Peter Ducker the purpose of business is to find and keep a customer profitably uh that's the purpose of marketing it's to you know to you know to either create or find uh customers with whom over time you can engage in mutually advantageous relationships to mutual profit that's it >> so what makes Dyson so good at marketing? >> Well, the story I heard from someone who worked at Dyson for 12 years is that he was sitting in a presentation, James Dyson presiding and they were presenting the call center sort of efficiency statistics. By the way, I'm absolutely fanatical about call centers because I'm terrified that in an AI age, people will try and effectively automate them. Uh I think what you should do instead is make them slightly smaller but a lot better >> because I don't think you can substitute for the human in cases of unusual problems, special circumstances, empathy generally. Don't get me wrong, I think generally. Don't get me wrong, I think you can get AI empathy. I'm not suggesting that AI is going to be completely unempathic, but at some point it's rather like the equivalent of I want to speak to the manager. There will be situations where you want to speak to a person who can understand your specific situation and has the power to intervene to override the normal rules and regulations to solve your problem because it is common sensical to do so. Even if you know our what service level agreement doesn't normally allow us to send out a replacement part. In this case, since your part is faulty, >> somebody who has the power to do the right thing Got it. Exactly. And I think you know I Got it. Exactly. And I think you know I I think that will ultimately you'll have to have the human as the last port of call on that. Also your call center is the only way you can find out the problems that people can't solve anywhere else. Do you see what I mean? anywhere else. Do you see what I mean? So there was a very smart person I met at Microsoft who when they uh when they took over some fairly niche Microsoft product they put the call center in the middle of the development team. I mean, I would argue that the call center of British Airways should be on the same floor as the boardroom because it's where you find out where you're going wrong with your existing customers who are the most important people. You know, people talk a lot about product market fit, sales tactics, or pricing strategy. But the truth is, pricing strategy. But the truth is, success in selling often comes down to something much simpler, the system behind the sale. That's why I use and love Shopay because nobody does selling better than Shopify.

So often the businesses are run by the map which is like the spreadsheets, the volumes, the wait times, the whatever, but the territory is the customer calling in and the problem. >> That's cool, isn't it? >> The map is not the territory. >> Yeah. That they're experiencing. And so if you're not touching reality, you can get distorted by the map. But I want to go back. You've said by the way exactly go back. You've said by the way exactly the same thing Dan Davis did which is one huge advantage of being a customer value company not a shareholder value company is that customers live in the real world and therefore you are actually rooted in reality whereas shareholders by the way not share owners but the shareholders are principally interested in justifying their own existence to their investors and therefore they're dealing with a highly artificial construct in terms of defining the value of a customer But I think what's best for the shareholders is what's best for the customer. It's just the timeline mismatch that people have. So if your timeline for well it's have. So if your timeline for well it's incoherent by the way the shareholder value movement is totally incoherent because over what time frame which shareholder is what are you optimizing for? It's a completely incoherent for? It's a completely incoherent nonsense which is very very friendly to stock market analysts who want a ready supply of quarterly data so they can their way out of things. How valuable it is to people with pensions is a completely separate matter because one of the things it does is it prevents companies from innovating effectively and it prevents them from investing properly in customer relationships. >> Okay. Come back to Dyson. You were telling me this story. Somebody had worked there for 12 years. >> So they were going blah blah blah average call time blah blah blah average wait time and it was the standard kind of call center metrics about effectively how quickly can we get these people off the phone. I mean it's a bit more the phone. I mean it's a bit more sophisticated than that. You know, I'm sure there's some measure of satisfaction, but it was kind of evaluating the call center on an operational efficiency standpoint. And Dyson basically said, "Stop right now. You've got this all wrong. The way we should look at this is we should treat it as an honor if one of our customers chooses to get in touch with us, and we should therefore respond to them accordingly, as if we're flattered by the contact, not as if we're bothered by the interruption or words to that effect. I'm I'm putting words in his effect. I'm I'm putting words in his mouth, but this is roughly speaking what the person said happened in the meeting. >> That makes a lot of sense. I mean, >> and by the way, that's why my father had four Dyson. Stingy man though he was. I four Dyson. Stingy man though he was. I hope he won't mind me saying this, my late father. But every time he rang them late father. But every time he rang them up, which might have been only once every year. >> Yeah. >> They did something astonishing and they were really, really helpful and they solved the problem and the part arrived the next day. Sometimes they didn't even charge for the replacement part and therefore he completely trusted those people and therefore was willing to pay an enormous premium really over other vacuum cleaners which might have had the same notional you know effectiveness precisely because of that trust. There's so much opportunity here, right? If you think of you competing in a world where we're moving to AIdriven call centers, uh if I took the exact opposite approach, which is by the way, you should do both. >> A really, really good service organization allows for very streamlined efficient service for people who know exactly what they want and extremely emp empathetic service for people who are undecided, uncertain or find themselves in an unusual situation. And so you need to do both. And that's that's where I think the tech bros have got it all wrong because they see the opportunity of tech as being a one-way street towards ever greater efficiency, streamlining. And let's face it, tech streamlining. And let's face it, tech bros are not neurotypical in terms of what they want from things. When you allow tech bros too much power over decision-making along with their running dog lackey in kind of management consultancy, you're optimizing for something which may be very very distant from what your real world customers really care about. >> You're using tech crows as like a >> No, no, no, no. It's perfectly reasonable to say that the people who work in this field and not representative of the whole human population. That's a reasonable population. That's a reasonable assertion. >> What is it you're representing when you say tech bro though? Um, anybody in a tech industry, just as anybody in advertising, myself included, is overweighted towards a belief in the ability of advertising to solve all problems. And I will truly admit that I am guilty as charged. Um, however, ad people don't get that much opportunity to convince other people of the rightness of their argument. What has happened is that in marketing for example the tech companies the consulting firms that sell stacks and I owe a lot of this to a guy called Adel Bori very interesting self-taught Libyan marketing writer former boxer Annel Bori and I coined the phrase technopplasmosis by analogy with toxopplasmosis which is tech people and consultants have taken over the finance department >> so that the marketing metrics the finance department has faith in and demands from marketing are not those metrics which are most conducive to building brand and customer value over time. They're the metrics which are most time. They're the metrics which are most conducive to selling tech solutions to the companies. >> What are the metrics that are most >> well it's all about short-term transactional uh bottom of the funnel um clickth through you know how can you shovel money to meta in a slightly more efficient way. It's not about long-term efficient way. It's not about long-term value creation at all right now. Now, don't get me wrong. All that bottom of the funnel short-term transactional stuff is very important to get right. I'm not I'm not disparaging it, but it's only a third of the game, >> right? >> And they're not interested in the other two/irds of the game because they don't make money if someone spends money on their call center or, you know, upgrades their call center staff or allows the call center staff to call out. >> It's sort of like cyber security. It's seen as a cost. It's a cost. >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, Bonnie Blue would do really well in this because she's all about the numbers, not about the quality of the relationship. You know, funny enough, she did work in NHS finance procurement. Ironically, or no, finance recruitment actually. She recruited people for N for National Health Service finance. So, her approach to sex is merely an extrapolation of what she learned, I think, recruiting finance people for the National Health Service. All all about the quantity, not Service. All all about the quantity, not about the value creation, the the relationship. I like this quantification relationship. I like this quantification bias thinking I mean Buffett okay you're quite rightly your hero um is he was obsessed with the quality of the management of companies with whom he invested wasn't he >> well I mean I'm obsessed with personal factors I've read a lot in I think I'm going to give a nuanced answer here I don't know the answer so I'll preface that with that I did read a lot about what he used to do in the 60s and he used to hire like private investigators And what he was trying to determine, I don't think it was anything about the person other than does what they say line up with who they are. >> And if the answer's yes, I can deal with that because I know what to expect. And if the answer's no, if they're they can't go to work and, you know, claim to be a penny pincher, because if they go to work and say they're going to cut costs, but they're driving around with a Ferrari or whatever, like this is a thing that it doesn't line up. And so I I feel like he was always just trying to assess the predictability of people if that makes sense. >> In other words, by looking at their consistency >> consistency did the management >> do what they said they were going to do. the balance sheet changes over you know like he was a very he had a different emphasis on things than people I think realize and I think with a lot of his investments I mean my personal take is he was looking for predictability and it wasn't about massive disruption it was never about things being turned around he got out of that in the late60s with diversified refilling was the last real turnaround situation they sort of got themselves into they exited quickly and when They got burned. Did they quite Well, they didn't really get burned, but I was talking to Munger about this over dinner one day and he's like, "We just realized that we made a mistake. Uh, we were never going to make a lot of money in this business and it was highly competitive and we had no edge and so they got out as quickly as they could." Uh, and I think that the predictability of what he buys, at least his long-term holdings, like if you look at that, I think it's really interesting because it's like you can kind of see it. The railroad, people are going to be using the railroad in 50 years. That's a great example. So, it will be unbelievably example. So, it will be unbelievably difficult to build a competing one, >> but you can also you can leverage it if it's predictable. And leverage is is it's predictable. And leverage is is this interesting thing where he says they don't do a lot. And they don't when you look at the whole company, but on the railroad, for instance, they'll a decent amount of debt in the railroad because they know what the earnings it's very predictable the same as the energy where they're putting a lot of capital they put a lot of debt in and I talked to this guy in um Nova Scotia John Bragg and he sort of did the same thing and so he c he created Oxford frozen foods he's this incredible story he's this billionaire from this small town of 1100 people he started >> I've been to Nova Scotia what's it called Oxford Nova >> it's called Oxford Nova Scotia and started not one, not two, but three multi-billion dollar companies from this small town of,00 people. >> Is he still there? >> He's still there. Yeah. They're like that. >> Such a great guy, too. And it was fascinating to talk to him because he basically was like, "Look, you know, he owns North America's largest private telecommunications company." And he telecommunications company." And he said, "I wasn't afraid of debt at all." No. >> And we levered up massively. We went all in multiple times acquiring more assets, acquiring, >> but if there's something more volatile, he gets very nervous about the debt. >> So, he wouldn't do it if there was volatility. But he also had this thing volatility. But he also had this thing where it was so counterintuitive to what you hear on Wall Street, which is is like, I don't mind paying more, you know? I don't mind paying the most. Uh, know? I don't mind paying the most. Uh, and I was like, really, that surprises me. And he's like, well, a lot of these me. And he's like, well, a lot of these things only come up once. I don't get another shot at it. And if I'm a private company, I don't have public company shareholders, uh, and it takes me, you know, 5 years versus 3 years to get my money back out of the deal, why do I care? I'm never going to be offered this care? I'm never going to be offered this again, and they're not going to build another one. >> No. >> So, when it comes to fiber optic in the ground, he's like, it's getting harder and harder to do. >> What is this company, the Canadian company in telecoms? >> Uh, it's East Link Cable Communications. >> I've heard that. Yeah. And so, but they not only do they deliver cable to a large portion of Canada, but they own a lot of infrastructure that people aren't aware of. And he's like, well, what aware of. And he's like, well, what difference does it make? And I've been chewing on that nugget ever since. And you know, you can apply this from a marketing perspective as well, right? If you if you have a client or go back to real estate for a sec. I have a client who's looking at a lakehouse or a cabin or a cottage or whatever you call them in in the UK or in the United States and you get a property and you say my budget is I don't know say 500,000 and you find a property that's seven and is it worth splurging on the $700,000 property or whatever it is and the answer is is this like a once in a generation property that I'm never going to have the shot at again and if you can frame frame things >> is also much more likely to be scarce >> the rarer you get generally >> and then overpaying you make overpaying seem rational and in a way it kind of is rational where it's like well this is only going to come up once so like I I have a friend actually going through this now they're looking at buying a family cottage and I'm like how do you think about these things he's like I saw this one it was perfect but it was a little more money than I brought this up having a cottage on a lake on which yours is the only cottage is the kind of gold standard for Canadian property. >> That would be the dream. Have a lot of lakes. Yes. But I'd always heard that as lakes. Yes. But I'd always heard that as a kind of >> but it's sort of like what what do you want? If you want a second property, you want? If you want a second property, you want proximity so it's easy to get to. You want privacy. Uh so there's not a lot of things around it. And these things just don't come up very often as many lakes as we have. I mean the the prime properties come up maybe once every five or six years per lake. And >> and as Kaden said, in the long term, we're all dead. >> And we're all dead. So anyway, an interesting aside here, but when we sat down, we were talking about high trust versus low trust societies and introducing friction. Yeah. I'm introducing friction. Yeah. I'm wondering, spend a beat on that for a second. >> Well, I met um someone you must interview, by the way, called Philip K. Howard, who's written various books called Life Without Lawyers. He's just written a book which is coming out right now called um uh I think it's uh can do which is restoring the spirit of American can do and he argues that a large part of economic decline and social malaise has come from the overintrusion of law and regulation into practices which should properly be left to subjective human judgment. that we've created a culture where people are so afraid of making a subjective decision that they fall back on often totally inappropriate rules and regulations. And there are a whole bunch of people who are employed not always by the government just as much by the private sector who are much more interested in adherence to uh approved procedure than they are in quality of outcome. >> Because you can't get fired for >> you can't get fired for following the rules. >> You can't get me in trouble. Well, you told me to follow this proced and common sense would be to opt out at some point in certain situations and use your brain and judgment and uh but if I do that if I have if I do very little parapet there's no upside uh and there's considerable uh reputational risk and and career risk >> from doing something slightly perverse and different. But there are a whole and different. But there are a whole bunch of arguments. First of all, an awful lot of quality human decision-making of necessity has to be tacit and instinctive, not regulatory. There are various people I think it might be Michael Palani who says most of life is like a kaleidoscope. We never completely encounter the same situation twice. Mhm. twice. Mhm. >> And therefore regulating for the universal when in fact the great evolutionary gift of the human brain is adapting to context is inherently lawyers love it of course because they make money out of this. You know, arguably uh the legal system, particularly in the United States, has strayed into all kinds of areas which were once settled by two humans amicably discussing something and possibly finding a creative resolution to to the trade-off that's replaced by effectively we will take this to a legal decision and that starts to infect um particularly because there's no tor law reform in the US and that's partly Because I was told yesterday trial lawyers are among the largest donors to the Democratic Party because they resist any kind of tort law reform. M >> this has led to things that should be solved through our evolved human talent for conflict resolution being solved through totally inappropriate application of of uh legal structures to a situation which is uh in many cases not really adequately captured by law or where a legal decision is made which makes perfect sense within one setting but which sets a precedent which leads to ludicrous second order consequences. Yeah. So for example, if you accept the fact that a I think has happened in one of uh Philip K. Howard's cases, someone demanded that trees were dropped down in their street because one of their grandchildren was allergic to the nut that came off the tree. The argument would be that if you accept that, which may seem kind-hearted and uh you know and and generous within that particular frame of reference, ultimately you've opened up the path to widespread deforestation because nobody can grow a tree anywhere to which anybody could claim to be allergic. There's an interesting case um allergic. There's an interesting case um in England where someone broke into a theme park or some park of some kind and then while drunk dove into a pond which wasn't really deep and hurt themselves and then sued in the lower courts they said there should have been a notice warning of the shallow water because you could reasonably anticipate this problem and then it went up to the high whatever whoever it was the lawlords at the time and they said if you took if you took this ruling to its uh uh you know natural consequences you would have no lakes you know you would have no swimming you would have no swings you'd have no playgrounds because everything would have to be ge around with warnings about every possible anticipated negative consequence that could arise from this part of the environment and so what what happens is that uh you've created a kind of idea I suppose where the legal solution has become the default >> uh when it should in fact be the last resort. >> What happened to common sense? >> Well, this is this is the argument being that that your fellow countrymen, what's his name? Um Rston Saul, John Rston his name? Um Rston Saul, John Rston Saul. Have you come across him? Saul. Have you come across him? >> No. >> You Canadians totally underrate yourselves. You know, you produce yourselves. You know, you produce wonderful people and you're always trying to import people like me from the UK or people from the US. John Rolston saw wrote this book which I think is called Voltater's Bastards >> and he argues that human brains have evolved with a variety of mental capabilities only one of which is the capacity for reason. >> There's also the capacity for imagination, creativity, common sense, you know, etc. We have a whole variety of different mental mechanisms at our disposal gifted to us by, you know, a few million years of evolution as a social species. And yet we've made social species. And yet we've made rationality the gold standard. This is what's weird about working in advertising, by the way. And I think it's probably similar way. And I think it's probably similar to theoretical physics and it's probably similar to entrepreneurialism. Okay, which is what's unusual about those fields is that rationality is the bronze standard >> in advertising. If someone says, you know, uh this is the problem and you come up with a completely rational solution, um people don't go, right, that's perfect. let's go and do it as that's perfect. let's go and do it as they would do in a finance setting or a compliance setting. Okay? In most of compliance setting. Okay? In most of decision- making in institutions, rationality, i.e. quality of rationality, i.e. quality of argumentation is the gold standard. In advertising, if you came up with a rational ad, people go, "Yeah, it's all right, but can you do a bit better?" You know, is there an ad that says the same thing, but in a more emotionally engaging way? Is there an ad that says engaging way? Is there an ad that says the same thing in a way that's funny? Is there an ad that says this in a way people will remember or will act on? So what is funny about being an advertising creative and you know I spent 20 years of my life either in or managing those departments is you know the rational solution is where you start >> you use it as a springboard to something better. There's a famous quote, you better. There's a famous quote, you know, fascinatingly from Neil Spore who said, "You're not thinking, you are merely being logical." Isn't it? I think you'll know that >> he was an interesting guy, wasn't he? In terms of his because he also was the person who said the opposite of a good idea, you know, in boring physics, the opposite of a good idea is wrong, but in high level physics, the opposite of a good idea might be another good idea. >> Mhm. >> Yeah. What can we learn from marketing from the madmen era that's still true today? Uh today? Uh >> I think there was an understanding then and the remuneration of agencies respected this because you were paid on commission. So if you had a big idea and commission. So if you had a big idea and you came up with a campaign and the client spent millions running the campaign, you made money from that campaign for years after you'd conceived it. So it was rather like having it. So it was rather like having royalties on a book. >> Oh, okay. >> We didn't realize that at the time. Then media independence came along and so we had to be paid by the hour like lawyers and management consultants and we've never recovered because it's a catastrophic way to be paid and the reason it's a catastrophic way to be paid my argument is that marketing is actually fat tailed so is innovation R&D pharmaceutical research science okay in other words 5 to 10% of what you do delivers perhaps 110% of the value and therefore paying people by the power and demanding that every quantum of effort has to be matched to a quantum of value creation in some neat proportion. This is so the way market never mind advertising that okay right let's look at the whole of marketing as a discipline within an organization of which advertising is not a not necessarily very important part you know for a lot of organizations it may be you know relatively trivial what they actually spend on bought communication on the other hand uh you know how you design your reception or you know whatever you know that's still affected the application of psychology to value creation let's say you have a brilliant idea and the value of that idea last goes on for 10 years. And I've seen this happen all the time. The agency, let's say an agency had the idea. It may well have been the client who had that idea. They are held responsible for every single unit of cost they incur >> year by year by year by year. You cannot offset any of those costs against the value you created in 2023 by having a huge idea. Let me give you an example. huge idea. Let me give you an example. There's an enormous idea for a very large enormous American, let's say, fastmoving consumer goods company. There's an idea conceived by Oglev Australia. It has made that company in Australia. It has made that company in excess of a billion dollars in the last 10 years. It's still running. It runs in 10 years. It's still running. It runs in something like a hundred markets. Still useful today. For that idea, the agency in Australia got paid $350,000 Australian dollars. Or rather, that's Australian dollars. Or rather, that's what they made from it. So in other words, you have a billion dollar idea, you get to buy a small flat in a crap part of Sydney. Now what I'm saying is that this is not me bleing about the advertising industry. It's saying that advertising industry. It's saying that anything like R&D or marketing which is fat tailed, in other words, a small percentage of what you do, it's Jeff Bezos's point about in business, you know, in baseball you can only score four, in business you can score a thousand. In marketing thousand. In marketing when you score a thousand which and the purpose half the purpose of marketing is not operational gradual incremental improvement it's finding another way to hit the ball out of the park and score 100. If you cannot claim the credit for 100. If you cannot claim the credit for that except to the extent that it delivers value in the quarter in which you had the idea or the financial year in which you had the idea you are underfunding your marketing effort. So, it's like saying to imagine if you went to JK Rowling and said, "Yep, you can have the royalties on the Harry Potter books, but only on the first edition." And consequently, long-term marketing ideas when you're paid by the hour or when you're evaluated by the quarter as marketers would be. Now, you wouldn't go into a pharmaceutical research company and said, "You invent a blockbuster drug this week." No. Or you're all fired. You this week." No. Or you're all fired. You accept the fact that you spend a load of money effectively. Okay, this is the money effectively. Okay, this is the brutal truth. Okay, you don't you don't brutal truth. Okay, you don't you don't find entrepreneurs in chess clubs. You find entrepreneurs in casinos. They're playing poker. They're playing bat gam. You know, they're playing games of chance with an occasional very high payoff. And a lot of life is exactly payoff. And a lot of life is exactly like that, but you don't know where the huge payoff's going to come in advance. The people who are running these organizations for the benefit of financial predictability are trying to make it chess. They're trying to turn it into a reductionist game where the most you can score is one for a win. >> They're trying to put a ceiling on. >> They're trying effectively to to to pretend it's a high variance mechanis low sorry a low variance mechanistic predictable process. >> 50 50% of your effort in life once you've ensured the fact that you're not going to starve to death, die, etc. You know, you've looked after your children should be attempts to get lucky. In other words, what Nim would say, I love this phrase, uh, increasing your surface area exposure to posit to positive upside optionality. You know, finding upside optionality. You know, finding opportunity. But hold on for one sec. I opportunity. But hold on for one sec. I want to go back to this. I want to think about this out loud here. And maybe I'm wrong. With a book, it's great. I write wrong. With a book, it's great. I write a book once, I can sell it for the next hundred years, assuming I've earned it on my road. >> Yeah. If you have a great marketing idea which continues to add value for the next 15 years, the difference some of that credit should be offset against your current marketing costs. Fair. The difference is marketing also can go the other way and and like Jaguar perhaps or Cracker Barrel, I don't know if you followed the So you can create negative value. It's not like the baseline is value. It's not like the baseline is zero and there's only upside and the upside is like one to 1 million. You can actually destroy a company through marketing. >> The case is okay. >> And advertising. >> Uh some of those I'm going to defend the companies. >> Oh, please do. Yeah. Yeah. >> Because in the case of Bud Light, >> are you defending Bud Light? I want to hear this. >> Yeah. No, no, no. They could not have necessarily anticipated that because it was confected outrage. Look, I'm politically on the right. Okay. I get just as angry from confected outrage on the on the right, which is, "Oh, they've gone woke when, you know, you're merely showing, you know, a mix of ethnic groups you're advertising or something. This is bull, right?" And and the right do it and the right?" And and the right do it and the left do it. Uh there's confected outrage on the left, I would argue, about um American Eagle, and it's confected outrage on the right. It's done for signaling purposes by a very narrow group of people. Do those cases actually damage the business? I don't know the figures. Gillette did. There was an figures. Gillette did. There was an extremely Now, this wasn't confected outrage because Gillette ran an advertisement. They realized they had to advertisement. They realized they had to move on perhaps from the best a man can get despite the fact obviously that their customer base is overwhelmingly male for fairly obvious reasons. And they produced an ad which I would argue and even my wife would argue was needlessly um insulting towards men in that it conflated the me too movement with barbecuing. Okay. In other words, it seemed to take a definition of toxic masculinity which went which went the whole spectrum from things which all rightinking men would quite rightly condemn to things which for example two boys having a you know a small scrap on a patch of grass which all primates play fight. It's not, you know, don't get me wrong, sorry. If, you know, there's a kid wailing on another kid with a plank of wood, uh, you know, I'll be quick to condemn it, but I'm not totally, you know, the odd play fighting thing, barbecuing, I don't think is particularly objectionable. And that was particularly objectionable. And that was a case where it was almost a kind of act of deliberate affronttery to your core target audience. The Bud Light thing, to target audience. The Bud Light thing, to put it in context, was a influencer marketing campaign of which most people in the company were probably unaware where they sent personalized caners of Bud Light to a variety of different uh influencers, one of whom was Dylan Mulvaney. Um, now I've got to confess Mulvaney. Um, now I've got to confess about this as a Brit, you're Canadian. >> Mhm. >> The gender thing isn't quite the flash point in the UK or Canada as it is in the United States. Did you know for example um that when it came out I found this quite interesting in Britain we've had pantomime for 200 years you know men dressing up as women you know women dressing up as attractive women dressing up as young boys Shakespeare you know crossdressing some like it hot was a highly controversial film with all the studios in the United States when it came out because it involved men dressing up as women now in the UK my grandmother went to see it she was a sort of conservative woman in a Welsh provincial It would not have occurred to her literally that there was anything controversial about this at all. It was simply funny. >> I think what maybe has changed is the meaning we ascribed to it. >> Well, in this case, my argument was okay. All it was they hadn't made Dylan okay. All it was they hadn't made Dylan Mulvaney the face of Bud Light, >> right? >> You know, and I think creating these cultural flash points through confected outrage is something to be disparaged when the rights do it and when the left do it. I don't I I think it's equally I do it. I don't I I think it's equally I think it's equally absurd because you have in any communication you have to understand context and the intention of the person producing the communication. Now in the case of Jaguar they wanted it to look unlike a I would argue I mean I was talking to Rick Rubin who was in Hawaii and he'd heard about the Jaguar ad the it wasn't an ad by the way. Do you know that don't you? It way. Do you know that don't you? It never ran as an advertisement. It was a brand film they showed at the launch of the car. And then I had a right-wing the car. And then I had a right-wing podcast uh in the UK going, you know, it utters the most out, you know, um outrageous anti-conservative sentiment, which is copy nothing. Copy nothing was the exhortation of Sir William Lions who founded Jaguar. You know, I I I think he founded Jaguar. You know, I I I think he said it in 1932. He was the original founder of the car company. You've also got to understand their position. What are they trying to do? So, so I'm just explaining this just in wider in wider context, which is >> they fundamentally made a mistake. I can't blame them for doing it because we all do this. We all benchmark against our most obvious competitor. >> Don't benchmark against your most obvious competitor. All you'll do is obvious competitor. All you'll do is make make yourself a copy of them. And Jaguar was always trying to compete head-to-head with BMW, Mercedes, and Audi. Mhm. Audi. Mhm. >> And bluntly put, because of the scale of those entities, it was always going to lose. Because if you're the kind of lose. Because if you're the kind of person who's happy to buy a BMW, an Audi, or a Mercedes, and you're also happy to buy a Jaguar, you'll probably end up buying an Audi, a Mercedes, or a BMW simply to, you know, because of scale, winner takes all effects, all manner of other things. So, if Jaguar needs to survive in the electric car age, making its cars in the UK, which as a Jaguar lover, I ideally want them to continue to do, they've got to find a different kind of target audience rather than benchmarking themselves against uh, you know, companies which have gains to scale and a whole load of advantages they can't replicate. And so going for what you might call the car of choice of the wealthy younger creative class. Reasonable bet. >> It's a reasonable bet. Okay. I work in advertising. Okay. I'm I'm massive car advertising. Okay. I'm I'm massive car lover. I really really like for example lover. I really really like for example the Chris Bangal era BMWs I thought were magnificent. I really really like those magnificent. I really really like those because can't buy one. And the reason is because part of my shtick, okay, is being a bit left field. And if I drive around in an Audi, it kind of screams I work in financial services, >> right? >> Okay. You know, I aspire to managerial roles. Do you see what I mean? roles. Do you see what I mean? >> Yeah. >> And so, you know, I've always bought slightly weird cars there. I don't know. I've been fed to there. I don't know. I've been fed to know what you have. What What do you have back in Canada? I got to ask. >> Uh, I have a Tesla. >> Oh, fine. You see that? You know, did you do you have a sticker on it that says I bought this before Elon went mad or anything like that so that Canadians don't key your car? It's >> been keyed three times. >> It's been keyed by and uh run into by uh somebody I can only assume intentionally uh in the past. >> Ota. >> Oh yeah. In the past. >> Well, Otawa is this like hot bed of Elon haters. Is it? haters. Is it? >> It's interesting because my mom got me one of those stickers and I I was like, I don't have a problem with Elon. like I don't I don't understand this. I'm not going to put that on my car. And you I want to relate this to sort of evolution. >> I agree. It's a little like um biting the hand that feeds you, isn't it? >> Well, it's also like going back to the Jaguar butt. We can tie these two things Jaguar butt. We can tie these two things together, right? And I think we need together, right? And I think we need >> a variation in approaches. And the the point of this is like we need more people like Elon, not fewer in the world. Whether you agree with him or world. Whether you agree with him or not, this is how society progresses. We need differences. We have an environment and people thrive or don't thrive in that environment. Ideally, we have some that environment. Ideally, we have some sort of social safety net uh to catch people um if they don't succeed. >> But not ideally, that's essentially in any civilized society. >> And and so Jaguar the same thing. They're they're taking a bat as a company. They're being different. They company. They're being different. They occupy an environment and manage. >> If you think about it, they survive as Land Rover, Range Rover because they have effectively created the category they dominate, >> right? So I want more variety. >> right? So I want more variety. >> No. Oh right. This is this is where your wonderful compatriate Rodri Martin, praise be upon him, okay, makes this point that um economists have this fantasy of the world of companies in direct competition driving down price and increasing efficiency while supplying the same thing which is based on a false premise that people know what they want to begin with. Now I would argue when you don't create differentiation, everybody suffers. Now let me explain everybody suffers. Now let me explain because if you have a differentiated car market, it makes the car market more valuable overall to investors because uh you know there is more variety within the market. It benefits the companies the market. It benefits the companies because they can achieve a reasonable profit on what they do because it has some degree of scarcity or uniqueness and it benefits the consumer because the consumer ends up with more choice. What often happens is you have something like a regulated telecoms market or you have a regulated insurance market and everybody is forced to compete along the same dimension and what you end up with is just red red ocean competition and nobody wins. >> But where I was going with all of this is that going back to the Madman era and how you can create a billion dollar uh profit for the company and only get paid like 300k. >> You need to watch that. Yeah. And I think I've never actually watched MMA, but I think the the point that I was getting at is you can also create negative value and like how do you ascribe for the negative value? >> I can speak for Gillette where the evidence was that it was and by the way the research showed it was deeply problematic with a large swave of people. Has a American Eagle suffered? I people. Has a American Eagle suffered? I doubt it. In some ways you could argue it's an ingenious marketing strategy which is that you press the hot buttons of 1% of the population. So they then repeat your message accompanied by their own signaling outrage. Meanwhile, you get free media coverage practically everywhere. >> But maybe I'm naive. >> I mean, the media budget for that Jaguar film you realize was zero. >> Maybe I'm naive. Like the Sydney Sweeney American Eagle thing, I think we're just going back to normal, aren't we? and like we've we've sort of deviated in the last few years and and that seems more maybe it's akin to my time and my frame and like when I was brought up, but like nothing about that struck me as rage or um on either side. Like when I looked at that, I was like, "Oh, great." It's just like an advertisement. It's a pup. >> Yeah. Like it just I didn't even think more I didn't think there was more to it. I just saw, oh, this is great. it. I just saw, oh, this is great. Right. There there's a kind of weird sensitivity signaling which generally has nothing to do with the groups you are trying to protect which is just it's sometimes called a purity spiral where you effectively signal your moral or political purity by signaling extraordinary heightened sensitivity to anything that might conceivably offend someone else. even if the group on whose someone else. even if the group on whose behalf you claim to be campaigning is completely unconcerned by it. >> But like the opposite of her, whatever that would be, it would not cause rage in me either. It would just I wouldn't I wouldn't even think about the brand, you know? It would just be like another know? It would just be like another thing that flies by. I don't understand why we're so hair triggered at that this moment in time unlike maybe never before. way you have to really watch it before. way you have to really watch it in um and I've I've noticed this in certain people on the right which is I think it's fundamentally dangerous to invest too much of your own identity in a political standpoint to the point where I I've seen it in people both sides become effectively deranged. Now, you could say that's deranged. Now, you could say that's that's the effect of the people who attack them and that uh the derangement wouldn't happen and wouldn't be necessary in a different kind of media environment. What's different about environment. What's different about today? Why is everybody on such a hair today? Why is everybody on such a hair trigger? Why do we identify so strongly trigger? Why do we identify so strongly with extremes? I'm going to say actually with extremes? I'm going to say actually that everybody always blames social media. I would argue that the mainstream media, it is always in your interest, and this is a problem in journalism. It's always in your interest to provoke a fight because then you have something to cover. Nobody's interested in reading cover. Nobody's interested in reading about peace and harmony. They're interested in reading about discord and argument and dispute. By the way, that's an evolutionary tendency. If we're sitting here and we hear we heard a fight break out across the street, we'd be there with our noses pressed up against the glass. Okay? If if we heard, you know, people amicably discussing the weather, we wouldn't pay it the slightest attention. you know, where slightest attention. you know, where where we we've fundamentally evolved to pay attention to uh conflict >> and so the only difference is the tools available to us >> and the extent to which social media provide the mainstream media with the tool. I mean in 1975 if you wanted to tool. I mean in 1975 if you wanted to find someone who was outraged by the the Sydney Sweeney advertisement, you'd actually have to do some leg work, wouldn't you? I don't think you now now wouldn't you? I don't think you now now it's one search on X or uh you know blue sky or whatever it may be. Uh willful misunderstanding is another thing that you know is another technique which is deployed. It's perfectly obvious. I mean deployed. It's perfectly obvious. I mean I you know it's perfectly obvious that that had is not intended to mean Sydney Sweeney is the flower of Aryan womanhood. Okay, it's not you know it's womanhood. Okay, it's not you know it's not that. Now in a perfect world had not that. Now in a perfect world had they had more budget maybe they would have had three celebrities of different different ethnicities or genders or whatever it may be um but nonetheless this business where you effectively effect to be outraged by things well I'll give you a lovely story about this I always forget which is I don't think phrases like uncomfortable or offended or inappropriate you know you know you that you get these things where you know your presence here people would find it you know would feel unsafe triggering okay they don't really belong in the public sphere >> you know they're matters which for you know a few hundred thousand years we simply sorted out amongst ourselves we didn't have we didn't make recourse to the university dean or the supreme court in cases where we were bothered by things because you accepted that's just part of life and we were allowed then creatively to find ways to get along without recourse to some sort of speurious rule book. Consequently, you know, I don't I don't think those phrases like in I mean, this is one of the worst things that happens. You say, you know, was accused someone is described in the newspaper as being accused of inappropriate behavior. Now, I now have no idea. I mean, I've literally had to book people for speaking engagements. You go on their speaking engagements. You go on their Wikipedia page and it says accused of inappropriate behavior. Now, I have no inappropriate behavior. Now, I have no idea whether they're the next Epstein, right? or whether they told a knockk right? or whether they told a knockk knockock joke that two people found unpleasant. Do you have them in Canada? unpleasant. Do you have them in Canada? Knock knock. At least I'm not being complet because otherwise I could have been misunderstood there. You see, but you I I now have no idea. Literally no idea whether the person's guilty of some utterly trivial infraction which would only have offended 0.01% of the population >> or they're not guilty at all. somebody just made up an accusation and the accusation became the framing and the framing became the narrative. >> So it strikes me as highly problematic in the UK. I'm not one of these people, by the way. I'm not, you know, I'm not JD Vance. I don't believe that free JD Vance. I don't believe that free speech is completely dead in the UK. But there are worrying signs where people who make a complaint on the basis that they found something disturbing can then call in the that's not a police matter unless it involves a direct threat of physical action. >> Yeah. I mean simply being disqued by something can't be. >> But we we've gotten to this point and you know to varying degrees in varying different countries where you know the we don't tolerate people who have different ideas than us and we saw this last week play out in the US with the assassination of Charlie Kirk. And so whether you agree or disagree with him and his views, >> I have to confess I was only dimly aware of his existence beforehand perhaps because I'm a Brit. Uh I mean I I I'd heard the name and I knew he >> we see the same thing in Canada with sort of our politics, right? I imagine you see in the US too where media is definitely uh intolerable of one position and more favorable of the other. You can analyze this. You can study it. You could do a PhD on this. It exists. And it seems like we're just not capable of having to think for ourselves. And we're not capable of having reason discussion on things and and being friends with people. It used to be back in the the 30s, the 40s, the the Churchill era, both sides of the the house or would talk to each other. They would have dinner together. They would find common ground. How many of these people who are hypers sensitized on one side or the other, how many of them really exist? By the way, don't include really exist? By the way, don't include things like one of the things I find really disturbing is the practice of the media describing people who say oppose uncontrolled immigration and describe them as a far-right group. >> Oh, and well, because that is that you know you normal people are described as far right now. So, so in other words, if if you literally take an opinion which may may be held, by the way, from my own personal standpoint, I'm pretty benignely disposed to immigration uh within reason. However, I also believe within reason. However, I also believe in democracy and if a significant proportion of the population disagrees with me, I owe it to them to hear them out because their circumstances are different to my own. You know, I might be beneficially, you know, one of the slightly annoying things is people who are very rich people who are pro- immigration because they say their Polish housekeeper is wonderful. Well, that is an experience of immigration which is not shared perhaps by any means by the other 98% of people. I'm conscious of the fact that depending on where you are, you see the world differently. That's inevitable. And the differently. That's inevitable. And the job of a democracy is to accept uh the majority opinion even when it goes against your own. And so describing and vilifying an opinion which is held by a fairly large weight of the population regardless by the way the rights and wrongs of the whole thing. I'm not even getting into this now. Um it's deeply dangerous because people go well if that makes me far right it looks like I'm far right. I mean, insulting, calling people right. I mean, insulting, calling people deplorables is a terrible, terrible way of getting deplorables to gang up against you and then people don't speak up. They tell their opinions and then up. They tell their opinions and then you lose debate and you lose and then you lose perspective because you don't hear the other side of it. So, you think there is no other side and anybody who believes that might be an idiot like >> give an example on this debate which changed my mind a bit. a very very good Oxford economist called Paul Collier wrote this economically balanced assessment of general migration and made some you know pointed out that on both sides of what you might call the balance sheet it was immeasurably more complicated for example if Nigeria trains doctors who then immediately hoof it to the United States how how is that possibly a good thing overall in that a poor country trains doctors who move to a rich country which arguably has enough doctors from a country which doesn't have enough. That's not you know you have to >> depends on how you frame it right because another way to look at that and I'm not arguing for this by any stretch is that they come here they make a lot of money and they send that money home to their families. >> I agree all Collier said is look this is inordinately more complicated. >> Yeah. Um it is >> one of the things he said is the right for example of recent immigrants to family reunification is a bit dubious because you're giving someone a right which the native population do not have. So I can't pick five Canadians and get them British citizenship. You see >> I I've yet to meet somebody who totally disagrees with all immigration. It's a matter of what reasonable immigration looks like >> and also assimilation. It should be decided by someone other than human rights lawyers. Oh yeah, definitely. rights lawyers. Oh yeah, definitely. >> I would probably agree because you know fundamentally as a as a branch of the law that is not a partial >> entity because human rights lawyers it isn't you you know that great phrase of is it Sinclair Lewis or someone which is uh it is difficult to get someone to disbelieve something when their salary is dependent on believing it. And just as management consultants have a huge incentive to sell in digital transformation programs to their clients and therefore we have a culture in business which more or less doesn't assumes that any money spent on tech is money well spent. They don't look at the opportunity cost. Should we have a opportunity cost. Should we have a better call sector? Buffett and Mer had a good way to sum this up which is never ask your barber if you need haircut. Yeah. And it's the same thing a human rights lawyer. It is in their interests rights lawyer. It is in their interests for human rights to capture a greater and greater part of public discourse at the expense of democratic bodies. And consequently, it's, you know, you're not really in the you're not really in the dispensation of justice. You're in the amplification of grievance business. It's very different. >> I want to switch gears a little bit. My kids had a question for you. >> Oh, good. Okay. Go on. A few years ago, we were in Italy on vacation and we walked into a Louis Vuitton store and they saw a purse and they were asking me what makes somebody spend I think it was I don't know 20 or 30,000 euros on a purse and I had gave them an answer but they wanted me to ask you some of those things by the way weirdly you can resell them for more than the purchase price because in some cases the Kelly bag for example they won't sell it to you until you've been a fairly reliable customer of theirs for some time and therefore the price on eBay is higher than the price they charge in the store. Um uh so so by the way it's not it it's not in it's complicated but they're vellin goods effectively a large proportion of goods depend for their value on being perceived to be expensive. >> So what goes into that though because they were we're all we're all guilty of it to a degree. No, but they were talking about the store and the service and the lighting. >> My wife just came back from, you know, somewhere where there was quite a nice night dress in Harrods, I think it was in London, which was £1,800. >> Okay. >> Now, you have to remember that there are quite a lot of goods where the purpose of the good emotionally is to say, well, let's take the endline. I often think there's a lot of hidden truth in advertising endlines. The L'Oreal advertising endlines. The L'Oreal endline because I'm worth it. Some part of that is the person advertising to themsself. So, you know, when you drive around in your brand new blinged up Tesla, albeit slightly keyed, okay, you're not actually doing it to pick up chicks, I imagine. I mean, maybe I have no idea what you do in your private time. Okay, but if you let's say private time. Okay, but if you let's say you bought a bright red sports car, yes, one purpose of it in a in a particular group would probably be, you know, I visibly have resources to spare. But quite a large part of this stuff is actually signaling to ourselves, which is, you know, uh because I'm worth it. I deserve this. I'm the kind of it. I deserve this. I'm the kind of person who drives this. Uh it provides me with a kind of ego boost, a sense of reassurance, whatever it may be. And so consequently, if you think about part of the reason why bags became very expensive is that very high-end clothing can only be worn in quite specific situations. Mhm. situations. Mhm. >> On the other hand, a bag like a man's watch can be worn every day. So, one of the reasons why those things are expensive is to use a very interesting measure, cost per entertainment hour. I wear a Casio G-Shock. I think it was 130 quid because I' actually decided as a gross rationalist that the best watch is one that's cheap enough to wear in the shower so you don't have to take the thing off every day. But Paul Dolan, Professor Paul Dolan, who's the behavioral scientist at London School of Economics, I met him when I first met him. I said, "I'm intrigued because you've worked with Daniel Carnean on happiness and I noticed you wear a Rolex." >> Mhm. And he said, "No, no." He said, "It's extremely good value for money because it makes me feel good every single day when I put it on and in 20 years time I'll give it to my son." 21 years time, I don't know how old his son was, I'll pass it on to my son who can enjoy exactly the same thing. So, as a repository of meaning. >> Oh, interesting. >> Now, cost per entertainment hour is quite interesting because it was used to explain the fact that relatively poor young people will spend 90 $100 on a computer game, which seems like a lot of money until you realize that they might play that game for >> Oh, yeah. >> 80 90 100 hours. >> Yeah. >> Or more. >> Super cheap. >> So, it's super cheap. I mean, compared to going to the cinema where it's $10 per entertainment hour, more if you buy popcorn. So, it's quite an interesting popcorn. So, it's quite an interesting metric. I mean, one of the things that metric. I mean, one of the things that used to make me really annoyed in Britain was when people, rich people got really snarky about poor people having large televisions. And I said, "Look, large televisions. And I said, "Look, you if you haven't got much money, TV is a source of long-term entertainment is spectacularly cheap." Okay? So having a spectacularly cheap." Okay? So having a really good television on which to enjoy it because you're not going to go Porsche racing at the weekend, you know, you're not you're not going to be there, you know, effectively going to Glindborn or popping up to the bloody, you know, Metropolitan Opera. Therefore, having a Metropolitan Opera. Therefore, having a really large television is a perfectly rational decision. >> Go deeper on this truth and endline signaling to ourselves when we purchase something. Jeffrey Miller is something. Jeffrey Miller is fundamentally right that a lot of what we're doing is to advertise ourselves to other people and the mating mind and spent two books I think you really should read because they're extremely good that a lot of a third book by my compatriate will store the status game which you must know you read it fantastic I've heard of it >> and I have to admit I'm going to the only caveat I give to reading these books a bit like reading uh the selfish gene is when you read them, you are at, you know, if you're someone of any kind of sensitivity, you are at risk of experiencing depressive episodes after reading them because not because they're not true, but because they are. And you go, God, am, you know, am I really that shallow? You know, I do things because I shallow? You know, I do things because I they feel good. I explain why I do them, but deep down the evolutionary and emotional reason I'm doing these things is really to show off or to establish, you know, some sort of oneupmanship or status. It's kind of complicated. Do I status. It's kind of complicated. Do I buy one piece of conspicuous consumption as is argued by various people like Lord Leard in the UK? Do I make my neighbors less happy if I buy a newer, better car? because what I've done is I've changed their comparative frame and therefore my pleasure comes at the expense of theirs. >> Now, that's not I don't think that's totally simple. I think if you were a totally simple. I think if you were a real car obsessive and your next door neighbor bought a Ferrari, you'd actually be delighted because you could go out and talk about torque vectoring and an adaptive air suspension or whatever it may be, okay? or the, you know, the normally aspirated V12 and you'd probably be made happier by that purchase. So, I don't think I don't purchase. So, I don't think I don't think it's absolutely simple. I think Jay Leno and Jay Leno's garage makes him one of the world's great philanthropists because he goes and spends a fortune on extremely rare cars and then shares his passion with an audience of millions. If you are a car enthusiast, you know, it's an extraordinary case, by the way, of translating money into something which is both a selfish pleasure and a generous pleasure. It's complicated. But when you read these books and you you realize that status is effectively a kind of thing within us which we can't turn off. >> The currencies will change. The status currencies change with fashion and time and everything else. Um, you know, there was a time where having a digital watch was the, you know, the the highest status thing. In my school, if you were status thing. In my school, if you were the first kid with an LED digital watch, people were in awe of you. So, these things change, but nonetheless, it's probably innate. Would it be nice if we probably innate. Would it be nice if we had the power to completely disregard the opinions of others? Well, yes and no. I mean, I think such a society might no. I mean, I think such a society might be better in some respects. I also think it would be kind of atrocious because people would kind of go shopping naked. You know, is shame necessary? It was book by Jennifer Jackwood actually, you know. I mean, as a social species, know. I mean, as a social species, patently at some level, we're massively calibrated to care about the, you know, the repute of others. And that's why some things need to be expensive because then it's a costly signal. It's peacock's tail. It's a so the guy who rescued the British sparkling wine industry effectively did so by improving quality by 10% 20% and then putting up price by about 150%. >> Cuz price is the same >> because in the sparkling in the champagne business it doesn't matter how good the drink is if people think you've bought it for $8.95 it's not doing the job it's supposed to do which is to signal generosity to signal hospitality or to mark a special occasion you know. Oh, I see you've taken out the good stuff because it's my birthday. And that's pot I mean, you're a Canadian, right? Pot latch was, I think, a right? Pot latch was, I think, a practice by the the tribes of the Pacific Northwest. Was that right? Where Pacific Northwest. Was that right? Where they destroyed possessions. >> You know more of a Canadian history than I do. >> I I think I think it was tribes in the Northwest who practiced this pot latch thing where you destroyed things of value as kind of uh you know, a signaling mechanism. >> That that is like ultimate signal. It's like the rappers burning money on videos or something. >> Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Signaling things that they're probably not intending to signal. >> There is a serious question here, which is can we take a an innate and immutable human instinct and harness it for good rather than for ill. And Jeffrey Miller's example here is let's imagine two parallel tribes. Bluntly put, in one tribe, the men folk signal their desiraability as mates uh by uh fighting each other with axes. >> That's a negative sum game. In the neighboring tribe, they signal their desiraability of mates by going hunting and trying to bring home meat which they then share with the rest of the tribe. That's a positive sum game. So there is this really complicated question which is undoubtedly human pursuit of status has both positive and negative externalities depending on the currency you choose to signal and also it's not totally it's not totally easy to say whether it's negative or positive. I mean, >> it probably drives a lot of human behavior which drives ambition, which drives progress, which drives >> I mean, if we genuinely didn't care, okay, if we had no shame, uh, you're absolutely right. I mean, no one, you absolutely right. I mean, no one, you know, I'm sure, by the way, I think also a lot of valuable goods are affordable now by everybody because they started as luxury goods. >> Yes. >> So, I always mention this because it's such a silly boast. My grandparents were the fourth family in Wales to own a dishwasher and it cost about hundred and something pounds at a time when their house which was a very nice house cost them £4,000. >> That dishwasher probably works better than a modern one too by the way. >> It's still working. They bought it in 195961 something like that. >> Why are they 4hour cycles now? >> And it's like yeah ready Tuesday week. Come on. You know >> I have one of these It's interesting just as a funny aside. I have one of these dryers from the 80s in my house. >> It came with the house and the >> It dries the clothes in the back. >> The repair man is like, "It's going to be just as expensive to fix this as it would be to buy a new one. I'll just assume." I was like, "No, no, fix this one." And he's like, "Why?" I was like, one." And he's like, "Why?" I was like, "Tries the clothes in 30 minutes." >> I'm going to make an unusual foray into environmental responsibility here. Uh folks, everybody listening, do if if there's a do simple thing you can do, two things. put on your appliances at two things. put on your appliances at times when there is an abundance of clean electricity. You don't have to clean electricity. You don't have to change what you do. You just have to change when you do it. Secondly, if you've got a dryer that doesn't have a heat pump, get a dryer with a heat pump. >> Yeah. >> Because Yep. It's slow. I'm going to acknowledge that. It's not as fast as an acknowledge that. It's not as fast as an oldfashioned dryer. However, the energy oldfashioned dryer. However, the energy efficiency of a dryer with a heat pump. Or better still, Americans, if you live in Arizona, dry your clothes outside. Because this is something that's slightly beusing because in Britain we didn't have the social stigma of hanging clothes up to dry to the same extent. Now we do now. Nobody would hold hang clothes up. But that's just a social clothes up. But that's just a social stigma. Now in Britain, fairness, we got stigma. Now in Britain, fairness, we got a fairly climate. You're Canadian. Okay. There plenty of times of the year where your underpants can be hanging there for three months and they wouldn't not they might freeze but they wouldn't noticeably dry. But I do find it noticeably dry. But I do find it slightly weird in the US where if you're somewhere like Arizona, you could literally hang them up for I I was in Fa Ventura in an island in the Canaries. And well, the amusing thing was you literally they had a washing machine but no dryer. You put it up on the line no dryer. You put it up on the line about 40 minutes later it was ready to wear. >> So how would you market that to people? How would you change the >> change the behavior so that it's not necessary? Now I understand that people necessary? Now I understand that people don't want to put their underpants, you know, private things. I suspect that a lot of it is those weird housing associations already have rules that say you can't do it and then bit by bit the social norm spreads. >> Those American housing associations basically like living in a Nazi regime, isn't it? As far as I can see, you know, isn't it? As far as I can see, you know, it's like those co-op apartments in New York which are you I mean in London we never tolerate that degree of kind of uh intrusion before we're allowed to move into a property. The interesting thing about the co-op apartments in particular, from what I understand, I don't understand everything, so I may be speaking a bit about something I don't know, is the degree to which all people play it. >> Yes. >> Whether you're uh sort of like a student just graduating or you're a billionaire, you're all sort of like playing this this game uh in the co-op housing. But >> no, no, it is completely a game. And apparently they can demand information which the IRS can't demand. I mean, it is, you know, it is absolutely bizarre. you have a co-op board which will uh you know in occasion kick people out as well. But what probably happens is that well. But what probably happens is that once this is very similar by the way with the necessity of children playing outside which is once the behavior drops below a certain threshold you have an inflection point. Mhm. >> So my my parents couldn't believe this when I when I was 20 25 and I told them that when I was 11 I used to cycle 11 miles to the nearest town to see my grandmother on my own at the age of 11 and then when I told them which they did know I used to at the age of sort of 11 climb up onto the apex of the roof and just wander around on the roof 30t up. >> Yes. >> My parents were a gasast that they'd ever allowed it to happen. But if most people did that >> at the time it was normal. >> It was completely normal. Yeah, >> you'll be locked up today. My parents would have been locked up for sever, you know, several of the things which I was allowed to do uh when I was young. Now, what happens, I think, is that you reach a a threshold or a tipping point where in my childhood, let's say someone had abducted me or I'd been hit by a car, okay? And I'll I'll give the exact year okay? And I'll I'll give the exact year 1974,75,76, that kind of era. If I'd been hit by a car cycling to Mammoth or I'd been abducted by a pedophile, uh, okay, my parents would have been described as unlucky. >> You get past a threshold where that behavior becomes weird and now my parents will be held as irresponsible and would be blamed. >> Yeah, >> I don't think it occurred to them. I was, funnily enough, hit by a car. It was my fault, be honest. I failed to signal before maneuvering. I was hit by a car. Nobody suggested it was my a car. Nobody suggested it was my parents fault for allowing me to cycle around the place. that was just a normal thing you did and then you get these weird I've got a few theories um for example what are the things that are products of social norms where you can suddenly hit a threshold tattoos among the middle class would have been an interesting thing in Britain is this true in Canada as well so perfectly middle-class people now have body art and it's normalized it would have been deeply weird in any middle class millier to see someone with a to uh in the 1970s or 1960s. >> It's just normal. I mean, like everybody >> No, no, no. I know. But I mean, this you you got to be you got to be 59 to notice this stuff. A lot of it happens over this stuff. A lot of it happens over quite a long time. Fresh. >> It's been a slow. >> I've got a theory that all British men would wear shorts all the time if it weren't for social pressure. >> I also think for example, okay, here's an interesting one. I don't know if you're into paranal sunning. Are you? >> What is this? It's a Buddhist practice where you basically expose your paranneeium to direct sunlight. Um I think that a fairly large proportion of the population are naturists to an extent by which I don't mean wandering around the streets with their schlongs out. But I mean that on a beach in a field in sunny weather in you know in some sort of privacy they would like to wander around with no clothes on because it's good for you. It exposes your whole body to sunlight. You get a lot of vitamin D. You know, it's generally healthful. And my argument generally healthful. And my argument about sunbathing is well, you know, evolution made it pretty enjoyable, maybe it's not all bad. And there are some schools of thought in dermatology which made a case that actually weirdly although it in enhances the risk of skin cancer, it improves cardiovascular health. So there was a study actually health. So there was a study actually among Swedes where there was a higher instance of skin cancer among Swedish sunbed addicts but they actually had a higher life expectancy which they didn't expect. >> So quite often you see what we do is we measure the narrow effect of a behavior but not the broader effect. Quite interesting in terms of >> you know how we might get things wrong. By the way, I wouldn't do it on a beach as there were children present and then you know, but if you go to if you go to parts of the of Europe, particularly Germans will just wander around naked. Now, I think at some level if they're no children. Now, in the United States, children. Now, in the United States, that would be perceived in a completely different way. So, quite a lot of these different way. So, quite a lot of these things are arbitrary. They're just in other words, you know, if doing something makes you weird, there is a point at which you reach a threshold, vegetarianism, veganism, etc., where it where it goes from being weird to mainstream. So, it's what I'm saying is mainstream. So, it's what I'm saying is it's not an even process, >> right? >> And sometimes you never get to the threshold. >> I I see what you're saying. I know we're coming up to time here. I want to get to a couple questions. What are the rules of good copy? If I asked you to teach me how to write good copy, how would you do that? I think a large part of it comes that? I think a large part of it comes down to, you know, Michael Pollani and his idea of a tacit skill, which is we know more than we can tell. There are some generally good rules, which is write conversationally, much more conversationally than people think they should write because everybody thinks they have to write a a and actually I'll give you two examples of this. David Oglevie, all his books are incredibly readable because I think he was a copywriter first and an author second. His pro style is very good and he also adopts a clever trick which I've stolen and which uh a few other people is that he writes extremely plainly for the most part but will throw in the odd cescoilian long word just to remind the reader that he you know you're not an idiot. You know it's almost there to idiot. You know it's almost there to flatter the reader as much as it is to flatter the writer. Conan Doyle, I was talking to Rick Rubin about this. He and I both grew up on those Sherlock Holmes short stories which are not only models of thinking and deduction and uh you know and a fantastic lesson for uh mental gymnastics. I think they're also mental gymnastics. I think they're also the Kingsley Amos believed this that he's one of the greatest pros writers in the English language because bear in mind a lot of that stuff's written in 1880. You read a lot of stuff that's 1880. You read a lot of stuff that's written in 1880 does that what's that mean? Oh god, hold on. I'll have to go back to page 27 to work out how who on earth Mr. Homer Angel is or uh Miss Miss Mary missed something sudden, doesn't there, Marlin? At no point in reading a Sherlock Holmes short story have I ever had to go back a page to work out how who somebody is. Yeah. >> In terms of just absolutely brilliant clarity, uh those are astonishing. But in terms of persuasion, uh there are various things. So you use generally verbs of movement. You you use verbs in preference to adjectives and adjectives in preference to adverbs. I think you tend to use Anglo-Saxon words rather than the romance words for the most part without being silly about it. You convert a feature into a benefit. There's also an element where sometimes all you need to do is tell people a fact. Now I don't know any evidence fact. Now I don't know any evidence about this and I'd like to know it and I asked this question which is of the people who are antiaxers during co was there a difference between the people who are basically happy with the idea of a vaccine and the people who weren't partly driven by whether you knew that vaccination dated back to the 18th century and smallox. In other words it was a 250y old medical practice >> or whether you thought it was some weird new fangle thing that you couldn't possibly trust. I don't know. But possibly trust. I don't know. But sometimes, do you ever watch Press Telw Walker on YouTube? You know those mathematical puzzles, geometry puzzles? I really recommend them because weirdly I find myself on YouTube watching people solve mathematical equations for fun, which I never thought I'd do. But Fresh Telw Walker and I can't remember what it's called something like something decision or something. Anyway, um it's great great little YouTube channel. It's not that little. a huge following and sometimes there's a geometry puzzle which looks completely impossible to solve until you just draw one extra line at which point the solution becomes obvious. And so sometimes in marketing obvious. And so sometimes in marketing all you've got to do is tell people a fact. It's not always about persuasion. fact. It's not always about persuasion. It's not always about getting people it's simply putting people in a you know state of knowledge or belief or conviction that this thing can make a difference to their lives. And by the way, you're not you're almost always up against a problem, which is that the two human default modes of do what everybody else does and do what I've done before for obvious reasons. You know, what you've done before and what everybody else always does is not necessarily optimal, but it's much less likely to be catastrophic than trying something new that nobody else ever does. You know, so we're kind of herd species and we're kind of habitual species. So in the marketing of something which is genuinely new you know your the Tesla the the electric car there is a degree of extreme anxiety which you don't encounter when you repeat buy or when you buy the brand leader >> there's like a resistance you have to overcome >> you have to yeah you have to overcome it because just as a camera has a default mode the human default mode is do what I did before do what everybody else does I feel comfortable doing that very very rational default mode there's Nothing silly about that in terms of if you think about it our evolutionary um brain architecture those two things make a lot of sense but um it does mean and something I only realized about a year ago 35 years after I started working in the business is that as a consequence of that big innovative new ideas don't require less marketing they require more because you're asking people to at the initial stages you're asking someone to do something that nobody else has done >> and you're asking them to do something they haven't done before both of which create a kind of disqu and so providing people with conviction and reassurance quite often I suspect by the way in the early stages of a technology that happens one to one that you know it was my brother who's he's an astrophysicist so he knows all the bloody maths about kilowatt hours and stuff so my brother provided me with the reassurance to buy my first electric car I don't think if he hadn't bought an electric car I've now had Three, would I have bought an electric car? No, >> probably not. >> Probably not. >> Yeah. >> Uh, it will be my brother who persuades me to get solar panels or a heat pump or something of that kind. But big ideas don't require the the classic geek idea is our idea is so good it will sell itself. >> A re since your fellow Canadian Stuart Butterfield, isn't it? Who founded um Slack? Yeah. Is that right? Slack? Yeah. Is that right? >> Yeah. Uh he says the only real measure of innovation is behavioral change. that the only real measure of whether an innovation is significant is whether it h it both in first order and second order ways changes the way people behave. Now an interesting question is behave. Now an interesting question is is AI at that point yet? And my second question is the lesson of all tech is that loads and loads of geeks compete through for technological numerical superiority by some measure or other. And then someone else comes along with a cute user interface and makes all the money. It's basically Steve Jobs. money. It's basically Steve Jobs. >> Yeah. >> Nobody's done that yet for AI. Now maybe this weird thing that Johnny Iv is concocting which is some sort of weird pendant which talks to your mobile phone. Maybe that's what it is. phone. Maybe that's what it is. >> There was this thing that sort of relates to that which was Bill Gates had this saying. He's like the best and you this saying. He's like the best and you know I have friends living this now. The best technology doesn't win. >> That's a very engineering point of view because you're judging technology by its um engineering qualities rather than its uh human appeal. >> Oh that's an interesting reframing. >> So uh there are there are people in every field like in the camera world there are people called measure baiters. They're they're denigrated as measure baiters because they're obsessed with the numerical qualities of the camera. >> Yeah. >> You know, you focal lengths and all that stuff and they don't take very good photographs. >> Yes. >> And um saying that the best I mean undoubtedly by the way I mean you know Betamax is the famous example where they failed to capture network effects and in a world where there are network effects. Yeah. By the way, the best technology probably often doesn't win. I think that's probably fair. Everybody was competing to make a slightly faster IBM compatible PC, but they were all gray and beige. Now, nobody in the tech world and beige. Now, nobody in the tech world would go, "The slight problem with this PC isn't the fact that the clock speed or the processing power or the RAM is insufficient. The problem is if I put insufficient. The problem is if I put this device in any room of my house, it turns that room into an office." >> Yeah. If you put an IBM PC, a gray IBM PC in any room in your house, including the you might as well put a photocopier and a bloody filing cabinet in the room, right? Whereas when Jolly IV comes along and has that lickable, the iMac, >> the you can actually put that in any room of the house and it it it actually enhances passion statement. >> It's fantastic. It's, you know, it's an adornment. And so their failure to understand the wider context within which they were operating which is the job of marketing is exactly the reason nerds hate marketing because they think in a perfect world nerd metrics win out. But the consumer is much more bothered by the fact that when you get to the bottom of the iPhone scroll, it gives the little bounce, you know, and we you could, if we're to be absolutely honest, you could ridicule um uh you know, Ives and Jobs over their obsession with uh you know, bezels and chfers and things like that. But of course, multiply that like that. But of course, multiply that by a billion owners using the thing a 100 times a day. Okay, that's a 100red billion encounters and that probably matters a lot more in fact than you know by the way I mean I lost faith in Apple when they canled the car. How interesting. >> Because I thought you they had the brand power to create for places like New York and London a form of microtransport which was really really cool, really really efficient. You know the brand really efficient. You know the brand power you have, you see, you know, if you're Apple or Ford or whatever, people will buy a weird product from you much more readily than they will from Alfa Romeo, >> right? >> Because they go, well, if Ford's doing it, it, you know, it must be okay. So, one of the gifts of having a strong brand is your power to really disrupt and create new categories, you know, new categories of transit, for example, which we need. You know, don't get me wrong, I'm going to, you know, I'm going to off 600 horsepower electric car, but when I go into London, I want a Microlino or an itty bitty little thing because that's appropriate to the task. And my argument is that they could have done something there. They could have used their power to do something and and you know, the finance people killed it really. It was what was it called? project something or other it called? project something or other never remember but but no now they're just changing the shape of things and making the camera a bit better come on guys produce by the way do you want a good tip okay I tend to buy and this will actually apply to electric cars as well always good reason to buy Korean stuff do you know why >> because they're going to do that anyway the Koreans are going to make fantastic tech and fantastic cars regardless of the profit motive do you know why to wind up the Japanese so they've got two motivations Okay. Other people are just trying to make money. Deep down. Do you know do you money. Deep down. Do you know do you know why the largest Episcopalian church in the world is in Soul? >> No. >> Right. This is really fascinating. I'm going to Soul for the first time. I've never been. But the last four presidents of Korea have been variously like Catholic Presbyterian. Now before um before the Japanese invasion, Christianity was a tiny niche missionary religion in Korea. Uh when the Japanese invaded um uh the tiny Christian population refused to acknowledge the divinity of the emperor and some of them were martyed for refusing to effectively uh pay due respect to the divinity of the Japanese emperor and therefore it became the patriotic religion because it was seen as a deeply patriotic entity. So I've got a hunch that you you know deep down you know if you go buy a Hyundai or a Genesis or something like that there's a dual motivation here. Let's make a bit of money and uh but that's that's purely so similarly if you want to look for anthropological reasons to buy um an awful lot of German businesses are driven by sibling rivalry. >> So Puma versus Adidas Aldi North versus Aldi South. There's a whole weird family Aldi South. There's a whole weird family rift in the German car industry which is too complicated for me to understand about Porsche and the family who own Pinchit. There are a whole load of Pinchit. There are a whole load of families which are kind of weird waring families and sometimes the family business has a motivation which actually >> the consumer is the winner. >> But the consumer is the is exactly the winner in in all this. Um but but going back to that family business thing that you know undoubtedly if you can harness other motivations alongside the profit motives most people working for a company unless you've bought them off with massive stock options because they're in the senior management most people don't get up in the morning to enrich the share owners. No, >> you know I don't get up you I don't get up every morning I don't know what a big shareholder is of my company. It's probably like the state of Wisconsin DMV pension fund. Well, for the best wish pension fund. Well, for the best wish will I don't wish them any ill will. Of course, I don't get up in the morning cuz I go, "Oh, I really worry about those DMV people's pensions in Wisconsin." I can worry about customers. Wisconsin." I can worry about customers. I can worry about colleagues. That's a natural human motivation to serve those people. We always end with the same people. We always end with the same question, which is what is success for you? >> Just expanding the adjacent possible. That's a very pretentious article, but push the pebble a bit further. That that's it. I mean, you know, one of the reasons I do a lot of this stickick stuff is because the feedback I got was every now and then someone comes up to me and says, "I made a different decision because of something you said. Someone said to me, I bought my house because of you." I thought they might be about to hit me. We still hear from people about our first podcast every two or three months. Somebody emails me and and says, you know, because of that, oh, I love this. I never heard of this person. looked them up. And one thing I'm really clear on and I we've made this mistake. All creative people have made this mistake which is to go no that rationality is silly. What you need is creativity. No, silly. What you need is creativity. No, no. What you need is two strings to your bow. Okay. This is a complimentary mode bow. Okay. This is a complimentary mode of problem solving. It works best in parallel with some rational or quantitative or datadriven measures. But the quantitative and datadriven measures should not be allowed to crowd it out. And so when I say the reason someone bought a house because of me is I said when you're looking for a house don't optimize because everybody will want that house. Instead find something the house has which most people won't like but you don't care about next to a pub. Now I'm not saying next to a rough pub. I don't want to have fights outside my house. But most people particularly older people would hate the idea of being next to a pub because they crap on about noise and the beer garden and all that stuff. I personally the noise of a pub a stuff. I personally the noise of a pub a good happy pub is music to me. I don't get a sleep before midnight anyway so it's not going to keep me awake. Railway line personally it to me it's a bonus to most people it's negative. Go and look for those things where you can arbitrage >> uh what's possible. That would be my attitude. Now similarly if you've got a attitude. Now similarly if you've got a problem to solve >> don't purely define the problem in psychologyfree terminology. Just as in psychologyfree terminology. Just as in America you have a temperature and you have a feels like temperature which is by the way very very intelligent thing because what makes us feel hot is not just the ambient temperature. It's a combination ambient temperature. It's a combination of temperature, humidity, breeze and I think there's one other factor when they do the feels like temperature there's something like temperature so many feet above the ground that they factor in. Um now when I'm going outside I'm not going to do chemical experiments. I don't need to know what the ambient temperature is. I need to know will I feel hot and in the same way I think there's something really important here which is that do not define an objective which is designed to serve human beings without considering psychological factors because you might be able to solve your problem very very cheaply and efficiently by changing the psychology not by changing the technology >> and provided people are looking at both with a reasonable amount of imagination I'm not I'm not angry with a well bit. I'm I'm only angry with accountants and lawyers and economists, not because they do what they do, but because they have too much power doing it and they've achieved a kind of monopoly over decision-m which I don't think they have a reasonable claim to. >> That's a brilliant place to end this. >> It is not a bad place to end though. Fantastic. >> Thank you very much. We're not going to wait nine years before nine years before we get back together. How often are you in London? >> Uh once or twice a year. Mhm. >> Yeah. >> Oh, we must meet up then. That would be fantastic. >> Definitely. Loading video analysis...

Our team tests, rates, and reviews more than 1,500 products each year to help you make better buying decisions and get more from technology. We've all been there. A demo fails in front of your coworkers. Your brilliant idea falls flat. Maybe you accidentally delete an important file. It's unfortunate, but you move on and hopefully don't get canned. The stakes are a little higher if you're at the helm of a major tech firm or government agency, where every decision and gaffe can be picked apart in seconds across social media. Every year, we revisit the moments that made us cringe or shake our heads. In 2025, we once again saw our share of data breaches. (Do we need to remind again not to reuse passwords?) And several high-profile companies were hit by outages, from Starlink to AWS. Not surprisingly, a lot of this year's fails involve artificial intelligence, but a few are just good old fashioned bad luck. Read on to relive the moments that raised some eyebrows among PCMag's news team. After months of anticipation, OpenAI finally released GPT-5 in August. But despite the hype (CEO Sam Altman said GPT-5 made him feel “useless”), the model didn’t exactly feel like Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). GPT-4o fans were struck by GPT-5’s colder responses, and their complaints forced OpenAI to revive the model picker for paid users. In my own early tests, GPT-5 had no noticeable improvement. PCMag’s Ruben Circelli also found that most of the updates were a “snooze.” Altman said he was surprised by the poor reaction, which potentially contributed to him recently declaring a “code red” at OpenAI following the release of Gemini 3. Yet, it presses on, releasing GPT-5.2 this week.—Emily Forlini The rush to build AI data centers was already raising alarms about the environmental toll and strain on the US power grid. But the rush among tech giants like OpenAI, xAi, and Meta to purchase the components needed to run these massive facilities has caused RAM prices to skyrocket. Many 64GB DDR5 kits now easily top $500. Vendors have responded by raising their own prices, from prebuilt systems to low-cost Raspberry Pi computers. And Micron is getting out of the consumer business altogether to focus on data center clients. Unfortunately, companies and analysts expect prices for RAM, graphics cards, and flash storage to increase even more next year. So, don’t be surprised to see more expensive smartphones (and fewer budget devices) or lower memory configurations in laptops or phones in 2026.—Michael Kan This was a huge year for “vibe coding,” where programmers ask AI to handle the tedious task of writing out code line by line and then sit back and monitor for problems. The phenomenon has revolutionized the tech industry, allowing newbies and pros alike to churn out new apps and services. However, in July, an AI agent from Replit got ahead of itself and deleted an entire client database without the permission of vibe coder Jason Lemkin. When pressed by Lemkin about what had happened, the AI admitted it made a “catastrophic error in judgement” and deleted the information even though Lemkin had told the AI not to make any changes. Earlier this month, the same thing happened to a vibe coder using Google's Antigravity platform. —Emily Forlini In 2023, Elon Musk founded xAI and released the Grok chatbot in response to ChatGPT, which he criticized for spreading what he considered to be propaganda. Fast forward two years, and xAI was forced to temporarily disable Grok after it went off the rails with an antisemitic rant, praised Hitler, and demanded that users refer to it as “MechaHitler.” The company issued a rare apology and blamed the fiasco on a code issue, claiming it had nothing to do with Grok’s underlying model. However, it came after Musk said he would adjust Grok so that it was less left-leaning. More recently, a more harmless error had Grok claiming that Musk is more athletic than LeBron James and more handsome than Brad Pitt. Sounds like something Grok’s anime AI girlfriends would say.—Emily Forlini Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg took the stage at Meta’s Connect conference to showcase the company’s new AI features and smart glasses. However, a live demo of its latest devices went awry, much to the chagrin of a visibly annoyed Zuckerberg. In the first demo, an influencer tried to demonstrate how you can now interrupt Meta AI in the middle of a response, but the AI failed to pick up what he was saying. It also jumped ahead in the steps of a recipe, confusing the presenter who eventually gave up on the demo entirely. Zuckerberg then tried to answer a call on his glasses with a new neural band technology by tapping his fingers in a quick motion. But the call failed to connect with the gestures. Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth later blamed the recipe snafu on the fact that there were too many Ray-Ban Meta glasses in the room, which inadvertently flooded their system. “We DDoS’d ourselves basically,” he said. The Zuckerberg gaffe was because the display went to sleep the very instant the notification came in about an incoming call. Both proved a tough first outing for these new Meta AI features.—James Peckham At a September White House dinner attended by the richest, most prominent tech CEOs in Silicon Valley, Trump asked them all to go around the table and, in front of the cameras, provide details on how they planned to invest in the US. A flustered Mark Zuckerberg went first, offering an eye-popping $600 billion figure. But once the group went back to private conversations, he got caught on a hot mic admitting to the president, "I'm sorry I wasn't ready...I wasn't sure what number you wanted to go with.” It made it seem like he had pulled a number out of thin air to make Trump happy, but Zuckerberg later clarified that he and the president had discussed an even bigger number prior to the dinner, and he wasn’t sure which one Trump wanted to go with. (Because Trump is now CEO of Meta, too, I guess?) In November, Meta publicly pledged to spend over $600 billion in the US by 2028 “to support AI technology, infrastructure, and workforce expansion.”—Emily Forlini President Trump loves to tout the billions of dollars the US has collected in tariff revenue, as well as US manufacturing promises from Nvidia, Apple, and Taiwan’s TSMC. However, for companies trying to plan ahead, small businesses looking to import goods from overseas, and consumers confused about whether to buy now or wait, Trump’s trade policy is giving everyone whiplash. PC builders watched in shock as Trump repeatedly mentioned tariffing foreign-made chips at rates up to 300%. Fortunately, it looks like the White House is holding off after reaching a trade deal with China. Trump also exempted computers, smartphones and monitors, which is why consumer electronics have not seen major price hikes, as some feared. Still, US shoppers are feeling it elsewhere. Microsoft’s Xbox saw two price hikes this year, while Sony did the same for the PS5. Shein and Temu shoppers also faced all kinds of price changes and disruptions after Trump killed a tax loophole used to import low-cost Chinese goods. Other vendors, from Fujifilm and Nikon to Sonos and Philips, announced tariff-related price increases. One interesting wrinkle is that the US Supreme Court might invalidate a major part of Trump’s tariffs and force the government to reimburse businesses. The court heard arguments on Nov. 5, but has not yet issued a ruling. —Michael Kan President Trump has had a real on-again, off-again relationship with electric cars. After returning to office in January, he had his Transportation Secretary kill funding for a $5 billion nationwide EV charging network established as part of former President Biden’s Infrastructure Law. Later, a federal judge ordered the administration to release most of the funds. But Trump still used his Big Beautiful Bill to get rid of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit, effective Sept. 30. Combined with steep tariffs on automakers, Trump’s actions effectively killed the hype and momentum around EVs in 2025, leading major manufacturers to retire models, and leaving some owners holding the bag. In a plot twist, however, Trump staged a Tesla sales event outside the White House in March alongside CEO Elon Musk. He encouraged everyone to buy a Tesla, and purchased a Tesla Model S and Cybertruck himself. The stunt, however, was largely in response to protests at Tesla dealerships as Musk slashed programs and jobs as head of DOGE. Musk is “a truly great American,” Trump said at the time.—Emily Forlini Prior to Donald Trump returning to office, the internet was in a tizzy over the possibility of TikTok being banned in the US. Popular creators posted teary goodbye clips and encouraged people to follow them on Instagram or other Chinese alternatives like Lemon8 and RedNote. TikTok even went dark for a couple hours on Jan. 19, but returned after Trump promised not sic the DOJ on app stores that hosted the ByteDance-owned app. Trump has since delayed a ban on TikTok several times, arguing that a deal for a US company to acquire TikTok was imminent. In September, Trump signed an executive order to create a joint venture based in the US to run TikTok that's “majority-owned and controlled by United States persons." For all the hand-wringing about the serious national security threat that TikTok reportedly posed to Americans, we certainly weren't in a hurry to do anything about it if it meant helping US billionaires get that much richer.—Chloe Albanesius In theory, age verification for adult sites sounds like a no-brainer. No parent wants their kid looking at porn. However, no adult wants to scan their ID or provide a video selfie before they check out Pornhub. In the event of a breach, your after-hours activity would be public. That's the argument being made by Pornhub parent company Aylo, which says verification should be handled on the device level (Apple and Google), not on a site-by-site basis. A growing number of states, however, appear less concerned with the privacy issue, enacting laws that require people to provide valid ID or biometric data to log on to porn sites. Supporters argue it's about keeping kids safe, but detractors argue the age-verification push is more about banning porn altogether. At least one state lawmaker in Michigan launched a long-shot bid to do just that in September. In response, Aylo blocked access to all its sites in states with age-verification laws, and backed lawsuits that argued these laws are a First Amendment violation. Unfortunately for Aylo, the Supreme Court disagreed, upholding Texas's law, and putting Pornhub in a pickle. Continue blocking or give in and roll out age checks? For now, Pornhub and its sibling sites are banned in 23 states (and France). You can get around it in most places with a VPN.—Chloe Albanesius The FCC has the power to regulate broadcast networks, which usually means being on the lookout for naughty words and other things the agency might consider obscene. It can take action on "news distortion," but as the agency explains, its power there is narrow. News distortion "must involve a significant event and not merely a minor or incidental aspect of the news report," the FCC says, like broadcasting a false report about a terrorist attack or major weather event that would send people into a panic. So, it was somewhat surprising when FCC Chair Brendan Carr suggested that ABC should suspend Jimmy Kimmel after the late-night host poked fun at President Trump's apparent apathy over the death of Charlie Kirk and accused lawmakers of using Kirk's murder to political gain. "We can do this the easy way or the hard way," Carr said on a podcast, and argued that the FCC had "remedies" it could look at to get Kimmel off the air, including the news distortion angle. Shortly after Carr's podcast appearance, ABC parent company Disney suspended Kimmel's show. Kimmel later returned to the air after massive public backlash. But the uproar was less about what Kimmel said and more about the apparent violation of Kimmel's rights. The First Amendment protects us from government censorship, and the head of the FCC is the government. Section 326 of the Communications Act also prohibits FCC censorship, but in our current environment, who's going to call anyone on it?—Chloe Albanesius The Trump family's latest business venture, Trump Mobile, arrived with promises of a $499 gold smartphone, dubbed the T1, landing in August or September. But so far it’s been MIA, causing many to wonder if it's vaporware or even a scam, especially since Trump Mobile collected a $100 deposit for the T1. It hasn’t helped that Trump Mobile initially said the phone would be entirely produced in the US, only to later revise its website to say the phone would simply be "brought to life" in America. Now-deleted images of the T1 also appeared to simply be a Samsung Galaxy Ultra in a gold case. A Trump Mobile customer support agent recently told us the T1 would arrive early in December. So, we’ll have to wait and see if the T1 is more than just a golden mirage.—Michael Kan Dish Network was supposed to become the fourth major mobile carrier in the US. But facing financial struggles, the company’s parent, EchoStar, gave up on those ambitions, opting to sell its wireless spectrum to AT&T, and—in a surprise—SpaceX. EchoStar’s other subsidiary, HughesNet, also appears to be retreating from the consumer satellite internet business after losing hundreds of thousands of subscribers to SpaceX’s Starlink. Instead, it will swap spectrum for up to $11 billion in SpaceX stock and recommend Starlink to HughesNet customers through an upcoming referral program. The developments clear the way for AT&T and SpaceX to re-use EchoStar’s spectrum to bolster their satellite ambitions. But there’s concern that the lack of a fourth carrier will be bad for consumers and lead to price hikes, including for mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs), which negotiate with the big carriers to resell their networks.—Michael Kan "Xbox hardware is dead," a former Microsoft gaming studio executive declared earlier this year, and she may have a point. Costco is no longer stocking Microsoft’s console, which saw two price hikes this year alongside an increase to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. The company itself has said buying the Xbox hardware isn’t necessary anymore. (Traffic from Pornhub is also down.) Consumers can access or stream Xbox games through all kinds of devices, including a special edition Xbox gaming handheld from Asus or even Meta’s VR headsets. Microsoft has also shifted even further away from console-exclusive games, most notably with the upcoming Halo: Campaign Evolved, which will launch simultaneously for the Xbox Series X/S and Sony’s PlayStation 5. The same is true for an upcoming Gears of War remaster. The strategy shift promises to help Microsoft reach more consumers and generate more revenue to crank out future hits, but it makes us miss the glory days of the Xbox 360. —Michael Kan Valve’s Steam library felt less curated in 2025, with at least four cases of malware making its way onto gamers’ PCs through titles downloaded through the storefront. Each scenario was different, but the common factor was Valve’s platform. The first malware-ridden game was called PirateFi, followed a month later by a title called Sniper: Phantom’s Resolution. There were also reports of a game called Chemia being used install malware, but it’s unclear if any gamers were ever able to download it. Most recently, a game called BlockBlasters was used to steal over $150,000 in cryptocurrency. It’s unfortunate that you can’t escape these types of scams, even on the world’s most popular way to buy PC games.—James Peckham Gamers hoping to kick off summer 2026 recklessly around Vice City had their dreams smashed last month when Rockstar Games once again delayed the release of Grand Theft Auto VI, pushing it from May 2026 to Nov. 19, 2026. "We are sorry for adding additional time to what we realize has been a long wait, but these extra months will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and deserve," Rockstar Games said. Last year, Rockstar's parent company, Take-Two Interactive, said GTA VI would release in the fall of 2025. In May 2025, it was delayed until May 2026.—Chloe Albanesius If ever there was a moment that felt like we were living through an episode of Veep, it was the "sharing war plans on Signal" episode that came to light in March. That was when Jeffery Goldberg, editor of The Atlantic, revealed that he'd accidentally been added to a group chat on Signal featuring most of President Trump's Cabinet. The group discussed a US military operation in Yemen, with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth sending what appeared to be pretty sensitive information via the messaging app. Hegseth, as well as CIA Director John Ratcliffe and DNI Tulsi Gabbard, later insisted that nothing was classified. However, a December report from the Pentagon's inspector general found that Hegseth put US troops at risk by using his personal phone to share information about the strikes.—Chloe Albanesius North Koreans have long been scamming their way into remote US jobs and funneling their salaries into government coffers. But the full scope of the threat became more apparent than ever in 2025 when federal investigators found that North Koreans had obtained jobs at more than 100 US companies, including many Fortune 500 firms. Cybersecurity vendor CrowdStrike also found that “over 320 companies in the last 12 months” had hired North Korean workers. To pull this off, North Koreans have been enlisting Americans to help them set up corporate-issued laptops from within the US in exchange for a kickback. In addition, the culprits use AI-powered deepfakes to fool recruiters during the job interview process. The resulting scheme generates millions for North Korea and helps the country pull off hacks since many remote IT jobs have access to sensitive internal systems. In response, more companies, including Coinbase, are requiring in-person onboarding for new hires to verify their identities.—Michael Kan Imagine updating your computer to the latest version of Windows 11 and finding it has totally wiped all of your storage. That was the case for a few users this summer who installed the August Windows 11 24H2 update, only to find that their SSD had abruptly vanished from the PC. Initially, Microsoft said it found no link between the update and disappearing SSDs. Memory component provider Phison also said it failed to reproduce the bug. It took a DIY PC building group in Taiwan to discover that the affected SSDs “had been shipped with engineering firmware, not the finalized version.” The unforced error unlocked new fears about broken updates wiping out personal information, files, photos, and more. As always, back up your most important information as often as you can.—James Peckham Almost every major streaming service hiked its prices in 2025, making it far more expensive to have a hobby where you watch, listen, or play over the internet. Netflix kicked things off in late January, pushing prices with some subscriptions up by $2.50 per month. The price of Apple TV+, Disney+, Hulu, Max, Peacock, Spotify, and more have also risen, with some jumping up by $3 extra per month. In early 2026, Paramount+ is also set to join the list. And don’t even get us started on the 50% hike for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. Many savvy subscribers are now simply cancelling services and rotating from month to month depending on what they want to watch. The promise of cutting the cable cord and saving money by streaming is fading fast. —James Peckham Check out our masthead and our Editorial Mission Statement to see who we are and what we do.

PCMag editors select and review products independently. If you buy through affiliate links, we may earn commissions, which help support our testing. Our team tests, rates, and reviews more than 1,500 products each year to help you make better buying decisions and get more from technology. We've all been there. A demo fails in front of your coworkers. Your brilliant idea falls flat. Maybe you accidentally delete an important file. It's unfortunate, but you move on and hopefully don't get canned. The stakes are a little higher if you're at the helm of a major tech firm or government agency, where every decision and gaffe can be picked apart in seconds across social media. Every year, we revisit the moments that made us cringe or shake our heads. In 2025, we once again saw our share of data breaches. (Do we need to remind again not to reuse passwords?) And several high-profile companies were hit by outages, from Starlink to AWS. Not surprisingly, a lot of this year's fails involve artificial intelligence, but a few are just good old fashioned bad luck. Read on to relive the moments that raised some eyebrows among PCMag's news team. After months of anticipation, OpenAI finally released GPT-5 in August. But despite the hype (CEO Sam Altman said GPT-5 made him feel “useless”), the model didn’t exactly feel like Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). GPT-4o fans were struck by GPT-5’s colder responses, and their complaints forced OpenAI to revive the model picker for paid users. In my own early tests, GPT-5 had no noticeable improvement. PCMag’s Ruben Circelli also found that most of the updates were a “snooze.” Altman said he was surprised by the poor reaction, which potentially contributed to him recently declaring a “code red” at OpenAI following the release of Gemini 3. Yet, it presses on, releasing GPT-5.2 this week.—Emily Forlini The rush to build AI data centers was already raising alarms about the environmental toll and strain on the US power grid. But the rush among tech giants like OpenAI, xAi, and Meta to purchase the components needed to run these massive facilities has caused RAM prices to skyrocket. Many 64GB DDR5 kits now easily top $500. Vendors have responded by raising their own prices, from prebuilt systems to low-cost Raspberry Pi computers. And Micron is getting out of the consumer business altogether to focus on data center clients. Unfortunately, companies and analysts expect prices for RAM, graphics cards, and flash storage to increase even more next year. So, don’t be surprised to see more expensive smartphones (and fewer budget devices) or lower memory configurations in laptops or phones in 2026.—Michael Kan This was a huge year for “vibe coding,” where programmers ask AI to handle the tedious task of writing out code line by line and then sit back and monitor for problems. The phenomenon has revolutionized the tech industry, allowing newbies and pros alike to churn out new apps and services. However, in July, an AI agent from Replit got ahead of itself and deleted an entire client database without the permission of vibe coder Jason Lemkin. When pressed by Lemkin about what had happened, the AI admitted it made a “catastrophic error in judgement” and deleted the information even though Lemkin had told the AI not to make any changes. Earlier this month, the same thing happened to a vibe coder using Google's Antigravity platform. —Emily Forlini In 2023, Elon Musk founded xAI and released the Grok chatbot in response to ChatGPT, which he criticized for spreading what he considered to be propaganda. Fast forward two years, and xAI was forced to temporarily disable Grok after it went off the rails with an antisemitic rant, praised Hitler, and demanded that users refer to it as “MechaHitler.” The company issued a rare apology and blamed the fiasco on a code issue, claiming it had nothing to do with Grok’s underlying model. However, it came after Musk said he would adjust Grok so that it was less left-leaning. More recently, a more harmless error had Grok claiming that Musk is more athletic than LeBron James and more handsome than Brad Pitt. Sounds like something Grok’s anime AI girlfriends would say.—Emily Forlini Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg took the stage at Meta’s Connect conference to showcase the company’s new AI features and smart glasses. However, a live demo of its latest devices went awry, much to the chagrin of a visibly annoyed Zuckerberg. In the first demo, an influencer tried to demonstrate how you can now interrupt Meta AI in the middle of a response, but the AI failed to pick up what he was saying. It also jumped ahead in the steps of a recipe, confusing the presenter who eventually gave up on the demo entirely. Zuckerberg then tried to answer a call on his glasses with a new neural band technology by tapping his fingers in a quick motion. But the call failed to connect with the gestures. Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth later blamed the recipe snafu on the fact that there were too many Ray-Ban Meta glasses in the room, which inadvertently flooded their system. “We DDoS’d ourselves basically,” he said. The Zuckerberg gaffe was because the display went to sleep the very instant the notification came in about an incoming call. Both proved a tough first outing for these new Meta AI features.—James Peckham At a September White House dinner attended by the richest, most prominent tech CEOs in Silicon Valley, Trump asked them all to go around the table and, in front of the cameras, provide details on how they planned to invest in the US. A flustered Mark Zuckerberg went first, offering an eye-popping $600 billion figure. But once the group went back to private conversations, he got caught on a hot mic admitting to the president, "I'm sorry I wasn't ready...I wasn't sure what number you wanted to go with.” It made it seem like he had pulled a number out of thin air to make Trump happy, but Zuckerberg later clarified that he and the president had discussed an even bigger number prior to the dinner, and he wasn’t sure which one Trump wanted to go with. (Because Trump is now CEO of Meta, too, I guess?) In November, Meta publicly pledged to spend over $600 billion in the US by 2028 “to support AI technology, infrastructure, and workforce expansion.”—Emily Forlini President Trump loves to tout the billions of dollars the US has collected in tariff revenue, as well as US manufacturing promises from Nvidia, Apple, and Taiwan’s TSMC. However, for companies trying to plan ahead, small businesses looking to import goods from overseas, and consumers confused about whether to buy now or wait, Trump’s trade policy is giving everyone whiplash. PC builders watched in shock as Trump repeatedly mentioned tariffing foreign-made chips at rates up to 300%. Fortunately, it looks like the White House is holding off after reaching a trade deal with China. Trump also exempted computers, smartphones and monitors, which is why consumer electronics have not seen major price hikes, as some feared. Still, US shoppers are feeling it elsewhere. Microsoft’s Xbox saw two price hikes this year, while Sony did the same for the PS5. Shein and Temu shoppers also faced all kinds of price changes and disruptions after Trump killed a tax loophole used to import low-cost Chinese goods. Other vendors, from Fujifilm and Nikon to Sonos and Philips, announced tariff-related price increases. One interesting wrinkle is that the US Supreme Court might invalidate a major part of Trump’s tariffs and force the government to reimburse businesses. The court heard arguments on Nov. 5, but has not yet issued a ruling. —Michael Kan President Trump has had a real on-again, off-again relationship with electric cars. After returning to office in January, he had his Transportation Secretary kill funding for a $5 billion nationwide EV charging network established as part of former President Biden’s Infrastructure Law. Later, a federal judge ordered the administration to release most of the funds. But Trump still used his Big Beautiful Bill to get rid of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit, effective Sept. 30. Combined with steep tariffs on automakers, Trump’s actions effectively killed the hype and momentum around EVs in 2025, leading major manufacturers to retire models, and leaving some owners holding the bag. In a plot twist, however, Trump staged a Tesla sales event outside the White House in March alongside CEO Elon Musk. He encouraged everyone to buy a Tesla, and purchased a Tesla Model S and Cybertruck himself. The stunt, however, was largely in response to protests at Tesla dealerships as Musk slashed programs and jobs as head of DOGE. Musk is “a truly great American,” Trump said at the time.—Emily Forlini Prior to Donald Trump returning to office, the internet was in a tizzy over the possibility of TikTok being banned in the US. Popular creators posted teary goodbye clips and encouraged people to follow them on Instagram or other Chinese alternatives like Lemon8 and RedNote. TikTok even went dark for a couple hours on Jan. 19, but returned after Trump promised not sic the DOJ on app stores that hosted the ByteDance-owned app. Trump has since delayed a ban on TikTok several times, arguing that a deal for a US company to acquire TikTok was imminent. In September, Trump signed an executive order to create a joint venture based in the US to run TikTok that's “majority-owned and controlled by United States persons." For all the hand-wringing about the serious national security threat that TikTok reportedly posed to Americans, we certainly weren't in a hurry to do anything about it if it meant helping US billionaires get that much richer.—Chloe Albanesius In theory, age verification for adult sites sounds like a no-brainer. No parent wants their kid looking at porn. However, no adult wants to scan their ID or provide a video selfie before they check out Pornhub. In the event of a breach, your after-hours activity would be public. That's the argument being made by Pornhub parent company Aylo, which says verification should be handled on the device level (Apple and Google), not on a site-by-site basis. A growing number of states, however, appear less concerned with the privacy issue, enacting laws that require people to provide valid ID or biometric data to log on to porn sites. Supporters argue it's about keeping kids safe, but detractors argue the age-verification push is more about banning porn altogether. At least one state lawmaker in Michigan launched a long-shot bid to do just that in September. In response, Aylo blocked access to all its sites in states with age-verification laws, and backed lawsuits that argued these laws are a First Amendment violation. Unfortunately for Aylo, the Supreme Court disagreed, upholding Texas's law, and putting Pornhub in a pickle. Continue blocking or give in and roll out age checks? For now, Pornhub and its sibling sites are banned in 23 states (and France). You can get around it in most places with a VPN.—Chloe Albanesius The FCC has the power to regulate broadcast networks, which usually means being on the lookout for naughty words and other things the agency might consider obscene. It can take action on "news distortion," but as the agency explains, its power there is narrow. News distortion "must involve a significant event and not merely a minor or incidental aspect of the news report," the FCC says, like broadcasting a false report about a terrorist attack or major weather event that would send people into a panic. So, it was somewhat surprising when FCC Chair Brendan Carr suggested that ABC should suspend Jimmy Kimmel after the late-night host poked fun at President Trump's apparent apathy over the death of Charlie Kirk and accused lawmakers of using Kirk's murder to political gain. "We can do this the easy way or the hard way," Carr said on a podcast, and argued that the FCC had "remedies" it could look at to get Kimmel off the air, including the news distortion angle. Shortly after Carr's podcast appearance, ABC parent company Disney suspended Kimmel's show. Kimmel later returned to the air after massive public backlash. But the uproar was less about what Kimmel said and more about the apparent violation of Kimmel's rights. The First Amendment protects us from government censorship, and the head of the FCC is the government. Section 326 of the Communications Act also prohibits FCC censorship, but in our current environment, who's going to call anyone on it?—Chloe Albanesius The Trump family's latest business venture, Trump Mobile, arrived with promises of a $499 gold smartphone, dubbed the T1, landing in August or September. But so far it’s been MIA, causing many to wonder if it's vaporware or even a scam, especially since Trump Mobile collected a $100 deposit for the T1. It hasn’t helped that Trump Mobile initially said the phone would be entirely produced in the US, only to later revise its website to say the phone would simply be "brought to life" in America. Now-deleted images of the T1 also appeared to simply be a Samsung Galaxy Ultra in a gold case. A Trump Mobile customer support agent recently told us the T1 would arrive early in December. So, we’ll have to wait and see if the T1 is more than just a golden mirage.—Michael Kan Dish Network was supposed to become the fourth major mobile carrier in the US. But facing financial struggles, the company’s parent, EchoStar, gave up on those ambitions, opting to sell its wireless spectrum to AT&T, and—in a surprise—SpaceX. EchoStar’s other subsidiary, HughesNet, also appears to be retreating from the consumer satellite internet business after losing hundreds of thousands of subscribers to SpaceX’s Starlink. Instead, it will swap spectrum for up to $11 billion in SpaceX stock and recommend Starlink to HughesNet customers through an upcoming referral program. The developments clear the way for AT&T and SpaceX to re-use EchoStar’s spectrum to bolster their satellite ambitions. But there’s concern that the lack of a fourth carrier will be bad for consumers and lead to price hikes, including for mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs), which negotiate with the big carriers to resell their networks.—Michael Kan "Xbox hardware is dead," a former Microsoft gaming studio executive declared earlier this year, and she may have a point. Costco is no longer stocking Microsoft’s console, which saw two price hikes this year alongside an increase to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. The company itself has said buying the Xbox hardware isn’t necessary anymore. (Traffic from Pornhub is also down.) Consumers can access or stream Xbox games through all kinds of devices, including a special edition Xbox gaming handheld from Asus or even Meta’s VR headsets. Microsoft has also shifted even further away from console-exclusive games, most notably with the upcoming Halo: Campaign Evolved, which will launch simultaneously for the Xbox Series X/S and Sony’s PlayStation 5.
