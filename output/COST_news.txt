Ed Stack stands with his arms crossed, surveying the wall of colorful basketball shoes near the entrance of Dick’s Sporting Goods’ House of Sport in Pittsburgh’s Ross Park Mall. The vast selection of around 2,400 pairs of Nike Air Jordans, Under Armour Currys and more — known as the “Footwear Deck” — is a key part of Dick’s’ strategy to stand out in the digital age. A separate soccer-skewed section, House of Cleats, downstairs has at least 300 other pairs. “People really want to feel it, touch it, try it on,” and experience it, explains Stack, 69, Dick’s’ executive chairman. That’s why there’s also a 31.5-foot indoor climbing wall visible directly over Stack’s shoulder, nearby batting cages, golf bays, and even a 18,000 square foot outdoor sports field for customers to use. Plus there are technicians on hand to restring racquets, lace baseball gloves and sharpen ice skates. Aaron Kotowski for Forbes These bells and whistles are features of a new jumbo store format that Dick’s is opening across the country. The House of Sport is double to triple the size of a regular 50,000 square foot location. The Pittsburgh mega-store, the closest one to Dick’s’ corporate headquarters–where Forbes interviewed Stack in November–opened in April in a long abandoned Sears; it’s the third largest Dick’s location to date at 140,000 square feet. The biggest, at nearly 150,000 square feet, is in Salem, New Hampshire, plus there are 15 more of these behemoth complexes already open with plans to retrofit up to 100 of its 725 U.S. locations by 2027. (Dick’s has another 136 “specialty stores,” including Golf Galaxy and outdoor chain Public Lands.) Forbes estimates the retailer will spend nearly $2 billion on this expansion. Dick’s is doubling down on brick-and-mortar at a time when many retailers are downsizing or shuttering locations - more than 6,480 stores in the U.S. closed this year, the highest number since 2020, according to data from Coresight research. It’s just the latest gamble from Stack, who has spent four decades obsessing about ways to beat competitors; he bought the company from his father, the original founder, in 1984. “I was always an athlete, a mediocre athlete but I loved the competition,” he says, sipping a glass bottle of Coca-Cola. (The only sport he plays these days is golf.) “Ed is always pushing himself to be better, his company to be better, his team to be better and his partners to be better,” says Nike’s CEO Elliott Hill, describing him as “courageous and competitive.” He’s known Stack for 20 years; Nike is a key partner of Dick’s, accounting for about 24% of its $13 billion in 2023 sales. Stack instilled this mindset in his management team, too. “We’re constantly looking around corners. And we joke, we say it's not a joke, but we have what we call productive paranoia,” says Lauren Hobart, Dick’s CEO since 2021. “But that's actually the root of a lot of our success. We don't take a lot of time looking backward or resting on our laurels.” “Ed Stack is a genius who inherited a mom and pop sporting goods store and turned it into a national retail powerhouse,” says Phil Knight, founder of Nike, which sold about $3 billion of its branded product at Dick’s last year. It’s been a winning formula. Dick’s, which has already outlived a number of now-defunct rivals like Sports Authority, Herman’s and Modell’s, is one of just a handful of retailers to record consistent same-store sales growth since the Covid-19 pandemic, according to Morgan Stanley equity analyst Simeon Gutman. (Others include Walmart, Costco and O’Reilly Auto Parts.) Revenue is expected to hit a record of up to $13.3 billion this year, up from $8.8 billion in 2019, a more than 50% jump. And the stock is up nearly 800% in that same time, including 60% in the past year. Stack, who has not sold a single share of his voting stock since taking the company public in 2002 and remains the biggest individual shareholder, is now worth $5.4 billion. Business didn’t look so good back in 2018. Sales were stagnating as it fought for relevance against online retailers like Amazon and Walmart and began phasing guns out of their stores. It also took a hit as some of its brands began selling directly to consumers or, in Under Armour’s case, distributing to lower-priced stores like Kohl’s. Stack quickly took action. “The brief I gave everybody was we need to sit down and we need to design the concept that will kill Dick’s Sporting Goods,” Stack, dressed in a plaid navy suit, explains from a conference room hidden behind a set of large, wooden doors in the back of the Pittsburgh store. “If someone opened the store that we’re going to design across the street from us, we’d be out of business, we wouldn't survive.” Covid was a boon for Dick’s as outdoor sports like golf, running and kayaking exploded in popularity; at one point in 2020, Dick’s sold out of kayaks in nearly 500 of its locations. But it wasn’t just luck. After closing all its stores in March that year, it took just two days for Dick’s to open for curbside pickup, a feat that was only possible due to an earlier overhaul of its ecommerce site that brought the technology in-house. This hybrid model of buying online and picking up in-person has proven deeply popular with customers. “It’s the convenience,” explains Hobart. “If you’re running to your kid’s game and realize you don’t have a cleat, you know the size is in stock and that you can quickly get to the field.” Shoppers also like knowing ahead of time that what they want is in stock. The company has five distribution centers but today more than 90% of sales are fulfilled by the stores, yet another factor fueling the House of Sport push: more square footage can house more inventory for better delivery times. “There’s no other retailer that I cover that’s had a turnaround like Dick’s has,” says Morningstar analyst David Swartz. Says Stack, about the recent changes: “We do virtually nothing the same.” This isn’t the first time Ed Stack has reinvented his family business. He was 13 when he started working for his father at the original Dick’s, then called Dick’s Bait and Tackle. The elder Stack had started the business as a teen in 1948 as a modest bait-and-tackle supplier in Binghamton, New York. Ed spent his summers, vacations and Christmases in the about 600-square-foot store, unloading merchandise from trucks and attaching price tags. The eldest of five children, Ed was expected to work at the store full-time after graduating high school. But there was one problem: “I hated every minute,” he recalls. Richard "Dick" Stack (left) and Ed Stack (right). The pair didn't always see eye to eye, which is what led dad to sell out to son. Ed and Dick had a strained relationship. Stack has attributed this to his father’s short temper. (Even so, there is a framed picture of Dick Stack in every Dick’s location.) In 1973, Ed, an admittedly subpar student, left home for St. John Fisher University in Rochester, New York, with the dream of becoming a lawyer. He dropped those plans when his father’s heart temporarily stopped following a double bypass surgery from which he never fully recovered. Ed returned home to join the business after graduation in 1977. His dad’s tackle shop was not the Stack family’s first entrepreneurial venture. His grandfather was a bootlegger during prohibition before dying in a car crash in 1935. This time was different: Ed fell in love with retail, though he continued to clash with his father, who lived for two more decades. The younger Stack wanted to expand, while his dad, who nearly went bankrupt after opening a second location in 1953, didn’t want to take any risks. Seven years in, things reached a breaking point. “My dad was a pretty colorful guy and he looked at me and said, ‘You think you’re such a smart S.O.B., go down to the bank, get your own line of credit and buy me out. So that’s what I did,” recalls Stack, who along with his four siblings bought their father’s two stores in Binghamton. They agreed in 1984 to pay the older Stack $1.25 million over 20 years at a 12% annual interest rate plus the price of leasing his two stores for 25 years–Dick’s terms. They paid the rest of the sum out to their stepmother following Dick’s death in 1998 after a battle with dementia caused by his cardio vascular problems. (Ed’s siblings have not been involved with the business in decades, and none own over 5%.) Finally in charge, Ed got to work expanding Dick’s’ inventory beyond hunting and fishing gear. He forged relationships with brands like Nike (around 1978) and Adidas (1980). When it came to Dick’s’ brick-and-mortar growth, Stack studied Walmart founder Sam Walton and mimicked his idea of opening stores in “concentric circles” around the company’s launch point (in Dick’s’ case: Binghamton). Stack drove around small or medium-sized cities counting the number of swing sets in people’s yards; he also looked at the popularity of youth sports leagues, the number of colleges nearby, and the weather–after discovering that his offerings sold better in colder climates. Soon there were stores in Syracuse, New York; Hartford, Connecticut and Erie, Pennsylvania. Around this time, he brought in the company’s first outside investors: venture capitalists Michael Barach of Bessemer Venture Partners, Jerry Gallagher of Oak Investment Partners and Janet Hickey of Scout Group, as well as Denis Defforey, a cofounder of French supermarket chain Carrefour and an early advisor of Dick’s, who together infused more than $16 million. In 2014, Stack sued Mitch Modell, the CEO of now-defunct rival Modell’s Sporting Goods who he accused of using a disguise to spy on Dick’s. They settled for $1 on the condition that Modell would never do it again. The rapid expansion soon backfired. “I joined in March [of 1995] and realized by August we were going to run out of cash,” recalls Mike Hines, Dick’s’ chief financial officer for 12 years until 2007. “I was pissed.” A key problem: the new stores were too big. “We did the calculations and the size of the store that was most effective was 50,000 square feet,” says Hines. The stores they were building were up to 70,000 square feet. Dick’s dug itself out of the hole by securing a $140 million loan from GE Capital, contingent on the existing investors putting up more capital. They did – to the tune of $35 million – resulting in Stack losing majority control of his family business. Dick’s halted new store openings for 18 months, and focused on monitoring inventory and margins. By 1997, the company had largely bounced back from the crisis. Three years later, Stack borrowed another $60 million from GE Capital, this time to buy out his investors. Over the next two years, Dick’s hit $1 billion sales and then Stack took the company public, vowing to maintain majority voting control over the company always. Another crucial moment for Dick’s came in after a 19-year-old former high school student shot and killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida on Valentine’s Day 2018. Two weeks later, Stack announced he was banning the sale of all assault rifles and guns to anyone under the age of 21. “What happened in Parkland had a really profound impact on me,” says the billionaire, who later flew to Florida to meet with the families of victims. “I’m not much of a crier… I hadn’t cried that much since my mother passed away,” he says, “It got to a point where I said, ‘I don't want to be a part of this story any longer.’” "What we’ve always been concerned about is that we wake up one day and have a tired old chain." Dick’s destroyed the $5 million worth of semi-automatic rifles left in its inventory. The guns were sawed into pieces and turned into scrap metal, prompting outrage from the trade association National Shooting Sports Foundation and the National Rifle Association. “What a waste, and what a strange business model,” the NRA tweeted at the time. Dick’s predicted dropping these guns would cost the company at least a quarter of a billion in revenue, or 3.5% of its overall sales at the time. The business did take a hit but it turned out to be a “great move,” says Stack. Soon after the shooting, Dick’s experimented with removing entire gun displays in 10 of its stores and replacing them with growing categories like footwear and apparel, and products popular in that specific region: fishing gear in Florida and outerwear in Boston, for example. Because the profit margin on hunting equipment was 17% lower on average than the rest of the store, these locations had to recapture just 60% of lost sales to break even. “We captured a little more than 100%,” says Stack. Nowadays no guns are sold at any Dick’s stores. (In January 2024, the company sold the retail naming rights of its hunting subsidiary, Field & Stream, to country singers Morgan Wallen and Eric Church.) The retailer’s gross profit margins have increased to 35% in 2023 from 29% in 2017, in part because of its increased emphasis on higher margin categories like clothing and shoes, which now make up 59% of Dick’s’ business, versus 54% in 2017. Stack didn’t advertise it at the time, but there was another big change in the aftermath of the Parkland shooting. The self-described “political junkie” decided in 2019 to quietly test the waters as an independent presidential candidate ahead of the 2020 race; it was at this point that Stack began “the succession planning process,” stepping down as CEO the next year. The longtime GOP donor cited extremism in both political parties as a key reason. “It’s really difficult to govern the country from as far right as we are [and] as far left as we are,” he explains. Stack, who believes the nation’s issues of education inequality and income inequality are deeply intertwined, spent less than $50,000 on the political run and said he dropped the plan after around 18 months, following an “intervention” by his friends and family. Says Stack, who hasn’t donated to any presidential candidates in the last two elections. “I have no political aspirations any longer.” Building bigger boxes nearly killed Dick’s 30 years ago. But Stack is convinced times are different now. Plus he’s taking a different tack. Instead of opening a flurry of new, larger stores, House of Sport focuses on redeveloping Dick’s’ existing fleet of stores. (This is helped by the fact that around of the company’s existing leases are up for renegotiation in the next three years). He also learned to take his time. Stack and his team spent years experimenting with different concepts in the 25,000 square foot “Lab Store” in Dick’s’ Pittsburgh HQ. It took until 2021 for the company to settle on a design it felt was different enough from Dick’s’ existing model. Since then they’ve opened an average of around four new stores every year. It’s also upgrading dozens more of its traditional 50,000 square foot stores with House of Sport fixtures like the Footwear Deck and House of Cleats. Though early, the results are encouraging. Each House of Sport was generating five to six times the amount of traffic of a traditional Dick’s, according to a March analysis from the retail data tracking platform Placer.ai. The company predicts it will take less than three years to recoup the roughly $18.5 million net investment it takes to build and stock each House of Sport. Landlords and vendors are also on board. “They’re creating a theater for their customers and an environment in which more of these vendors want the proper placement,” says Morgan Stanley analyst Gutman. "They went from Dick's needing the vendors more ... and now the entire relationship is flipped." While most House of Sport features are free for customers to use, the rock wall costs $15 per climb. Parts of the new stores can be rented out for birthday parties. Moving forward, Dick’s could have a rocky road ahead with Donald Trump in the White House. The president-elect has said he will move to impose unprecedented tariffs on his first day in office. He’s floated various figures including a 25% tariff penalty on all goods imported from Canada and Mexico and an additional 10% on Chinese imports. Experts have predicted this will take a heavy toll on retailers who rely on imported materials. Dick’s’ challenge stems from the fact that around 87% of its revenue comes from selling other brands, whose supply chains it does not control. Hobart says Dick’s has been talking with its brand partners and “running scenarios” about what tariffs could mean for the company and its customers. She says her “hope” is that shoppers won’t be too affected if tariffs are indeed implemented. A big reason is that many of Dick’s’ suppliers were already forced to move away from Chinese imports during the pandemic. “I do think one of the important things is that the entire industry has been working on diversifying supply. It’s a requirement,” says Hobart. “So that’s a good thing. We’ve got supply coming in from multiple countries at this point.” Still, Dick’s’ future plans involve growing the parts of the business that it more directly controls. This includes its in-house brands like DSG and Calia (made in South East Asia); the latter was a partnership with country singer Carrie Underwood launched in 2015 that is now Dick’s’ top selling women’s brand after Nike (Underwood is no longer involved). These private label brands, which also boast higher margins, accounted for around 13% of revenue, or $1.6 billion, last year. It also now has a place where it can unload unsold inventory. Going, Going, Gone! is its three-year-old off-price store concept where customers can shop for bargains at one of its 20 permanent stores and 30 temporary locations so far. Yet another way the company is looking to add revenue is by creating a “retail media network” in which it uses consumer data collected from its loyalty program (accounting for 70% of revenue) and its Gamechanger app to do paid advertising for its partners. For example, if one of their partners wanted to better advertise to people beginning to train for a marathon, Dick’s will target those specific shoppers with ads. For Stack, who has now spent nearly 60 years working on Dick’s, these ongoing changes are par for the course. “One thing that always amazed me about Ed was that he’s a sponge for information. He is never married to an idea or a philosophy,” says Bill Colombo, the vice chair of Dick’s’ board who met Stack when they were put in the same dorm at St. John Fisher. “What we’ve always been concerned about is that we wake up one day and have a tired old chain,” says Stack. “We’ve seen so many retailers that … never really evolved and innovated their business. And a number of those retailers are gone today. We want to make sure that doesn’t happen to us.”

Title: The Best Places To Buy Contacts Online, According To A Lens-Wearer

As a contact lens-wearer for nearly two decades, I’ve learned that purchasing contacts online is both cheaper and more convenient than buying them at the optometrist’s office. Having purchased from 1-800 Contacts for a number of years, I named this retailer the best place to buy contacts online due to its incredible return policy (return any unused contacts, any time), Best Price Guarantee and friendly, accessible customer service. But, there are other contacts e-tailers deserving of accolades for their own reasons, like Hubble, my choice for a subscription-based service, and Warby Parker, ideal for lens-wearers who also d0n the company’s stylish frames. I consider 1-800 Contacts to be the best place to buy contacts overall thanks to its variety, Best ... [+] Price Guarantee and ridiculously generous return policy. When making a contacts purchase online, you’ll need a current prescription at the ready. Most sites let you upload a scan of your prescription then plug in your eye doctor information to be verified. While you cannot use an expired prescription to make a purchase as per the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)—and prescriptions are only good for one or two years, but it varies by state—many sites offer virtual exams for prescription renewals. Some of my favorite places to order contacts online offer this option, but I also evaluated e-tailers for variety, pricing, shipping and return policies, and whether they accept insurance and HSA or FSA funds. Below, see my top picks and how they fit your contacts-buying needs. 1-800 Contacts Shipping: Free standard shipping, plus expedited and one-day options | Return policy: Free returns and exchanges any time, including opened boxes | Insurance accepted: Yes, and accepts FSA and HSA | Virtual Rx renewal: Yes What you’ll love: Keep in mind: I’ve remained a 1-800-contacts customer for years because, second to purchasing from a reputable site, my priority is price. The company’s Best Price Guarantee offers assurance that you’ll score your lenses for the lowest market price; just contact customer service via the 24/7 live chat and show them a link to the same lower-priced product for verification. The process is relatively easy, save for a few qualifying factors—for instance, the competitor must be U.S.-based, and searching for an eligible price match can get time-consuming. (I explain more thoroughly in my full 1-800-Contacts review if you want to know more). So, if you want the lowest cost for your lenses up front without doing any legwork, this may not be the best retailer for you. Other features that earn the company top marks include its ExpressExam, a virtual prescription renewal that costs $20, its fast free shipping and its generous return policy: You can return unused contacts at any time (somehow, I always have more dailies left for my right eye…)—even if you purchased them from another retailer. And, if you need specs, you can shop frames from its house brand, Liingo. Ultimately, 1-800-Contacts has earned its reputation for stellar and accessible customer service, and in my experience, I’ve always found its reps to be accommodating, helpful and incredibly friendly. Hubble Shipping: $4 standard shipping (plus any applicable sales tax) | Return policy: Return unopened boxes within 14 days for a refund, less shipping and handling | Insurance accepted: No, but accepts HSA and FSA | Virtual Rx renewal: Yes, free for subscribers What you’ll love: Keep in mind: It’s no secret that contact lenses are expensive, and Hubble’s monthly subscription model helps lessen up-front costs while keeping you stocked up. If you’re not stuck on a brand and want the most bang for your buck, check out Hubble’s line of lenses, which range from $23 to $30 per month, per eye. They include Hubble, the namesake line that features affordable dailies; Hydro for extra dry eyes; and SkyHy, the most breathable option. If you’re considering switching brands, though, the FTC states you may need a new prescription unless it’s “a generic or store brand version of the same lens” recommended by your doc. Hubble also has offerings from Acuvue, Bausch + Lomb and Biotrue, but that’s the extent of its third-party offerings. For hesitant first-timer subscribers, the e-tailer’s initial promos are hard to beat, starting as low as $1 per eye for the Hubble Classic Daily 10-day starter pack—shipping included. Another boon is its virtual vision tests for prescription renewals, which is free for subscribers. While many well-known online contacts lens retailers offer auto-ship or subscription options, Hubble’s biggest defining factor is its overall cost friendliness, if you don’t mind the lack of brand variety. Just keep in mind that each order costs $4 in shipping, plus any additional taxes, if applicable. GlassesUSA Shipping: Free standard shipping, plus expedited and express options | Return policy: Free returns and exchanges of unopened boxes within 60 days | Insurance accepted: Yes, and accepts FSA and HSA | Virtual Rx renewal: No What you’ll love: Keep in mind: As far as variety and a straightforward user experience, GlassesUSA is a well-known eyewear retailer and one-stop shop for glasses, sunglasses and of course, contact lenses. Further, it offers a multitude of options in each category. When shopping for contacts, you can easily search by brand, lens type, prescription type (single-vision, multifocal, astigmatism, etc.), budget and more, and there’s an Auto-Refill option at checkout. The company also accepts insurance, and while its Price Match Guarantee isn’t as outwardly advertised as others, it will honor lower competitor pricing (and reimburse you the difference if it’s within three days of your purchase). One thing the site lacks, though, is a virtual prescription renewal feature. This is a great place to shop if you’re big into browsing sales and coupons; the site is transparent with discounts and has an easy-to-find sale section and coupon page. And because GlassesUSA specializes in, well, glasses, you can take advantage of promotions across different types of eyewear, like free glasses worth up to $150 with your first shipment of contacts. Contacts Direct Shipping: Free standard shipping and store pickup at LensCrafters, plus priority and express options | Return policy: Return unopened boxes within 6 months for a refund, less shipping charges | Insurance accepted: Yes, and accepts HSA and FSA | Virtual Rx renewal: Yes What you’ll love: Keep in mind: While many other contact lens retailers accept insurance, and more frequently HSA and FSA funds, ContactsDirect makes cashing in on these benefits especially easy. The company’s insurance policy page outlines accepted carriers as well as info on out-of-network vision plans, and you can speak with customer service reps via live chat or phone if you need help or have questions. Plus, savings is not exclusive to insurance holders: Visit its savings page for info on promos, including 15% off all orders with code MYCONTACTS plus a standard 15% off for military members, teachers, government workers, first responders, and hospital and medical workers. ContactsDirect also does price matching, but only with a select list of competitors (including Walgreens and Costco). Selection-wise, this site offers all the major brands and varieties, including specialty lenses like multifocals or those for astigmatism. You can also get your prescription renewed online for $19—which is $10 off—with code VISION10. Contact Lens King Shipping: $10 to $13 for standard US shipping, plus priority and expedited options | Return policy: Return unopened boxes within 30 days for a refund, less shipping charges | Insurance accepted: No, but accepts HSA and FSA | Virtual Rx renewal: No What you’ll love: Keep in mind: Before you get too excited about Contact Lens King’s low pricing, it’s important to note that shipping is quite steep at $10 to $13 for standard domestic shipping. So if you’re only ordering, say, two to four boxes of lenses and break down the cost, you’re probably not be saving much. (Yes, I’ve done that math.) However, if you typically order a larger supply of six-plus boxes, the savings adds up. And while you may see lower cost-per-box options on other sites, beware of excessive hidden fees that are tacked on in cart. Otherwise, Contact Lens King offers a pretty standard experience when it comes to shopping for contacts online, including ample brand and lens variety (with options for astigmatism and colored contacts), the acceptance of HSA and FSA funds (but not insurance) and accessible help via phone or live chat. You won’t find extra features like virtual prescription renewals here, but you will find transparent pricing that will save you cash if you buy in bulk. Warby Parker Shipping: Free standard shipping, plus expedited option | Return policy: Free returns and exchanges of unopened boxes within 60 days of receipt| Insurance accepted: Yes, and accepts HSA and FSA | Virtual Rx renewal: Yes What you’ll love: Keep in mind: Warby Parker’s claim to fame is its affordable line of stylish frames that start at $95. It’s also known for its Home Try-On program that lets you test five pairs for free before making your purchase. Now, it also offers a large selection of contact lenses including its value house brand called Scout, which you can sample at no cost. While the company offers convenient and cost-saving perks like competitive pricing, free shipping and virtual prescription renewals, and it accepts insurance, HSA and FSA funds, these incentives aren’t necessarily unique. But for fans of Warby Parker’s frames—especially frequent buyers, or those who alternate regularly between glasses and lenses—you can get all your eyewear and have your prescription info saved at a single destination. (Don’t forget, the brand offers a line of sunglasses, too.) Further, you can take advantage of cross-product savings like a $50 eyewear credit when you buy an annual supply of contacts. Walgreens Shipping: Free standard shipping on contact lens-only orders, plus overnight option | Return policy: Returns accepted in unopened boxes, with some exceptions | Insurance accepted: No, but accepts HSA and FSA | Virtual Rx renewal: No What you’ll love: Keep in mind: Unlike shopping through an eyewear site, Walgreens doesn’t offer vision-specific features like a virtual try-on option or extra-lenient return policy. However, making a purchase through the drugstore giant means competitive pricing and promos, a “ship to store option” and the ability to throw additional essentials into your cart. (And it’s especially convenient if you regularly shop on the Walgreens site, anyway.) Shipping is free on contact lens-only orders, and if you’re getting a mix of items, it’s free on purchases over $35. In the virtual contact lens “aisle,” you’ll find a wide selection at competitive prices, plus you can take advantage of stacked-on savings—right now, all contact lens orders are an extra 25% off with code CYBER25. The limited return policy allows you to return unopened boxes by mail if the order was incorrect, the product is defective or damaged, or you ordered the wrong prescription, and the lenses must still be in stock and unexpired. You can also use HSA and FSA funds to pay for your order. At Forbes Vetted, we’ve researched, tested and written a wide catalog of eyewear stories and roundups of the best personal care products on the market. The editors involved in writing, researching and editing this piece are contact lens-wearers and know what to look for when choosing an e-tailer for eyewear needs. As I compared popular retailers, I investigated inventory variety, shipping and return policies, and insurance and HSA and FSA eligibility. I also factored in virtual prescription renewals and customer service helpfulness, which contribute to the overall shopping experience. Shopping for contacts online is often more convenient and cost-effective than buying them at the optometrist’s office. That said, additional steps like uploading your prescription and shopping around for the best price can take some time. Here are the top things to consider when narrowing down contact lens e-tailers. If you’re already committed to a specific product, first make sure the retailer you’re considering has it in stock. This is especially true for specialty lenses, like those designed for astigmatism. If you’re not stuck on a particular brand, some eyewear companies offer value brand lenses; check out Aquasoft Dailies at 1-800 Contacts, Scout by Warby Parker and Hubble’s line of lenses. Just note, you may need a new prescription to switch brands, according to the FTC website. However, “You don’t need your prescriber’s approval to switch brands if a manufacturer offers a brand name and a generic or store brand version of the same lens,” it says. A big differentiating factor between many of our top contenders is the shopping experience, and each retailer caters to different needs. Consider whether you want the option to renew your prescription online, buy glasses and contacts in the same place, order (and save) in bulk, or receive a monthly delivery by subscription; we’ve included e-tailers that offer these conveniences and more. While many retailers offer free shipping, some still charge, so you’ll want to factor that into the overall price of your order. Hubble’s monthly subscription orders come with a $4 ship fee, but the model is helpful for those who don’t want to purchase a bunch of contacts up front; Contact Lens King’s ship fees are on the higher side starting at $10 to $13, but its low cost-per-box prices offer savings on larger orders. You want to be mindful of return policies as well, noting eligibility for return timeframes as well as product condition (for example, most e-tailers only accept returns of unopened boxes in original packaging). Further, some companies won’t reimburse you for shipping costs. If you prioritize a generous return policy, 1-800 Contacts has no time limit for returns, and you can send back any unused contacts, even if you’ve opened the box. You’ll find that pricing differs from one retailer to the next, but buyer beware: If you see a product with exceptionally low pricing, there’s a good chance that hidden fees, like excessive “processing” fees, will be added in cart, or the after-rebate price is being advertised (meaning you have to pay the full amount up front). E-tailers with price match guarantees like 1-800 Contacts, ContactsDirect and GlassesUSA give you added peace of mind if you find a lower price elsewhere. Plus, you can often take advantage of promotions for more savings at checkout. Buying your contacts online is just as safe as buying them in person, as long as you purchase from a reputable seller. All of our recommended websites feature the same brands of contacts that you’d find at an optical shop, including Acuvue and Bausch & Lomb. The main difference is that contacts purchased online are often less expensive than ones bought in a store. While your eye doctor’s office can offer rebate options, online contacts suppliers get lenses directly from manufacturers, skipping steps that add extra costs for you. Plus, they have access to massive warehouses, which allows them to give steeper discounts than you’d find at the doctor’s office. Further, several eyewear e-tailers offer price matching, meaning if you find your preferred contacts cheaper elsewhere, they’ll match (or beat) that price. This is the reason many people prefer buying contacts online—in addition to the convenience factor. No, you need to have a valid, current prescription from an eye doctor to purchase contacts online, as per the Federal Trade Commission. It also explains that prescription length varies by state, but is usually one to two years. If your prescription has expired and setting up an optometrist appointment is too much of a hassle, certain retailers allow you to renew your prescription from home with a virtual vision test. For example, 1-800 Contacts offers an ExpressExam feature that costs $20 and takes about 10 minutes to complete.
