When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. Cyber Monday is here, and there are lots of deals to choose from, including these excellent discounts on the Apple products we recommend: Today’s best Apple deals: U.S. Today’s best Apple deals: U.K. Updated December 1: We have reviewed the best prices and found more price drops and changes. We will be regularly monitoring the best prices and will update this article throughout Cyber Monday. ‘Tis the season for savings! Whether you’re looking for a deal on an iPad, Mac, iPhone, Apple Watch, AirPods, or anything else Apple sells, there’s no better time to get one for cheap than Black Friday. The annual shopping extravaganza officially kicked off on Friday, but many of the best deals will last until today, AKA Cyber Monday on December 1. Every retailer that sells Apple gear gets in on the fun, and we are rounding up only the best deals we find right here. We regularly check prices using various tools to get a view of the very best prices right now, compared to what they were over the past days, weeks, and months, so we know an excellent deal when we see it. We’re checking and updating these prices all weekend, so mark this page and return often so you don’t miss a good deal, some of which are short-lived. Even Apple runs its own Black Friday shopping event, where it offers gift cards on certain purchases, including $50 with AirPods Pro 3, $100 for iPad Air, and $250 with a MacBook Pro. The bottom line is that there are lots of deals to be found right now, so no matter what Apple device you’re looking for, you will be able to make a saving. So take a look at the deals on all of Apple’s products below. Also, check our Best Picks round-ups, where you can find reviews of all the products we recommend. At Macworld we’ve been covering and reviewing Apple and Apple devices for more than 40 years, from the original Macintosh to the most recent M5 MacBook Pro and iPhone 17 lineup. We use Apple products every day and purchase them with our own money, so we know a good deal when we see one. More importantly, we also know how to spot a bad deal. With a working knowledge of everything Apple sells and decades of experience, we know when stores are inflating prices or pushing “normal” sales as limited Black Friday deals, so the listings you see here will only be for discounts that are at or near all-time low prices. Macworld Cyber Monday tip: While shopping during the Black Friday sales, we’ve noticed that on Amazon, if you delay your delivery date, there are additional 2-3% savings to be had. This doesn’t apply to every Apple product, unfortunately, but we have seen the additional 3% applied to AirTags, and if you have lots of other eligible products in your shopping cart, then it can add up to decent savings. Apple released the new M5 MacBook Pro in October, but still sells M4 Pro and M4 Max models as well as the M4 MacBook Air. The new M5 model is mostly a chip refresh, but it’s a great one, as we said in our 4.5-star review, and right now you can get $250 off all the 14-inch M5 MacBook Pro at Amazon, taking it $50 lower than last Thursday and down to the lowest price we have seen. However, even though the new model brings a major boost in GPU and SSD performance, we also loved the M4 model, and you can get an amazing $300 off the M4 MacBook Pro at Amazon. There are also some excellent deals on the even more powerful MacBook Pro M4 Pro and M4 Max, which are full on workstations now at amazingly low prices, such as $300 off the 14-inch M4 Pro MacBook Pro at Amazon, and a whopping $500 off the 16-inch M4 Max MacBook Pro, also at Amazon. You can find more deals below. And, of course, the MacBook Air is a fantastic option for just about anyone, earning an extremely rare 5-star score in our testing. You can get $250 off the MacBook Air at Amazon. U.K. shoppers don’t miss out either, with £184 off a 13-inch MacBook Air at Amazon. £200 off the M5 MacBook Pro at KRCS, and £349 off the M4 Pro MacBook Pro at Amazon. See even more great deals below. Foundry U.S. U.K. The iMac and Mac mini received an M4 update in October 2024, with the Mac mini also getting a dramatic redesign that shrunk the case down to just 5 inches. We loved the new Mac mini design and M4 chip and there is $120 off at Amazon. The Mac mini M4 Pro version is a great low-cost way to get a really powerful Mac, and with $150 off it’s a good saving (but it was $200 earlier in the Black Friday sale). We don’t know when they will be getting M5 chips, but if they are, they won’t arrive until 2026, so we recommend picking up one of these deals if you’re looking for a Mac desktop. U.K. users should take advantage of £100 off the Mac mini, and £130 off the Mac mini pro. Simon Jary / Foundry U.S. U.K. Apple released the AirPods Pro 3 in September 2025, with a slightly new design, foam-infused eartips, and a heart-rate sensor. We gave them a near-perfect score in our review, but also noted that it’s a relatively small upgrade over the AirPods Pro 2, which has the same H2 chip and many similar features. The new model has the same $249 MSRP in the U.S. and a slightly lower £219 RRP in the U.K. (AirPods Pro 2 were £229), so keep that in mind when shopping. We don’t expect to see AirPods Pro 3 with more than $30-$50 off, but the older AirPods Pro 2 did dip as low as $139 at Walmart, but that deal seems to have ended now, the next best option is $189 on Amazon. The AirPods 4 have been out for over a year, but are still a fantastic pair of earbuds. The Black Friday deals of $69 for AirPods 4 was superb, but stock seems to have run out now (check to see if the model is user). You can still get AirPods 4 with active noise cancellation for less than $100, which is an excellent deal. If you need a pair, grab one, just beware that AirPods deals sell out quickly, but do keep checking because stock seems to come and go. See more U.S. AirPods deals below. U.K. readers can save money on the AirPods Pro 2, currently at £169 with Argos, but we’ve also seen them at that price on Amazon (but they go out of stock quickly!). Right now you can also get £20 off the AirPods 4, bringing the price under £100. See more U.K. AirPods deals below. Petter Ahrnstedt U.S. U.K. Mike Sawh Apple launched the Apple Watch Series 11 in September, but there aren’t many exclusive new features beyond better battery life and 5G networking. The two new health features, hypertension alerts and Sleep Score, are also available on the Series 10, and there isn’t a new color this year. As we noted in our review, we don’t think Series 9 or 10 users need to upgrade. We are seeing savings of $60 on the Series 11, which is a great price for such a full-featured watch, but with $150 off the Series 10 you might want to consider that, you won’t miss out on much (See our comparison of every Apple Watch). The sleeper hit of the new Apple Watch lineup is the SE 3, which got the biggest update of all three models, gaining an always-on display, temperature sensor, a faster chip, on-device Siri, and fast charging. We gave it a near-perfect score of 4.5 stars and highly recommend it at full price—for $50 off, it’s a no-brainer decision. At the high end, the Ultra 3 has a slightly larger screen, satellite connectivity, and longer battery life compared to last year’s model. We’ve seen $150 off, but if you want one, we’d recommend this $599 deal on the Ultra 2 instead. U.S. U.K. In the U.K. the deals are small on the newest Apple Watch models, but we anticipate that they will improve once Black Friday is here. And if they don’t our advice would be to snap up Apple’s offer, which will get you a £40 gift card. The biggest deals on offer right now are on the older models. We’d recommend Argos’s £200 off the Apple Watch Ultra 2 and Curry’s £130 off the Apple Watch Series 10. Just keep in mind that in the U.K., Apple cut the Apple Watch Series 11 and Ultra 3 prices by £30 and £50 compared to the previous generation when they were introduced. Keep this in mind when shopping, because some stores might make savings appear to be larger than they actually are. Apple updated the iPad Air with an M3 chip and the iPad Pro with an M5 chip this year. Neither update brings any huge reason to upgrade, but they’re both excellent tablets. It comes down to preference and budget—if you’re largely using your tablet for consumption (streaming, surfing, games), get an Air, for which we are seeing prices cut by $150, but if you have real work to do on it, get the Pro: you can get $100 off the M5 iPad Pro in the U.S. which is a great deal on such a new device. The mini hasn’t had a meaningful update in a couple of generations. But as we noted in our review, it’s still the best tablet for its size and a great option for anyone who values ultra portability over screen size. There’s a decent $100 off. The standard entry-level iPad A16 is an absolute steal at its Black Friday price of $275, but stock is dwindling, so if you want one act fast. Foundry U.S. U.K. We’re seeing a great £100 saving on the iPad Air, but the deals on the other iPads in the U.K. aren’t as big as they are in the U.S. The M5 iPad Pro only has a small saving, so right now we are looking at the older models to get a better discount. With that in mind, we’d recommend the M4 iPad Pro if you can find one (it’s £206 off at Amazon, but selling out fast). Apple has a great deal on for Black Friday that will run through to December 1, 2025. You can subscribe for six months for just $5.99/£4.99 a month! That’s half price! Read more here: Get Apple TV for just $6 per month. David Price / Foundry Most iPhone deals in the U.S. are through carriers and require a trade-in or adding a new line. Carriers will likely have enticing deals with trade-ins as well, but be wary of long-term contracts and terms. One opportunity worth considering is Apple’s Black Friday deal: You can buy an iPhone from Apple and get a gift voucher: In the U.K. there are less limitations on the sale of iPhones so you will be able to pick one up unlocked at a discount if you would prefer to buy an iPhone up front, rather than on a contract. Apple only launched the iPhone 17 lineup in September, so it’s a surprise that we are seeing £100 off the iPhone Air. The iPhone 16e also has £100 off at Amazon: a good saving. Also be on the look out for deals (like this one from AO) on the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max which are no longer sold by Apple but would offer a good option to those who appreciate the extra camera on the Pro iPhone models but can’t stretch to the iPhone 17 Pro. We’d suggest that when it comes to the other deals you should weigh them up against Apple’s own giveaway, where you could get £60 or £40 vouchers with the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, or iPhone 16e, respectively. For example, £100 off an iPhone 16e is better than Apple’s £40 voucher, but AO’s £55 off iPhone 16 (128GB) (which has run out now) doesn’t match Apple’s £60 voucher deal so it would be worth waiting to see it that goes lower. These are the best deals we’ve seen so far: There are lots more Apple products you can buy to go with your new Mac, iPhone, or iPad. Whether it’s a mouse and keyboard for your Mac, an Apple Pencil or keyboard cover to go with your iPad, charging cables and adapters, we are keeping track of everything so you can grab a discount this Cyber Monday. It’s a great time to grab a pack of AirTags, with prices dropping to $65 or £74 for a pack of four of Apple’s tracking devices. And we are seeing some nice price cuts on Apple Pencils (just make sure they work with your iPad first). The Apple Pencil Pro ($34 off/£20 off) is the newest model and is compatible with the iPad Pro, iPad Air, and iPad mini. Thiago Trevisan/Foundry U.S. U.K. If it doesn’t have to be AirPods, take a look at these deals on Apple owned subsidiary Beats. You might also find some deals among our best earbuds for iPhones and Best over-ear headphones. U.S. U.K. Apple holds a shopping event every Black Friday, but it doesn’t offer actual discounts. Instead, Apple gives away gift cards when you buy certain products, which can be used on a future purchase. In 2025, Apple is offering the following gift card values over Black Friday weekend: This years deal is better than last year’s, with a maximum of $250/£200 being given away in the form of gift vouchers, and in some cases, such as the iPhones, we are seeing better savings via Apple than elsewhere.

Title: Update: Coping With Inflation–Strategies for Investing, Bartering, Dickering, and Survival

Full Content:
JWR’s Introductory Note: This is an update to an article that I wrote for SurvivalBlog back in December, 2007. It is part of a series of SurvivalBlog 20th Anniversary update re-posts, in recognition of the fact that the majority of readers did not join us until recent years. — As of September, 2025, statistics released by the Federal government claim that the current inflation rate is 3.0 percent. That is utter hogwash. Their statistics cunningly omit “volatile” food and energy prices. It is apparent that something is seriously out of whack. Meanwhile, the buying power of the US Dollar has fallen versus most other currencies. Both under Biden’s administration and now under Trump’s second term, economic growth has slowed substantially. Ironically, even though credit squeezes are considered deflationary for assets, the next recession (or perhaps depression) will probably turn out to be inflationary at the consumer level. With out-of-control Federal deficit spending and a massive, compounding National Debt, I expect to see inflation continue and accelerate in the coming years. Here at the Rawles Ranch, our four largest expenses each month are fuel, groceries, livestock feed, and insurance. Our health insurance costs have nearly doubled in the past two years. The average new car now costs $50,000. I’m sure that you have seen what has happened to food and feed prices in the past two years. Driven by higher fuel and fertilizer costs, some food costs have gone up by 25%. Beef prices, for example, recently spiked to near record highs. With all of the preceding in mind, we can realistically conclude that the “real world” consumer price inflation rate is somewhere around 12%. As I’ve written many times before, inflation is a form of robbery, albeit in slow motion. Since there is effectively only one currency in our country, it is the only way to do business. It may prove difficult, but you need to discard your traditional mindset about the currency and realize that we are riding a down escalator. An inflationary environment stands traditional logic on its head, since “Saving” becomes losing, and “Investing” is almost like throwing coins into a pond if the rate of return of any investment is lower than the real world inflation rate. The only noteworthy exception is investing in tangibles, which I’ve discussed at length in many SurvivalBlog articles and columns. Obviously, you can’t invest in anything perishable. But there are lots of practical things–like tools, common caliber ammunition and full capacity magazines–that have storage lives that can span decades or even centuries. With every passing day, your savings are gradually eroded. With an effective inflation rate of 12% per annum, applying the Rule of 72 we can see how much the purchasing power of every “saved” dollar is reduced over time. The following are some of my suggestions on how to protect yourself from the ravages of inflation: A.) Buy in Bulk Buy most of your staple foods and groceries at a discount or “warehouse” type stores such as Costco or Sam’s Club. Don’t overlook the “close-out” and “dented can” stores. (But, of course, avoid buying any bulged cans, or cans with dented rims.) Stock up on non-perishable items whenever they are on sale: thing like light bulbs, paper products, bar soap, house cleaning supplies, laundry detergent, lubricants, and so forth. As long as you protect these supplies from theft, moisture and vermin, they are better than money in the bank. (Again, money in the bank is being eroded by inflation.) These are tangibles bought at today’s prices, that you can use for many years to come. Here at the Rawles Ranch, we recently used up some spices, light bulbs, and aluminum foil that I bought at a military commissary in the 1980s–at what now seem like absurdly low prices. My only regret is that I didn’t buy more of them! This approach to stockpiling was described in the modern-day classic book “The Alpha Strategy” by John Pugsley. (Download this free book and read it!) If your local zoning and fire regulations allow it, buy your own gas and diesel fuel tanks. Also consider installing oversize propane or home heating oil tanks. Always ask about the availability of used tanks or ‘trade-in” tanks. Who cares if they are in some odd color? Re-paint them a nice neutral tan color. Wait and have your extra-large tanks re-filled each time there is a price dip. (Sadly, this only happens rarely, these days.) When getting competitive bids from tank suppliers, be sure to ask them to lock in the price per gallon for the initial fill for each new tank. To win your business, the tank salesman might be willing to commit to a price that is a few pennies per gallon below current market. (This adds up on a 2,000+ gallon tank!) B.) Learn to Barter Barter, by its very nature, shields you from inflation. Instead of using depreciating paper tokens as a means of exchange, you are directly exchanging a tangible for another tangible, or a service for a tangible, or a service for a service. As I’ve written previously in SurvivalBlog on several occasions, I do advocate stocking up on extra items for barter. However, it is with the proviso that you do not embark on buying goods dedicated for barter until after you have your family’s essential beans, bullets and band-aids squared away, following a well-balanced logistics plan. Dickering is a skill that can take years to develop. For some details on dickering skills, dee my updated SurvivalBlog article: The Savvy Barterer: References, Skills, and Tools for TEOTWAWKI Barter. Here in The Un-named Western State (TUWS), there is a lot of bartering that goes on, quite informally. I see it all the time: Cartridge Reloading for Snow Plowing, Eggs for Honey, Firewood for Horse Training, and Zucchini for just a smile and a thank-you. To be useful in barter, choose items that have most or all of the following seven attributes 1.) Have appeal/usefulness to the majority of the citizenry. 2.) Be immediately recognizable. 3.) Have longevity. 4.) Be easily divisible. 5.) Be relatively compact and transportable at reasonable cost. 6.) Have consistent quality. 7.) Have limited availability. Let’s discuss each of those briefly, in turn. 1.) Have appeal/usefulness to the majority of the citizenry. Nearly every family uses soap, but just a few need #7 Singer sewing machine needles. 2.) Be immediately recognizable. Name brands need no introduction. All others are suspect. 3.) Have longevity. Keep shelf lives in mind. If you cannot barter it all away before it goes bad, then you are buying too much. Even coal has a shelf life. 4.) Be easily divisible. Boxes of matches, boxes of cartridges, coils of rope, balls of twine, and cans of kerosene are perfect examples. OBTW, if you plan on dividing a commodity in barter transactions, then be sure to have the containers needed for parceling it out. 5.) Be relatively compact and transportable at a reasonable cost. Toilet paper has great appeal, but just $500 worth would completely fill the JASBORR. 6.) Have consistent quality. (For example, precious metals coins of known purity, or ammunition from a major manufacturer such as Winchester, Remington, or Federal.) 7.) Have limited availability. I mentioned zucchini earlier, for good reason. In North America, jars of freeze-dried instant coffee would be ideal, but in Central America, they would probably be laughed at. For some extensive lists of potential barter items suggested by readers, see the SurvivalBlog Archives for October 2005 and November 2005 (scroll down to November 1st and 2nd.) For a good rationale on selecting barter goods, see this November, 2006 SurvivalBlog article by OSOM. C.) Learn Several Valuable (Barterable) Skills Every family should have at least one home-based business that they can fall back on, on the event of an economic recession or depression. Concentrate on skills rather than goods for barter. The beauty of having skills to barter, is that most of them don’t require much raw material. So, unlike barter goods, you will never “run out”. By extension, it is best to have a skill that requires very little raw material. A profession or skill that also requires a specialized tool set is fine. However, if the skill also requires delivering a factory-made device to complete each transaction, then you might consider doing something else. (For example, installing burglar alarms might be profitable as long as you have a source of resupply, and as long as the power and telephone networks are functioning. But in a grid-down TEOTWAWKI how long could you continue running such a business?) Avoid developing a skill that appeals only to wealthy customers for discretionary spending. Those are the purchases that will be delayed or skipped altogether in an economic depression, Hence, shotgun checkering and engraving are poor choices, but septic tank pumping is a good one. Concentrate on a business that can be operated without the need for grid power. It is notewothy that most of the businesses in this category existed in the 19th Century. Who knows? Maybe buggy whip makers will make a comeback in the Second Great Depression. Ideally, you should have two or even three supplementary income businesses that you can fall back on to pay your mortgage and to buy necessities, if you lose your salaried job. Depending on the severity of the coming recession or depression, some home-based business may thrive, while others won’t. It is hard to predict which businesses will do well (although we have some clues based on the experience of the 1930s,) so there is safety in redundancy. D.) Learn How to Pinch a Penny Here are some suggestions (in no particular order), some of which I’ve borrowed from “The Encyclopedia of Country Living” by Carla Emery. (We highly recommend this book.) Distinguish your needs from your wants. Research and do some comparison pricing before any purchase of more than $10. Do extensive comparison pricing before any purchase of more than $100. Never buy on impulse. Plan your purchases well in advance, do your homework, and be patient. Refer to back issues of Consumer Reports magazine (at your local library) before making a purchase of a major appliance Develop the habit of dropping by thrift stores, second-hand stores, used book stores, and pawn shops. Find out on which days particular items are discounted at thrift stores. (Often by a system of colored price tags.) For big-ticket items, do lots of comparison pricing via the Internet. If you decide to buy locally, then bring the price print-outs with you, to use as “ammunition” when you dicker. Buy off-season. Buy winter clothes in summer, and vice versa. Buy livestock in October and November, when owners are facing expensive hay purchases if they “winter-over” their livestock. Use a clothesline instead of an electric clothes dryer. Use online tools like GasBuddy to find the best local gas and diesel prices. This is particularly important when you re-fill your gasoline and diesel storage cans and drums. Heat with wood. Cut, haul, split, and stack the wood yourself. Buy your guns and ammo at gun shows, not at gun shops. Learn how to dicker for the best prices. Buy at farm auctions, but beware of impulse purchases and run-away bidding. Make a list of your maximum bids during the preview and then stick to it religiously. Never bid emotionally, and never jump in on the bidding for an article unless you planned to bid on it before the auction began. Build/make/sew things for yourself rather than buying them factory-made. If you use any national brands, then clip coupons. Keep your coupons well organized (many folks like to use an accordion folder and they keep it handy in their car), and don’t lose track of coupon expiration dates. Buy most items used, rather than new. Never buy a new “big ticket” item like a car or truck “factory new”. Be sure to refer to Edmunds.com before making any vehicle purchase, to make sure you aren’t getting a “lemon” model or model-year. If you are buying a used vehicle worth $5,000 or more, then get the car’s VIN and pay for a CARFAX vehicle history report. These reports show a car’s crash history and even flood damage history. That research is well worth the expense. Negotiate prices with merchants. It is amazing who is willing to negotiate. (But I’ve had no luck in talking down bridge toll fees. I’ll keep trying.) Spend some of your Saturday mornings at garage sales and yard sales. Dress down when you go, and don’t be afraid to negotiate for better prices. Check Craig’sList, Facebook Marketplace, eBay, and your local “penny” or “nickel” classified ad papers for bargain items or even free items. Avoid fashion trends. Dress and drive modestly. Find out when there is a curb-side “free hauling” day offered by your local waste disposal contractor. If allowable by local law, cruise through the neighborhoods the night before the scheduled collection with your pickup or trailer. This is the way we found the majority of our small livestock cages. When buying things from private parties or small businesses, offer other items or your skills in barter. Watch for free tours at educational places like factories and museums. If your community has a well-established local currency, then utilize it to the utmost. Plant a large vegetable garden. Get plant starts for berries and other perennials from neighbors Cancel your newspaper subscriptions and carefully limit your magazine subscriptions. These days, there is so much news and information available on the Internet free of charge (you are looking at some of it right now) that hardcopy newspapers are now mostly expensive dinosaurs. But there are two notable exceptions: 1.) If you are a consistent and well-organized coupon clipper. If that is the case, then you might want to get a “Sunday paper only” subscription.), and 2.) Subscribing to small-town weekly newspapers in your retreat locale. Reading one of these papers regularly is important for developing local intelligence and for “fitting in” by being knowledgeable about local geography, personalities, events, politics, and lore. Change your own car crankcase oil and make most of your own car repairs. Buy a food dehydrator. It will pay for itself many times over. Home Freeze-Dryers are also now available, but before buying one, carefully consider how much you will use it. It takes a long time for these expensive units to pay for themselves. Learn how to do your own water bath and pressure canning. Once you have, you’ll have no excuse to ever buy another store-bought jar of jam, jelly, or applesauce. Buy a few dairy sheep or a cow. Sell or barter the excess milk, or feed the excess to your chickens and/or hogs Cut out needless expenses. (Like those $4 lattes at Starbucks and $20 trips to the movie theater.) If you have a mortgage at a rate that is more than 1 percent higher than the prevailing rate, then consider refinancing. Just beware of any hidden costs and, of course, avoid Adjustable Rate Mortgages (ARMs.) Swap CDs and DVDs with friends and relatives or check them out from your local library rather than buying new ones. Keep your online video subscriptions to a minimum. Develop a budget, and stick to it. If you have a credit card, then pay it off in full every month. No exceptions! Don’t fall into the easy credit trap. Remember, the card is only in your wallet for convenience, emergency expenses (such as car repairs when travelling), and as a means to gain frequent flier miles or points for programs like gasoline purchase rebates. If you recognize that you don’t have sufficient self-control, then leave your credit card(s) at home–or cut them up. Make detailed lists of all of your expenses, and scrutinize them weekly. Look for ways to reduce expenses. Shop around for the lowest car/health/home/life insurance rates. A few hours of research on the Internet could easily save you $1,000+ per year. Unless you know for certain that you want a book as a permanent reference, then use the public library or try to find it online. Don’t overlook the inter-library loan system. Take advantage of free or low-cost training available from organizations like the American Red Cross and FEMA. (Just beware of any socialist/statist nonsense that they try to feed you along with the training.) Learn how to repair small appliances and engines. Don’t buy store-bought meat. Hunt for or raise your own. Handload your own ammunition. Get out of debt and stay out of debt. Paying interest is throwing money away. Forestall making purchases to avoid indebtedness. Instant gratification creates decades of debt. Proviso #1: Do not attempt to save money by foregoing carrying insurance, or by forestalling any expenses that have an impact on health, hygiene, or safety. For example, if your windshield gets cracked beyond repair, then replace it. If your chimney needs cleaning, then don’t delay cleaning it. (But of course buy your own brush and rod sections and learn how to do the job yourself.) If you have a toothache, don’t delay in seeing your dentist. (But ask about possibly paying in barter when you do!) Proviso# 2: Don’t be “Penny-wise and Pound-foolish.” If you are a highly-paid professional, then take into account the value of your time. For example, if you are an anesthesiologist, you should probably find a few more billable cases rather than taking up cartridge handloading. Proviso# 3: Don’t skimp on education. That is an expense that will make you money in the long run.

When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. Cyber Monday is here, and there are lots of deals to choose from, including these excellent discounts on the Apple products we recommend: Today’s best Apple deals: U.S. Today’s best Apple deals: U.K. Updated December 1: We have reviewed the best prices and found more price drops and changes. We will be regularly monitoring the best prices and will update this article throughout Cyber Monday. ‘Tis the season for savings! Whether you’re looking for a deal on an iPad, Mac, iPhone, Apple Watch, AirPods, or anything else Apple sells, there’s no better time to get one for cheap than Black Friday. The annual shopping extravaganza officially kicked off on Friday, but many of the best deals will last until today, AKA Cyber Monday on December 1. Every retailer that sells Apple gear gets in on the fun, and we are rounding up only the best deals we find right here. We regularly check prices using various tools to get a view of the very best prices right now, compared to what they were over the past days, weeks, and months, so we know an excellent deal when we see it. We’re checking and updating these prices all weekend, so mark this page and return often so you don’t miss a good deal, some of which are short-lived. Even Apple runs its own Black Friday shopping event, where it offers gift cards on certain purchases, including $50 with AirPods Pro 3, $100 for iPad Air, and $250 with a MacBook Pro. The bottom line is that there are lots of deals to be found right now, so no matter what Apple device you’re looking for, you will be able to make a saving. So take a look at the deals on all of Apple’s products below. Also, check our Best Picks round-ups, where you can find reviews of all the products we recommend. At Macworld we’ve been covering and reviewing Apple and Apple devices for more than 40 years, from the original Macintosh to the most recent M5 MacBook Pro and iPhone 17 lineup. We use Apple products every day and purchase them with our own money, so we know a good deal when we see one. More importantly, we also know how to spot a bad deal. With a working knowledge of everything Apple sells and decades of experience, we know when stores are inflating prices or pushing “normal” sales as limited Black Friday deals, so the listings you see here will only be for discounts that are at or near all-time low prices. Macworld Cyber Monday tip: While shopping during the Black Friday sales, we’ve noticed that on Amazon, if you delay your delivery date, there are additional 2-3% savings to be had. This doesn’t apply to every Apple product, unfortunately, but we have seen the additional 3% applied to AirTags, and if you have lots of other eligible products in your shopping cart, then it can add up to decent savings. Apple released the new M5 MacBook Pro in October, but still sells M4 Pro and M4 Max models as well as the M4 MacBook Air. The new M5 model is mostly a chip refresh, but it’s a great one, as we said in our 4.5-star review, and right now you can get $250 off all the 14-inch M5 MacBook Pro at Amazon, taking it $50 lower than last Thursday and down to the lowest price we have seen. However, even though the new model brings a major boost in GPU and SSD performance, we also loved the M4 model, and you can get an amazing $300 off the M4 MacBook Pro at Amazon. There are also some excellent deals on the even more powerful MacBook Pro M4 Pro and M4 Max, which are full on workstations now at amazingly low prices, such as $300 off the 14-inch M4 Pro MacBook Pro at Amazon, and a whopping $500 off the 16-inch M4 Max MacBook Pro, also at Amazon. You can find more deals below. And, of course, the MacBook Air is a fantastic option for just about anyone, earning an extremely rare 5-star score in our testing. You can get $250 off the MacBook Air at Amazon. U.K. shoppers don’t miss out either, with £184 off a 13-inch MacBook Air at Amazon. £200 off the M5 MacBook Pro at KRCS, and £349 off the M4 Pro MacBook Pro at Amazon. See even more great deals below. Foundry U.S. U.K. The iMac and Mac mini received an M4 update in October 2024, with the Mac mini also getting a dramatic redesign that shrunk the case down to just 5 inches. We loved the new Mac mini design and M4 chip and there is $120 off at Amazon. The Mac mini M4 Pro version is a great low-cost way to get a really powerful Mac, and with $150 off it’s a good saving (but it was $200 earlier in the Black Friday sale). We don’t know when they will be getting M5 chips, but if they are, they won’t arrive until 2026, so we recommend picking up one of these deals if you’re looking for a Mac desktop. U.K. users should take advantage of £100 off the Mac mini, and £130 off the Mac mini pro. Simon Jary / Foundry U.S. U.K. Apple released the AirPods Pro 3 in September 2025, with a slightly new design, foam-infused eartips, and a heart-rate sensor. We gave them a near-perfect score in our review, but also noted that it’s a relatively small upgrade over the AirPods Pro 2, which has the same H2 chip and many similar features. The new model has the same $249 MSRP in the U.S. and a slightly lower £219 RRP in the U.K. (AirPods Pro 2 were £229), so keep that in mind when shopping. We don’t expect to see AirPods Pro 3 with more than $30-$50 off, but the older AirPods Pro 2 did dip as low as $139 at Walmart, but that deal seems to have ended now, the next best option is $189 on Amazon. The AirPods 4 have been out for over a year, but are still a fantastic pair of earbuds. The Black Friday deals of $69 for AirPods 4 was superb, but stock seems to have run out now (check to see if the model is user). You can still get AirPods 4 with active noise cancellation for less than $100, which is an excellent deal. If you need a pair, grab one, just beware that AirPods deals sell out quickly, but do keep checking because stock seems to come and go. See more U.S. AirPods deals below. U.K. readers can save money on the AirPods Pro 2, currently at £169 with Argos, but we’ve also seen them at that price on Amazon (but they go out of stock quickly!). Right now you can also get £20 off the AirPods 4, bringing the price under £100. See more U.K. AirPods deals below. Petter Ahrnstedt U.S. U.K. Mike Sawh Apple launched the Apple Watch Series 11 in September, but there aren’t many exclusive new features beyond better battery life and 5G networking. The two new health features, hypertension alerts and Sleep Score, are also available on the Series 10, and there isn’t a new color this year. As we noted in our review, we don’t think Series 9 or 10 users need to upgrade. We are seeing savings of $60 on the Series 11, which is a great price for such a full-featured watch, but with $150 off the Series 10 you might want to consider that, you won’t miss out on much (See our comparison of every Apple Watch). The sleeper hit of the new Apple Watch lineup is the SE 3, which got the biggest update of all three models, gaining an always-on display, temperature sensor, a faster chip, on-device Siri, and fast charging. We gave it a near-perfect score of 4.5 stars and highly recommend it at full price—for $50 off, it’s a no-brainer decision. At the high end, the Ultra 3 has a slightly larger screen, satellite connectivity, and longer battery life compared to last year’s model. We’ve seen $150 off, but if you want one, we’d recommend this $599 deal on the Ultra 2 instead. U.S. U.K. In the U.K. the deals are small on the newest Apple Watch models, but we anticipate that they will improve once Black Friday is here. And if they don’t our advice would be to snap up Apple’s offer, which will get you a £40 gift card. The biggest deals on offer right now are on the older models. We’d recommend Argos’s £200 off the Apple Watch Ultra 2 and Curry’s £130 off the Apple Watch Series 10. Just keep in mind that in the U.K., Apple cut the Apple Watch Series 11 and Ultra 3 prices by £30 and £50 compared to the previous generation when they were introduced. Keep this in mind when shopping, because some stores might make savings appear to be larger than they actually are. Apple updated the iPad Air with an M3 chip and the iPad Pro with an M5 chip this year. Neither update brings any huge reason to upgrade, but they’re both excellent tablets. It comes down to preference and budget—if you’re largely using your tablet for consumption (streaming, surfing, games), get an Air, for which we are seeing prices cut by $150, but if you have real work to do on it, get the Pro: you can get $100 off the M5 iPad Pro in the U.S. which is a great deal on such a new device. The mini hasn’t had a meaningful update in a couple of generations. But as we noted in our review, it’s still the best tablet for its size and a great option for anyone who values ultra portability over screen size. There’s a decent $100 off. The standard entry-level iPad A16 is an absolute steal at its Black Friday price of $275, but stock is dwindling, so if you want one act fast. Foundry U.S. U.K. We’re seeing a great £100 saving on the iPad Air, but the deals on the other iPads in the U.K. aren’t as big as they are in the U.S. The M5 iPad Pro only has a small saving, so right now we are looking at the older models to get a better discount. With that in mind, we’d recommend the M4 iPad Pro if you can find one (it’s £206 off at Amazon, but selling out fast). Apple has a great deal on for Black Friday that will run through to December 1, 2025. You can subscribe for six months for just $5.99/£4.99 a month! That’s half price! Read more here: Get Apple TV for just $6 per month. David Price / Foundry Most iPhone deals in the U.S. are through carriers and require a trade-in or adding a new line. Carriers will likely have enticing deals with trade-ins as well, but be wary of long-term contracts and terms. One opportunity worth considering is Apple’s Black Friday deal: You can buy an iPhone from Apple and get a gift voucher: In the U.K. there are less limitations on the sale of iPhones so you will be able to pick one up unlocked at a discount if you would prefer to buy an iPhone up front, rather than on a contract. Apple only launched the iPhone 17 lineup in September, so it’s a surprise that we are seeing £100 off the iPhone Air. The iPhone 16e also has £100 off at Amazon: a good saving. Also be on the look out for deals (like this one from AO) on the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max which are no longer sold by Apple but would offer a good option to those who appreciate the extra camera on the Pro iPhone models but can’t stretch to the iPhone 17 Pro. We’d suggest that when it comes to the other deals you should weigh them up against Apple’s own giveaway, where you could get £60 or £40 vouchers with the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, or iPhone 16e, respectively. For example, £100 off an iPhone 16e is better than Apple’s £40 voucher, but AO’s £55 off iPhone 16 (128GB) (which has run out now) doesn’t match Apple’s £60 voucher deal so it would be worth waiting to see it that goes lower. These are the best deals we’ve seen so far: There are lots more Apple products you can buy to go with your new Mac, iPhone, or iPad. Whether it’s a mouse and keyboard for your Mac, an Apple Pencil or keyboard cover to go with your iPad, charging cables and adapters, we are keeping track of everything so you can grab a discount this Cyber Monday. It’s a great time to grab a pack of AirTags, with prices dropping to $65 or £74 for a pack of four of Apple’s tracking devices. And we are seeing some nice price cuts on Apple Pencils (just make sure they work with your iPad first). The Apple Pencil Pro ($34 off/£20 off) is the newest model and is compatible with the iPad Pro, iPad Air, and iPad mini. Thiago Trevisan/Foundry U.S. U.K. If it doesn’t have to be AirPods, take a look at these deals on Apple owned subsidiary Beats. You might also find some deals among our best earbuds for iPhones and Best over-ear headphones. U.S. U.K. Apple holds a shopping event every Black Friday, but it doesn’t offer actual discounts. Instead, Apple gives away gift cards when you buy certain products, which can be used on a future purchase. In 2025, Apple is offering the following gift card values over Black Friday weekend: This years deal is better than last year’s, with a maximum of $250/£200 being given away in the form of gift vouchers, and in some cases, such as the iPhones, we are seeing better savings via Apple than elsewhere.

The bottom line is that there are lots of deals to be found right now, so no matter what Apple device you’re looking for, you will be able to make a saving. So take a look at the deals on all of Apple’s products below. Also, check our Best Picks round-ups, where you can find reviews of all the products we recommend. At Macworld we’ve been covering and reviewing Apple and Apple devices for more than 40 years, from the original Macintosh to the most recent M5 MacBook Pro and iPhone 17 lineup. We use Apple products every day and purchase them with our own money, so we know a good deal when we see one. More importantly, we also know how to spot a bad deal. With a working knowledge of everything Apple sells and decades of experience, we know when stores are inflating prices or pushing “normal” sales as limited Black Friday deals, so the listings you see here will only be for discounts that are at or near all-time low prices. Macworld Cyber Monday tip: While shopping during the Black Friday sales, we’ve noticed that on Amazon, if you delay your delivery date, there are additional 2-3% savings to be had. This doesn’t apply to every Apple product, unfortunately, but we have seen the additional 3% applied to AirTags, and if you have lots of other eligible products in your shopping cart, then it can add up to decent savings. Apple released the new M5 MacBook Pro in October, but still sells M4 Pro and M4 Max models as well as the M4 MacBook Air. The new M5 model is mostly a chip refresh, but it’s a great one, as we said in our 4.5-star review, and right now you can get $250 off all the 14-inch M5 MacBook Pro at Amazon, taking it $50 lower than last Thursday and down to the lowest price we have seen. However, even though the new model brings a major boost in GPU and SSD performance, we also loved the M4 model, and you can get an amazing $300 off the M4 MacBook Pro at Amazon. There are also some excellent deals on the even more powerful MacBook Pro M4 Pro and M4 Max, which are full on workstations now at amazingly low prices, such as $300 off the 14-inch M4 Pro MacBook Pro at Amazon, and a whopping $500 off the 16-inch M4 Max MacBook Pro, also at Amazon. You can find more deals below. And, of course, the MacBook Air is a fantastic option for just about anyone, earning an extremely rare 5-star score in our testing. You can get $250 off the MacBook Air at Amazon. U.K. shoppers don’t miss out either, with £184 off a 13-inch MacBook Air at Amazon. £200 off the M5 MacBook Pro at KRCS, and £349 off the M4 Pro MacBook Pro at Amazon. See even more great deals below. Foundry U.S. U.K. The iMac and Mac mini received an M4 update in October 2024, with the Mac mini also getting a dramatic redesign that shrunk the case down to just 5 inches. We loved the new Mac mini design and M4 chip and there is $120 off at Amazon. The Mac mini M4 Pro version is a great low-cost way to get a really powerful Mac, and with $150 off it’s a good saving (but it was $200 earlier in the Black Friday sale). We don’t know when they will be getting M5 chips, but if they are, they won’t arrive until 2026, so we recommend picking up one of these deals if you’re looking for a Mac desktop. U.K. users should take advantage of £100 off the Mac mini, and £130 off the Mac mini pro. Simon Jary / Foundry U.S. U.K. Apple released the AirPods Pro 3 in September 2025, with a slightly new design, foam-infused eartips, and a heart-rate sensor. We gave them a near-perfect score in our review, but also noted that it’s a relatively small upgrade over the AirPods Pro 2, which has the same H2 chip and many similar features. The new model has the same $249 MSRP in the U.S. and a slightly lower £219 RRP in the U.K. (AirPods Pro 2 were £229), so keep that in mind when shopping. We don’t expect to see AirPods Pro 3 with more than $30-$50 off, but the older AirPods Pro 2 did dip as low as $139 at Walmart, but that deal seems to have ended now, the next best option is $189 on Amazon. The AirPods 4 have been out for over a year, but are still a fantastic pair of earbuds. The Black Friday deals of $69 for AirPods 4 was superb, but stock seems to have run out now (check to see if the model is user). You can still get AirPods 4 with active noise cancellation for less than $100, which is an excellent deal. If you need a pair, grab one, just beware that AirPods deals sell out quickly, but do keep checking because stock seems to come and go. See more U.S. AirPods deals below. U.K. readers can save money on the AirPods Pro 2, currently at £169 with Argos, but we’ve also seen them at that price on Amazon (but they go out of stock quickly!). Right now you can also get £20 off the AirPods 4, bringing the price under £100. See more U.K. AirPods deals below. Petter Ahrnstedt U.S. U.K. Mike Sawh Apple launched the Apple Watch Series 11 in September, but there aren’t many exclusive new features beyond better battery life and 5G networking. The two new health features, hypertension alerts and Sleep Score, are also available on the Series 10, and there isn’t a new color this year. As we noted in our review, we don’t think Series 9 or 10 users need to upgrade. We are seeing savings of $60 on the Series 11, which is a great price for such a full-featured watch, but with $150 off the Series 10 you might want to consider that, you won’t miss out on much (See our comparison of every Apple Watch). The sleeper hit of the new Apple Watch lineup is the SE 3, which got the biggest update of all three models, gaining an always-on display, temperature sensor, a faster chip, on-device Siri, and fast charging. We gave it a near-perfect score of 4.5 stars and highly recommend it at full price—for $50 off, it’s a no-brainer decision. At the high end, the Ultra 3 has a slightly larger screen, satellite connectivity, and longer battery life compared to last year’s model. We’ve seen $150 off, but if you want one, we’d recommend this $599 deal on the Ultra 2 instead. U.S. U.K. In the U.K. the deals are small on the newest Apple Watch models, but we anticipate that they will improve once Black Friday is here. And if they don’t our advice would be to snap up Apple’s offer, which will get you a £40 gift card. The biggest deals on offer right now are on the older models. We’d recommend Argos’s £200 off the Apple Watch Ultra 2 and Curry’s £130 off the Apple Watch Series 10. Just keep in mind that in the U.K., Apple cut the Apple Watch Series 11 and Ultra 3 prices by £30 and £50 compared to the previous generation when they were introduced. Keep this in mind when shopping, because some stores might make savings appear to be larger than they actually are. Apple updated the iPad Air with an M3 chip and the iPad Pro with an M5 chip this year. Neither update brings any huge reason to upgrade, but they’re both excellent tablets. It comes down to preference and budget—if you’re largely using your tablet for consumption (streaming, surfing, games), get an Air, for which we are seeing prices cut by $150, but if you have real work to do on it, get the Pro: you can get $100 off the M5 iPad Pro in the U.S. which is a great deal on such a new device. The mini hasn’t had a meaningful update in a couple of generations. But as we noted in our review, it’s still the best tablet for its size and a great option for anyone who values ultra portability over screen size. There’s a decent $100 off. The standard entry-level iPad A16 is an absolute steal at its Black Friday price of $275, but stock is dwindling, so if you want one act fast. Foundry U.S. U.K. We’re seeing a great £100 saving on the iPad Air, but the deals on the other iPads in the U.K. aren’t as big as they are in the U.S. The M5 iPad Pro only has a small saving, so right now we are looking at the older models to get a better discount. With that in mind, we’d recommend the M4 iPad Pro if you can find one (it’s £206 off at Amazon, but selling out fast). Apple has a great deal on for Black Friday that will run through to December 1, 2025. You can subscribe for six months for just $5.99/£4.99 a month! That’s half price! Read more here: Get Apple TV for just $6 per month. David Price / Foundry Most iPhone deals in the U.S. are through carriers and require a trade-in or adding a new line. Carriers will likely have enticing deals with trade-ins as well, but be wary of long-term contracts and terms. One opportunity worth considering is Apple’s Black Friday deal: You can buy an iPhone from Apple and get a gift voucher: In the U.K. there are less limitations on the sale of iPhones so you will be able to pick one up unlocked at a discount if you would prefer to buy an iPhone up front, rather than on a contract. Apple only launched the iPhone 17 lineup in September, so it’s a surprise that we are seeing £100 off the iPhone Air. The iPhone 16e also has £100 off at Amazon: a good saving. Also be on the look out for deals (like this one from AO) on the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max which are no longer sold by Apple but would offer a good option to those who appreciate the extra camera on the Pro iPhone models but can’t stretch to the iPhone 17 Pro. We’d suggest that when it comes to the other deals you should weigh them up against Apple’s own giveaway, where you could get £60 or £40 vouchers with the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, or iPhone 16e, respectively. For example, £100 off an iPhone 16e is better than Apple’s £40 voucher, but AO’s £55 off iPhone 16 (128GB) (which has run out now) doesn’t match Apple’s £60 voucher deal so it would be worth waiting to see it that goes lower. These are the best deals we’ve seen so far: There are lots more Apple products you can buy to go with your new Mac, iPhone, or iPad. Whether it’s a mouse and keyboard for your Mac, an Apple Pencil or keyboard cover to go with your iPad, charging cables and adapters, we are keeping track of everything so you can grab a discount this Cyber Monday. It’s a great time to grab a pack of AirTags, with prices dropping to $65 or £74 for a pack of four of Apple’s tracking devices. And we are seeing some nice price cuts on Apple Pencils (just make sure they work with your iPad first). The Apple Pencil Pro ($34 off/£20 off) is the newest model and is compatible with the iPad Pro, iPad Air, and iPad mini. Thiago Trevisan/Foundry U.S. U.K. If it doesn’t have to be AirPods, take a look at these deals on Apple owned subsidiary Beats. You might also find some deals among our best earbuds for iPhones and Best over-ear headphones. U.S. U.K. Apple holds a shopping event every Black Friday, but it doesn’t offer actual discounts. Instead, Apple gives away gift cards when you buy certain products, which can be used on a future purchase. In 2025, Apple is offering the following gift card values over Black Friday weekend: This years deal is better than last year’s, with a maximum of $250/£200 being given away in the form of gift vouchers, and in some cases, such as the iPhones, we are seeing better savings via Apple than elsewhere.

SP Lover's notes SIMON_ Matrix Featured Article Matrix is the writing community of SSPAI, where we encourage sharing authentic product experiences, practical insights, and thoughtful reflections. We regularly feature the finest Matrix articles to showcase genuine perspectives from real users. The article represents the author’s personal views. SSPAI has only made minor edits to the title and formatting.Featured on the Matrix homepage 2025 marks my fifth year in Japan. Ever since I moved here in 2021, I’ve made it a habit to review my yearly spending at the end of each year and share the items I used most frequently and enjoyed the most. This year is no exception. Rather than a “best-of” product list, it’s more like a reflection on my year. Since I continued traveling frequently in 2025, my spending still leaned toward outdoor and lifestyle items, with very little interest in upgrading tech gadgets. So once again, the “Lifestyle” section comes first — if you’re only here for the “Tech” part, feel free to scroll straight down. Following my principle that “there is no perfect product,” this year’s list also includes a brief “downsides” section for each item to help give a more balanced impression. And because I want to save you the trouble of hunting down prices and where to buy things, I’ll do my best to include a reference price1 and purchase channel2 under each recommendation. The North Face Expedition Series Parka A parka warm enough to handle –20°C, and it accompanied me through the harsh winters of two Northeasts (China’s Northeast and Japan’s Tōhoku) as well as Hokkaido. The reason I chose this jacket is simple: among down jackets, it has the best silhouette, and among parkas, it’s one of the warmest. As one of the premium offerings from The North Face Japan line, this coat features nearly all of their signature technologies: GORE-TEX (2-layer, not 3-layer), PERTEX Quantum (originally used for UK parachutes, later acquired by Mitsui Japan), CLEANDOWN (high-cleanliness down from a long-established Mie Prefecture manufacturer), and Photon Thermo (The North Face Japan’s go-to thermal tech — essentially far-infrared). It may not be the ultimate top-tier product, but it’s extremely versatile and dependable for cold regions. It also frequently goes on sale, so I recommend waiting for discounts to get the best value. Downsides: The jacket is heavy; harder to pack than typical down jackets; faux fur hood trim is mediocre; the new model (ND92546) costs ¥2,000 more without noticeable improvements. ARC’TERYX Gamma MX Hoody This year, aside from shells, I bought quite a bit of Arc’teryx: wool socks, gloves, Gamma pants and tops, quick-dry tees, Atom jackets, hats — basically one of each iconic item. Among everything I’ve tried, the Gamma series is the most worth buying. It has repeatedly appeared on “Best Outdoor Softshell” lists and is often sold out. The Gamma MX I purchased was originally designed as a close-fitting piece for ice climbing, but in recent years the fit has been updated to a more relaxed style, making it suitable for all body types and everyday wear. Details are excellent for this price point: Fortius™ 2.0 fabric for wind resistance and light water repellency with breathability; reinforced glued seams at the hem and hood; windproof cuffs; and a fleeced interior for warmth in spring and autumn. The reason I recommend the Gamma series: it’s one of the few Arc’teryx lines that genuinely works across multiple scenarios. With three different thicknesses available, there’s an option for both northern and southern climates. In spring and fall, it works perfectly as an outer layer; in winter or during outdoor activities, pairing it with a down jacket or hardshell turns it into a warm and reliable mid-layer. The Fortius™ fabric is very stretchy — great for outdoor sports and commuting — and the light water resistance is enough for Japan’s rainy season. The more straightforward reason I bought it this year: the new olive-green color was simply irresistible. Downsides: Expensive. The avalanche incident earlier this year severely damaged the brand’s reputation, and I strongly disapprove of that behavior. However, based on the Arc’teryx events I’ve attended in Japan, their Japan operations are still outstanding. EVERGOODS × Carryology MPL22 Backpack When looking for a new backpack this year, I compared popular brands such as Aer, Able Carry, ALPAKA, and Matador. But considering my actual needs — a pack suitable for both inter-city commuting and light hiking around urban outskirts — I ultimately chose the EVERGOODS MPL22. The MPL22 is designed specifically to transition seamlessly between mountain trails and city streets, making it a perfect match for my use cases. The only issue: the standard MPL22 uses 420d nylon, which doesn’t have the same crisp, structured look as X-Pac and looks a bit too plain in full black. Appearance-wise, it simply didn’t excite me. The collaboration edition I eventually bought upgrades the material to ULTRA 200TX — an ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) fabric — offering full waterproofing and exceptional strength. The gray exterior has a refined titanium-like sheen under light, paired with a bright blue interior (TX70 ULTRA), a color combination I really love. In addition, several small design details were upgraded from the standard version:• A metal Velcro patch featuring the Krudde (a fearsome creature from Dutch folklore)• YKK’s high-performance RC-series water-resistant zippers• Anodized aluminum hardware• A fully suspended laptop compartment• A hidden pocket designed to store an AirTagAnd many more thoughtful touches — too many to list here. Interested readers can refer to the official making-of notes and videos linked later. After several months of use, whether hiking, trekking, or commuting, I remain extremely satisfied with this bag. Its 22L capacity is just right — never bulky. The adjustable sternum strap adapts well to my body, offering excellent carrying comfort. The internal pocket layout is also very smart, allowing every piece of my EDC to find its perfect spot. If you’re curious about this backpack, check out the official YouTube video or the detailed manufacturing notes to understand its design philosophy and construction. Downsides: The collaboration model is expensive — the standard version offers far better value. Also, the lack of a luggage pass-through strap is a notable regret. YAMANO3 Flower MOUNTAIN × NANGA Outdoor Shoes Flower MOUNTAIN is a relatively niche brand. Although I’d been aware of it for a while, it didn’t truly enter my radar until this collaboration with the Japanese outdoor brand NANGA. I saw this pair in person at NANGA’s Harajuku store — my first impression was that the design looked striking and the craftsmanship appeared refined. After trying them on and finding the comfort surprisingly good, I decided to buy them. Compared with the regular YAMANO3, the collaboration model features two major upgrades: What also appealed to me was the Microban lining, which provides antibacterial and deodorizing properties, and the cork insole, which offers excellent moisture absorption. The shoes I initially bought purely for their looks have now accompanied me up Mount Asahi and Mount Kuro, and have been worn for multiple outdoor hikes and rainy-day strolls. Similar to the backpack mentioned earlier, I’d describe these shoes as suitable for both city streetwear and light outdoor use. Overall, it’s a collaboration that balances style and function — matching NANGA’s outdoor DNA while retaining Flower MOUNTAIN’s distinctly Japanese aesthetic. Downsides: Due to the waterproof materials, breathability is somewhat limited, making them better suited for autumn and winter. They are intended for light outdoor activities rather than professional-level hiking. KEEN HYPERPORT CLOG LEATHER KEEN, a Japanese brand, released this all-season clog in 2025. Known for its near-obsessive dedication to sandal design (alongside its outdoor line), KEEN launches countless sandal models each year—yet none have ever truly appealed to me aesthetically. This year’s model, however, feels like a hybrid between a Birkenstock clog and something uniquely KEEN. The upper is made of leather and equipped with an easily adjustable buckle for a secure fit outdoors. The outsole uses the brand’s own Aquagrip rubber for reliable slip resistance. What convinced me to choose this pair was simple: more affordable than Birkenstocks, and much easier to style. After wearing them for a full year, I can say they are extremely comfortable. The toe box is wide enough for natural movement, and the thick midsole makes them far more suitable for outdoor casual use compared to regular slippers. Shopping, commuting—no problem at all. Two Brands: SHIRO & LINC CORPORATION This year, my skincare trials revolved mainly around two brands from Hokkaido: SHIRO and LINC ORIGINAL MAKERS. SHIRO is known for its natural ingredients and signature “transparent freshness.” The FREESIA MIST continues this tradition with a fresh fragrance profile: a bright fruity opening of apple and apricot, a floral mid-note, and a subtle woody base. The texture is thin and spreads smoothly, leaving the skin with a moisturized, subtly glossy finish once absorbed. LINC also highlights naturally derived scents. The No. 997 hand cream I picked leans fruity as well. According to the brand, the top notes bring a sweet-tart orchard freshness; the middle notes blend the clarity of geranium and lily of the valley, like sunlight filtering through grass; the base introduces a soft sandalwood reminiscent of a tranquil forest breeze. In practice, the sandalwood lingers the longest (a bit similar to LE LABO’s newly released Santal 33?), refined and non-greasy. Compared to SHIRO, the LINC cream has a thicker texture and longer-lasting scent. Downsides: SHIRO’s fragrance can become cloying over time—or, as many say, may smell a bit “cheap.” Best to try it in person if possible. Costco 93% Duck Down Comforter This winter has been one of the colder ones in Japan, so I picked up this duck down comforter while it was on sale at Costco. The biggest change it brought is that the entire winter, getting into bed felt like sinking into a hotel duvet—extremely comfortable. The best thing about down comforters is that they’re warm yet lightweight. The duck down filling is also of high cleanliness with no unpleasant odor whatsoever. I bought the 1 kg version with 95% duck down fill, and there’s also a goose-down option. Regardless of version, all the down is certified by CIL (Comprehensive Sleep Institute), meets RDS international standards, and is processed with Aller G Plus deodorizing and antibacterial treatment. Being able to trust the filling is the biggest reason I recommend it. In Japan, Japanese-made down comforters often cost over ¥100,000 (e.g., Nishikawa). This Costco comforter is a breath of fresh air—affordable, and even discounted during winter. My final purchase price was ¥12,980, making it incredibly cost-effective. Downsides: None so far. Bellroy Lite Duffel Gym Bag This is a gym bag with excellent texture and craftsmanship, supporting two carrying modes: hand-carry and shoulder-carry (with a detachable strap included). The interior is well-organized, with two bottle pockets and two small item pockets; there’s a built-in AirTag pocket; and the bag can be folded down into a compact size when not in use. The capacity is just right for me. The exterior fabric is water-repellent and has successfully protected my belongings through several surprise downpours; the bag itself is lightweight, making it perfect for going back and forth between home and the gym. Downsides: Expensive at full price. No dedicated shoe compartment. As a travel bag, it lacks a strap to secure it onto a suitcase handle. Patagonia Capilene® Cool Daily Shirt Quick-Dry Baselayer Thanks to the fitness habit I mentioned earlier, I tried quite a few base layer brands this year: Lululemon, Mizuno, Arc’teryx, Montbell and so on. After comparing these, the one most worth recommending is Patagonia’s C1 quick-dry. That’s almost stating the obvious—anyone who knows Patagonia a bit probably already knows that one of their must-try products is the Capilene C1 quick-dry series. The reason I recommend it is that it strikes a great balance between price and performance: it feels great to wear, has excellent quick-drying and odor-control capabilities, comes with a tear-off care label, and is reasonably priced. As for other brands, if we ignore price, Arc’teryx’s Konseal Pocket quick-dry series would probably be my top pick. Unfortunately, the price is high enough to buy at least two pieces from other brands, so I’m not including it in the recommendation list. Downside: It does nothing to hide your body shape—any “flaws” will be fully exposed. Kao Steam Eye Mask (Lavender Scent) An old product in new packaging. A friend once randomly gave me one to try, and I’ve been hooked ever since. These Kao steam eye masks have kept me company through many nights, as well as countless breaks on long bus and plane rides. They’re designed as single-use, so they’re very lightweight, easy to carry, and you just toss them after use—super convenient. There is an unscented version, but I still prefer the scented ones, especially lavender and osmanthus; those scents make it easier for me to slip into a relaxed, sleepy state. Of course, this is very subjective, but it works extremely well for me. Downside: None for now. Mitsubishi Uni-ball Zento Sign Pen The magnetic cap is dangerously addictive—you’ll find yourself clicking it open and shut nonstop. The pen itself has a metal body with a matte coating, giving it a premium feel. The newly developed ZENTO ink includes a “POA surfactant,” which reduces friction against paper even further, resulting in an exceptionally smooth writing experience and minimal ghosting. The weight distribution of the pen has also been adjusted so that the center of gravity sits near the web of your hand, making it comfortable even during extended writing sessions. The overall balance is excellent—you can almost feel that “the pen moves with your mind” smoothness the moment you pick it up. Downside: Pricey. If you just want to try the smooth ink, the standard model is enough. THE SUPERIOR LABOR Wallet In my earlier article “Three Years with a Backpack: My Travel Gear List,” I mentioned wanting a short wallet to replace the long one I had been using. My options at the time were RE:FORM and Bellroy, but the former’s material attracts dust easily, while the latter doesn’t fit well with Japan’s coin-heavy payment habits. Just in time for THE SUPERIOR LABOR’s year-end sale, I picked up this classic Japanese-style wallet at a great price. I call it a “Japanese wallet” mainly because of two features (which also made me choose it): First, despite being a bi-fold wallet with limited space, it includes a coin pocket that opens at a wide angle—perfect for Japan’s cash-centered society. In my case I rarely use coins, so I use this pocket to store my AirTag instead. Second, the craftsmanship. This wallet is made from Japanese Black Wagyu leather, often called the “black diamond of the leather world.” It is tanned using the traditional shironameshi method, which avoids chemical agents and instead uses natural materials like shell ash, salt, and oils. The coloring is done with urushi-nuri, a technique that uses lacquer tree sap. Both methods are traditional techniques and very much reflect Japanese craftsmanship philosophy. Downside: Because of the coin-pocket design, the wallet is on the thicker side. As always, here are some food and drink recommendations to wrap up the lifestyle section: IYOSHI COLA Japan’s version of Laoshan Cola: a cola base infused with traditional herbal ingredients, essentially a medicinal-style Coca-Cola. If you enjoy Laoshan Cola, you’ll almost certainly like Iyoshi Cola—the herbal taste is even stronger, and you’ll often find a bit of herbal sediment at the bottom. This is the kind of drink people either absolutely love or flat-out hate. If you’re a fan of herbal flavors, it’s definitely worth a try. Iyoshi Cola has easily become the drink I consume most frequently this year—nothing else even comes close. Downside: Expensive; the distinctive medicinal flavor can be off-putting for some. Tokyo Milk Cheese Factory Cookies One of my favorite snacks this year. They come in a variety of flavors; my personal picks are Truffle & Cheddar (savory-sweet) and Uji Matcha (sweet). The cookies look a bit like Shiroi Koibito, but taste much better: crisp yet not dry, with smooth, layered fillings that never feel cloying. The Truffle & Cheddar flavor has a subtle savory aroma, with the truffle fragrance blending harmoniously—perfect when paired with black tea as an afternoon treat. The Uji Matcha version balances a gentle bitterness with the soft sweetness of mascarpone, resulting in a wonderfully delicate flavor profile. Downside: Uses no animal butter; the ingredient list is noticeably long… Then let’s talk about two things that aren’t practical but add emotional value: Alapaka 9th Anniversary Limited-Edition Patch A limited-edition badge collection released for ALPAKA’s 9th anniversary. The brand invited nine renowned street artists from around the world, each offering their own creative interpretation of ALPAKA’s core theme — “Keep Moving Forward.” Each patch has a completely different style, and I switch them around on my various accessory bags. No deeper reason — they just look cool. We Are Twinkle People I bought some Pop Mart stock earlier this year and sold too early. Recently I discovered that the Twinkle figures are way too cute. When I’m in a bad mood, giving the little Twinkle guy a squish instantly lifts my spirits. No major purpose — just emotional value as a little “gift back” to Pop Mart for that stock. The rest is pure serotonin. This year’s tech section can be summed up as “nothing remarkable.” My usual habit of upgrading my iPhone annually was interrupted — although I did buy the latest iPhone 17 Pro Max, I immediately sold it to a buyback shop. Overall, I’ve hit a “vacuum phase” with electronics, feeling little motivation to replace or upgrade anything throughout the year. DJI Action 5 Pro As I mentioned in My Travel Gear List After Three Years of Backpacking, the main purpose of this purchase was to replace my old GoPro 9 — pairing it with a car mount for road-trip scenery, or a neck mount for hiking and trekking logs. The 30,000-yen purchase price plus points made it a great deal. The compact body is easy to carry, and compared with my old GoPro, the magnetic mounting system saves a lot of hassle during setup and removal Downside: DJI released the Action 6 at the end of this year, making the 5 Pro an older model. Personally, though, I don’t see a strong reason to upgrade. Panasonic ES-PV3A Electric Shaver A frequent appearance in my recommendations this year. Lightweight, long-lasting battery, USB-C charging — all solid selling points. But the real highlight is how incredibly compact it is: super portable without compromising shaving performance. I’ve tried Braun’s foil shavers before, but had to switch back to Philips after developing a nickel allergy to Braun’s foil. Panasonic’s ES-PV3A, however, contains no nickel, and its foil head shaves noticeably cleaner than Philips’ rotary design. It has become an absolute essential for my trips this year. Downside: Zhitai Portable SSD Because of work, I’ve used portable drives from Samsung, SanDisk, LaCie, and others. Earlier this year, I bought my first domestically made portable SSD — the Zhitai. After nearly a year of heavy usage (storing large quantities of photos and videos, long continuous data transfers), it has remained extremely stable and reliable. Compared with Samsung’s T7 series, the Zhitai drive is cheaper and faster. While long-term durability still needs more time to judge, its performance so far has been excellent. The included dual-head data cable and surprisingly good-quality carrying case also add extra value to the overall package. Nitecore EDC23 Flashlight Since rural areas in Japan often lack streetlights — and because I frequently walk mountain roads at night — I still need a compact flashlight for safety. The EDC23’s flat, compact design is highly portable, yet it can instantly burst to 2,500 lumens of brightness. USB-C charging is another major convenience, saving me from carrying a proprietary cable. I also bought two other popular models this year — the SK-05 and Xiaomi’s multifunction portable flashlight. Both perform well, but due to size differences, neither is as convenient to carry as the EDC23, so I’ll leave them out for now. Downside:The 2,550-lumen turbo mode only lasts a few seconds before the flashlight forces a cooldown. Razer Pro Click V2 Ergonomic Mouse I bought this as a replacement for my current Logitech MX Vertical ergonomic mouse. Compared with the MX Vertical, the Pro Click V2 is better suited for users with larger hands. Once you get used to Razer’s grip style, you’ll find that its mold design is more reasonable and comfortable than the MX Vertical. The matte plastic shell is also a huge advantage for someone like me with “acidic hands”—it doesn’t get corroded or damaged by sweat the way the rubber coating on the MX Vertical does. In addition, its DPI is significantly higher than Logitech’s, making cursor movements more responsive and precise, especially on high-resolution monitors or multi-screen setups. Downside:Just like Logitech’s office drivers, Razer’s software is terrible. The mouse also has a built-in RGB light—if you leave it on, battery life drops drastically. When connected via Bluetooth, wake-from-sleep is noticeably slower than Logitech’s. This is both the conclusion and the disclaimer. Everything listed above represents items that I personally selected with great care throughout the year — but my definition of “good products” is entirely subjective. These items are simply what best fit me, not necessarily what will fit everyone. If anything here gives you even a little inspiration, then that alone makes this article worthwhile. There is no such thing as a perfect product, but I hope this 2025 favorites roundup offers you a broader reference range for your future purchases. If you have any questions, feel free to leave a comment below — I’d be happy to chat.See you again in the 2026 favorites share.

SP Lover's notes SIMON_ Matrix Featured Article Matrix is the writing community of SSPAI, where we encourage sharing authentic product experiences, practical insights, and thoughtful reflections. We regularly feature the finest Matrix articles to showcase genuine perspectives from real users. The article represents the author’s personal views. SSPAI has only made minor edits to the title and formatting.Featured on the Matrix homepage 2025 marks my fifth year in Japan. Ever since I moved here in 2021, I’ve made it a habit to review my yearly spending at the end of each year and share the items I used most frequently and enjoyed the most. This year is no exception. Rather than a “best-of” product list, it’s more like a reflection on my year. Since I continued traveling frequently in 2025, my spending still leaned toward outdoor and lifestyle items, with very little interest in upgrading tech gadgets. So once again, the “Lifestyle” section comes first — if you’re only here for the “Tech” part, feel free to scroll straight down. Following my principle that “there is no perfect product,” this year’s list also includes a brief “downsides” section for each item to help give a more balanced impression. And because I want to save you the trouble of hunting down prices and where to buy things, I’ll do my best to include a reference price1 and purchase channel2 under each recommendation. The North Face Expedition Series Parka A parka warm enough to handle –20°C, and it accompanied me through the harsh winters of two Northeasts (China’s Northeast and Japan’s Tōhoku) as well as Hokkaido. The reason I chose this jacket is simple: among down jackets, it has the best silhouette, and among parkas, it’s one of the warmest. As one of the premium offerings from The North Face Japan line, this coat features nearly all of their signature technologies: GORE-TEX (2-layer, not 3-layer), PERTEX Quantum (originally used for UK parachutes, later acquired by Mitsui Japan), CLEANDOWN (high-cleanliness down from a long-established Mie Prefecture manufacturer), and Photon Thermo (The North Face Japan’s go-to thermal tech — essentially far-infrared). It may not be the ultimate top-tier product, but it’s extremely versatile and dependable for cold regions. It also frequently goes on sale, so I recommend waiting for discounts to get the best value. Downsides: The jacket is heavy; harder to pack than typical down jackets; faux fur hood trim is mediocre; the new model (ND92546) costs ¥2,000 more without noticeable improvements. ARC’TERYX Gamma MX Hoody This year, aside from shells, I bought quite a bit of Arc’teryx: wool socks, gloves, Gamma pants and tops, quick-dry tees, Atom jackets, hats — basically one of each iconic item. Among everything I’ve tried, the Gamma series is the most worth buying. It has repeatedly appeared on “Best Outdoor Softshell” lists and is often sold out. The Gamma MX I purchased was originally designed as a close-fitting piece for ice climbing, but in recent years the fit has been updated to a more relaxed style, making it suitable for all body types and everyday wear. Details are excellent for this price point: Fortius™ 2.0 fabric for wind resistance and light water repellency with breathability; reinforced glued seams at the hem and hood; windproof cuffs; and a fleeced interior for warmth in spring and autumn. The reason I recommend the Gamma series: it’s one of the few Arc’teryx lines that genuinely works across multiple scenarios. With three different thicknesses available, there’s an option for both northern and southern climates. In spring and fall, it works perfectly as an outer layer; in winter or during outdoor activities, pairing it with a down jacket or hardshell turns it into a warm and reliable mid-layer. The Fortius™ fabric is very stretchy — great for outdoor sports and commuting — and the light water resistance is enough for Japan’s rainy season. The more straightforward reason I bought it this year: the new olive-green color was simply irresistible. Downsides: Expensive. The avalanche incident earlier this year severely damaged the brand’s reputation, and I strongly disapprove of that behavior. However, based on the Arc’teryx events I’ve attended in Japan, their Japan operations are still outstanding. EVERGOODS × Carryology MPL22 Backpack When looking for a new backpack this year, I compared popular brands such as Aer, Able Carry, ALPAKA, and Matador. But considering my actual needs — a pack suitable for both inter-city commuting and light hiking around urban outskirts — I ultimately chose the EVERGOODS MPL22. The MPL22 is designed specifically to transition seamlessly between mountain trails and city streets, making it a perfect match for my use cases. The only issue: the standard MPL22 uses 420d nylon, which doesn’t have the same crisp, structured look as X-Pac and looks a bit too plain in full black. Appearance-wise, it simply didn’t excite me. The collaboration edition I eventually bought upgrades the material to ULTRA 200TX — an ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) fabric — offering full waterproofing and exceptional strength. The gray exterior has a refined titanium-like sheen under light, paired with a bright blue interior (TX70 ULTRA), a color combination I really love. In addition, several small design details were upgraded from the standard version:• A metal Velcro patch featuring the Krudde (a fearsome creature from Dutch folklore)• YKK’s high-performance RC-series water-resistant zippers• Anodized aluminum hardware• A fully suspended laptop compartment• A hidden pocket designed to store an AirTagAnd many more thoughtful touches — too many to list here. Interested readers can refer to the official making-of notes and videos linked later. After several months of use, whether hiking, trekking, or commuting, I remain extremely satisfied with this bag. Its 22L capacity is just right — never bulky. The adjustable sternum strap adapts well to my body, offering excellent carrying comfort. The internal pocket layout is also very smart, allowing every piece of my EDC to find its perfect spot. If you’re curious about this backpack, check out the official YouTube video or the detailed manufacturing notes to understand its design philosophy and construction. Downsides: The collaboration model is expensive — the standard version offers far better value. Also, the lack of a luggage pass-through strap is a notable regret. YAMANO3 Flower MOUNTAIN × NANGA Outdoor Shoes Flower MOUNTAIN is a relatively niche brand. Although I’d been aware of it for a while, it didn’t truly enter my radar until this collaboration with the Japanese outdoor brand NANGA. I saw this pair in person at NANGA’s Harajuku store — my first impression was that the design looked striking and the craftsmanship appeared refined. After trying them on and finding the comfort surprisingly good, I decided to buy them. Compared with the regular YAMANO3, the collaboration model features two major upgrades: What also appealed to me was the Microban lining, which provides antibacterial and deodorizing properties, and the cork insole, which offers excellent moisture absorption. The shoes I initially bought purely for their looks have now accompanied me up Mount Asahi and Mount Kuro, and have been worn for multiple outdoor hikes and rainy-day strolls. Similar to the backpack mentioned earlier, I’d describe these shoes as suitable for both city streetwear and light outdoor use. Overall, it’s a collaboration that balances style and function — matching NANGA’s outdoor DNA while retaining Flower MOUNTAIN’s distinctly Japanese aesthetic. Downsides: Due to the waterproof materials, breathability is somewhat limited, making them better suited for autumn and winter. They are intended for light outdoor activities rather than professional-level hiking. KEEN HYPERPORT CLOG LEATHER KEEN, a Japanese brand, released this all-season clog in 2025. Known for its near-obsessive dedication to sandal design (alongside its outdoor line), KEEN launches countless sandal models each year—yet none have ever truly appealed to me aesthetically. This year’s model, however, feels like a hybrid between a Birkenstock clog and something uniquely KEEN. The upper is made of leather and equipped with an easily adjustable buckle for a secure fit outdoors. The outsole uses the brand’s own Aquagrip rubber for reliable slip resistance. What convinced me to choose this pair was simple: more affordable than Birkenstocks, and much easier to style. After wearing them for a full year, I can say they are extremely comfortable. The toe box is wide enough for natural movement, and the thick midsole makes them far more suitable for outdoor casual use compared to regular slippers. Shopping, commuting—no problem at all. Two Brands: SHIRO & LINC CORPORATION This year, my skincare trials revolved mainly around two brands from Hokkaido: SHIRO and LINC ORIGINAL MAKERS. SHIRO is known for its natural ingredients and signature “transparent freshness.” The FREESIA MIST continues this tradition with a fresh fragrance profile: a bright fruity opening of apple and apricot, a floral mid-note, and a subtle woody base. The texture is thin and spreads smoothly, leaving the skin with a moisturized, subtly glossy finish once absorbed. LINC also highlights naturally derived scents. The No. 997 hand cream I picked leans fruity as well. According to the brand, the top notes bring a sweet-tart orchard freshness; the middle notes blend the clarity of geranium and lily of the valley, like sunlight filtering through grass; the base introduces a soft sandalwood reminiscent of a tranquil forest breeze. In practice, the sandalwood lingers the longest (a bit similar to LE LABO’s newly released Santal 33?), refined and non-greasy. Compared to SHIRO, the LINC cream has a thicker texture and longer-lasting scent. Downsides: SHIRO’s fragrance can become cloying over time—or, as many say, may smell a bit “cheap.” Best to try it in person if possible. Costco 93% Duck Down Comforter This winter has been one of the colder ones in Japan, so I picked up this duck down comforter while it was on sale at Costco. The biggest change it brought is that the entire winter, getting into bed felt like sinking into a hotel duvet—extremely comfortable. The best thing about down comforters is that they’re warm yet lightweight. The duck down filling is also of high cleanliness with no unpleasant odor whatsoever. I bought the 1 kg version with 95% duck down fill, and there’s also a goose-down option. Regardless of version, all the down is certified by CIL (Comprehensive Sleep Institute), meets RDS international standards, and is processed with Aller G Plus deodorizing and antibacterial treatment. Being able to trust the filling is the biggest reason I recommend it. In Japan, Japanese-made down comforters often cost over ¥100,000 (e.g., Nishikawa). This Costco comforter is a breath of fresh air—affordable, and even discounted during winter. My final purchase price was ¥12,980, making it incredibly cost-effective. Downsides: None so far. Bellroy Lite Duffel Gym Bag This is a gym bag with excellent texture and craftsmanship, supporting two carrying modes: hand-carry and shoulder-carry (with a detachable strap included). The interior is well-organized, with two bottle pockets and two small item pockets; there’s a built-in AirTag pocket; and the bag can be folded down into a compact size when not in use. The capacity is just right for me. The exterior fabric is water-repellent and has successfully protected my belongings through several surprise downpours; the bag itself is lightweight, making it perfect for going back and forth between home and the gym. Downsides: Expensive at full price. No dedicated shoe compartment. As a travel bag, it lacks a strap to secure it onto a suitcase handle. Patagonia Capilene® Cool Daily Shirt Quick-Dry Baselayer Thanks to the fitness habit I mentioned earlier, I tried quite a few base layer brands this year: Lululemon, Mizuno, Arc’teryx, Montbell and so on. After comparing these, the one most worth recommending is Patagonia’s C1 quick-dry. That’s almost stating the obvious—anyone who knows Patagonia a bit probably already knows that one of their must-try products is the Capilene C1 quick-dry series. The reason I recommend it is that it strikes a great balance between price and performance: it feels great to wear, has excellent quick-drying and odor-control capabilities, comes with a tear-off care label, and is reasonably priced. As for other brands, if we ignore price, Arc’teryx’s Konseal Pocket quick-dry series would probably be my top pick. Unfortunately, the price is high enough to buy at least two pieces from other brands, so I’m not including it in the recommendation list. Downside: It does nothing to hide your body shape—any “flaws” will be fully exposed. Kao Steam Eye Mask (Lavender Scent) An old product in new packaging. A friend once randomly gave me one to try, and I’ve been hooked ever since. These Kao steam eye masks have kept me company through many nights, as well as countless breaks on long bus and plane rides. They’re designed as single-use, so they’re very lightweight, easy to carry, and you just toss them after use—super convenient. There is an unscented version, but I still prefer the scented ones, especially lavender and osmanthus; those scents make it easier for me to slip into a relaxed, sleepy state. Of course, this is very subjective, but it works extremely well for me. Downside: None for now. Mitsubishi Uni-ball Zento Sign Pen The magnetic cap is dangerously addictive—you’ll find yourself clicking it open and shut nonstop. The pen itself has a metal body with a matte coating, giving it a premium feel. The newly developed ZENTO ink includes a “POA surfactant,” which reduces friction against paper even further, resulting in an exceptionally smooth writing experience and minimal ghosting. The weight distribution of the pen has also been adjusted so that the center of gravity sits near the web of your hand, making it comfortable even during extended writing sessions. The overall balance is excellent—you can almost feel that “the pen moves with your mind” smoothness the moment you pick it up. Downside: Pricey. If you just want to try the smooth ink, the standard model is enough. THE SUPERIOR LABOR Wallet In my earlier article “Three Years with a Backpack: My Travel Gear List,” I mentioned wanting a short wallet to replace the long one I had been using. My options at the time were RE:FORM and Bellroy, but the former’s material attracts dust easily, while the latter doesn’t fit well with Japan’s coin-heavy payment habits. Just in time for THE SUPERIOR LABOR’s year-end sale, I picked up this classic Japanese-style wallet at a great price. I call it a “Japanese wallet” mainly because of two features (which also made me choose it): First, despite being a bi-fold wallet with limited space, it includes a coin pocket that opens at a wide angle—perfect for Japan’s cash-centered society. In my case I rarely use coins, so I use this pocket to store my AirTag instead. Second, the craftsmanship. This wallet is made from Japanese Black Wagyu leather, often called the “black diamond of the leather world.” It is tanned using the traditional shironameshi method, which avoids chemical agents and instead uses natural materials like shell ash, salt, and oils. The coloring is done with urushi-nuri, a technique that uses lacquer tree sap. Both methods are traditional techniques and very much reflect Japanese craftsmanship philosophy. Downside: Because of the coin-pocket design, the wallet is on the thicker side. As always, here are some food and drink recommendations to wrap up the lifestyle section: IYOSHI COLA Japan’s version of Laoshan Cola: a cola base infused with traditional herbal ingredients, essentially a medicinal-style Coca-Cola. If you enjoy Laoshan Cola, you’ll almost certainly like Iyoshi Cola—the herbal taste is even stronger, and you’ll often find a bit of herbal sediment at the bottom. This is the kind of drink people either absolutely love or flat-out hate. If you’re a fan of herbal flavors, it’s definitely worth a try. Iyoshi Cola has easily become the drink I consume most frequently this year—nothing else even comes close. Downside: Expensive; the distinctive medicinal flavor can be off-putting for some. Tokyo Milk Cheese Factory Cookies One of my favorite snacks this year. They come in a variety of flavors; my personal picks are Truffle & Cheddar (savory-sweet) and Uji Matcha (sweet). The cookies look a bit like Shiroi Koibito, but taste much better: crisp yet not dry, with smooth, layered fillings that never feel cloying. The Truffle & Cheddar flavor has a subtle savory aroma, with the truffle fragrance blending harmoniously—perfect when paired with black tea as an afternoon treat. The Uji Matcha version balances a gentle bitterness with the soft sweetness of mascarpone, resulting in a wonderfully delicate flavor profile. Downside: Uses no animal butter; the ingredient list is noticeably long… Then let’s talk about two things that aren’t practical but add emotional value: Alapaka 9th Anniversary Limited-Edition Patch A limited-edition badge collection released for ALPAKA’s 9th anniversary. The brand invited nine renowned street artists from around the world, each offering their own creative interpretation of ALPAKA’s core theme — “Keep Moving Forward.” Each patch has a completely different style, and I switch them around on my various accessory bags. No deeper reason — they just look cool. We Are Twinkle People I bought some Pop Mart stock earlier this year and sold too early. Recently I discovered that the Twinkle figures are way too cute. When I’m in a bad mood, giving the little Twinkle guy a squish instantly lifts my spirits. No major purpose — just emotional value as a little “gift back” to Pop Mart for that stock. The rest is pure serotonin. This year’s tech section can be summed up as “nothing remarkable.” My usual habit of upgrading my iPhone annually was interrupted — although I did buy the latest iPhone 17 Pro Max, I immediately sold it to a buyback shop. Overall, I’ve hit a “vacuum phase” with electronics, feeling little motivation to replace or upgrade anything throughout the year. DJI Action 5 Pro As I mentioned in My Travel Gear List After Three Years of Backpacking, the main purpose of this purchase was to replace my old GoPro 9 — pairing it with a car mount for road-trip scenery, or a neck mount for hiking and trekking logs. The 30,000-yen purchase price plus points made it a great deal. The compact body is easy to carry, and compared with my old GoPro, the magnetic mounting system saves a lot of hassle during setup and removal Downside: DJI released the Action 6 at the end of this year, making the 5 Pro an older model. Personally, though, I don’t see a strong reason to upgrade. Panasonic ES-PV3A Electric Shaver A frequent appearance in my recommendations this year. Lightweight, long-lasting battery, USB-C charging — all solid selling points. But the real highlight is how incredibly compact it is: super portable without compromising shaving performance. I’ve tried Braun’s foil shavers before, but had to switch back to Philips after developing a nickel allergy to Braun’s foil. Panasonic’s ES-PV3A, however, contains no nickel, and its foil head shaves noticeably cleaner than Philips’ rotary design. It has become an absolute essential for my trips this year. Downside: Zhitai Portable SSD Because of work, I’ve used portable drives from Samsung, SanDisk, LaCie, and others. Earlier this year, I bought my first domestically made portable SSD — the Zhitai. After nearly a year of heavy usage (storing large quantities of photos and videos, long continuous data transfers), it has remained extremely stable and reliable. Compared with Samsung’s T7 series, the Zhitai drive is cheaper and faster. While long-term durability still needs more time to judge, its performance so far has been excellent. The included dual-head data cable and surprisingly good-quality carrying case also add extra value to the overall package. Nitecore EDC23 Flashlight Since rural areas in Japan often lack streetlights — and because I frequently walk mountain roads at night — I still need a compact flashlight for safety. The EDC23’s flat, compact design is highly portable, yet it can instantly burst to 2,500 lumens of brightness. USB-C charging is another major convenience, saving me from carrying a proprietary cable. I also bought two other popular models this year — the SK-05 and Xiaomi’s multifunction portable flashlight. Both perform well, but due to size differences, neither is as convenient to carry as the EDC23, so I’ll leave them out for now. Downside:The 2,550-lumen turbo mode only lasts a few seconds before the flashlight forces a cooldown. Razer Pro Click V2 Ergonomic Mouse I bought this as a replacement for my current Logitech MX Vertical ergonomic mouse. Compared with the MX Vertical, the Pro Click V2 is better suited for users with larger hands. Once you get used to Razer’s grip style, you’ll find that its mold design is more reasonable and comfortable than the MX Vertical. The matte plastic shell is also a huge advantage for someone like me with “acidic hands”—it doesn’t get corroded or damaged by sweat the way the rubber coating on the MX Vertical does. In addition, its DPI is significantly higher than Logitech’s, making cursor movements more responsive and precise, especially on high-resolution monitors or multi-screen setups. Downside:Just like Logitech’s office drivers, Razer’s software is terrible. The mouse also has a built-in RGB light—if you leave it on, battery life drops drastically. When connected via Bluetooth, wake-from-sleep is noticeably slower than Logitech’s. This is both the conclusion and the disclaimer. Everything listed above represents items that I personally selected with great care throughout the year — but my definition of “good products” is entirely subjective. These items are simply what best fit me, not necessarily what will fit everyone. If anything here gives you even a little inspiration, then that alone makes this article worthwhile.

Title: Turkey Still Frozen? How AI Can Rescue Thanksgiving Disasters
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/ronschmelzer/2025/11/26/turkey-still-frozen-how-ai-can-rescue-thanksgiving-disasters/
Time Published: 2025-11-26T19:47:29Z

ByRon Schmelzer, Contributor. Generative AI is quietly becoming a first responder for holiday chaos. Every year someone forgets to thaw the turkey. Or realizes they’re missing nutmeg. Or discovers the mashed potatoes have turned gummy 10 minutes before guests arrive. Thanksgiving disasters are a tradition as ingrained as the cranberry sauce. The difference in 2025 is that many households are turning to AI as an emergency hotline for everything from last-minute menu pivots to oven triage. A 2025 YouGov survey summarized by Brookings reports that 56% of U.S. adults have used AI tools and 28% use them weekly for day-to-day tasks. Consumer studies show that 61% of adults have used AI in the past six months, with nearly 1 in 5 relying on it daily. Families have started using these tools for the same everyday tasks that once fell to harried hosts, including cooking, grocery lists and budgeting. Food preparation is one of the fastest-growing use cases. Research on “AI in the kitchen” suggests about 64% of consumers have already tapped AI for recipe ideas, meal planning or kitchen troubleshooting, according to a study by AskAttest. Rising costs are accelerating the trend. The American Farm Bureau estimates that the average Thanksgiving dinner for 10 now sits around $55.18, down slightly from last year but still well above pre-pandemic levels. Meanwhile, Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows year-over-year food-at-home prices up 2.7%, with meat and poultry costs rising even faster. Putting a holiday meal on the table now requires more planning, more math and more strategy. Overlay that with the chaos of hosting relatives, and the usual scatter-brained nature of planning complex multistep tasks in a compressed time environment, and it is no surprise that generative AI is emerging as a real-time rescue tool. Thanksgiving is more project management than cooking. It requires sequencing dozens of steps under time pressure while navigating unexpected problems. In past years, hosts turned to search engines, frantic group texts or a parent who “always knows what to do.” Search volume spikes each November for terms like “turkey won’t thaw,” “oven schedule Thanksgiving” and “how to fix lumpy gravy.” Today people are leaning on AI for rapid, contextualized judgment calls. AI tools are becoming the triage nurse for exactly these moments, stitching together advice, timelines, substitutions and rescue strategies in seconds. When using AI for Thanksgiving troubleshooting or disaster prevention, context matters even more than during calm planning. Start with a detailed briefing. A well-structured prompt can turn a looming disaster into a manageable adjustment. Here is a flexible prompt template you can use for this purpose: “You are my Thanksgiving kitchen triage assistant. Context: - Number of adults: - Number of kids: - Dietary needs or allergies: - Cooking skill level: - Available equipment (one oven, air fryer, Instant Pot, etc.): Current disaster or problem: [Describe the issue: turkey still frozen, missing an ingredient, side dish failed, running late] Constraints: - Time until guests arrive: - Budget flexibility: - Ingredients on hand: Goal: - Rescue plan with clear steps, backups and timing adjustments.” This level of detail lets AI deliver not just general advice but a survival plan tailored to your challenging kitchen needs. Even under normal conditions, AI can help you plan a menu with built-in safety nets. The trick is to design dishes that minimize points of failure. You can use AI to plan a menu based on risk tolerance. Tell AI if you have a tiny oven, no mixer or only one large pot. It will reshape the menu to avoid collisions that become disasters at 2 p.m. on Thursday. Likewise, if your table includes vegans, gluten-free diners and traditionalists, AI can help consolidate overlapping dishes so you avoid cooking three versions of everything. This reduces the odds of errors like cross-contamination or forgetting an essential side. For example: “Create a Thanksgiving menu for 10 that is low-risk and disaster-resistant. Requirements: - Only one oven. - Limited fridge space. - Beginner skill level. - Dishes should tolerate being made ahead, reheated or held warm.” AI will propose ideas with fewer temperature-sensitive steps, simpler techniques and more flexible ordering. A surprising number of Thanksgiving problems start at the store. Missing ingredients cause last-minute panic. Buying too much creates storage issues. Buying the wrong brand leads to consistency problems. And sometimes your most important ingredient is out of stock or unavailable. AI can step in here to help: “Turn these recipes into a consolidated shopping list. Group by store aisle. Flag ingredients that are easy to forget. Flag high-cost items where substitutions are possible. Identify items I should buy in duplicate to avoid emergencies. Help identify useful crisis prevention features such as: Highlight items prone to stockouts near the holiday and provide alternatives if they are not available Identify ingredients with large price swings Suggest pantry backups (like evaporated milk or broth) Build a 'Thanksgiving emergency kit’ of spices, foil, butter and broth” You can also ask AI to generate a cross-store comparison table so you can plug in prices from Aldi, Walmart, Costco or your local market. The LLMs themselves won’t have access to the most recent prices, however, so this will be a more challenging task. In the near future, expect the AI systems to have live connectors with current pricing so this should be a more trivial ask. The biggest disasters happen in the final three hours before the meal. AI thrives here. Make it your kitchen strategist, using this following prompt to help you get your act together: “You are my Thanksgiving day kitchen scheduler. Menu: [paste recipes] Dinner time: 5 p.m. Constraints: one oven, four burners, an air fryer. Tasks: 1) Build a timeline from 24 hrs before dinner to serving time. 2) Identify critical path steps. 3) Show when oven conflicts will occur and offer alternatives. 4) Suggest prep tasks that reduce chaos. Help me avoid the ‘everything needs 375 degrees F at once’ problem: Given these dishes and their preferred temperatures, create a single-oven plan that avoids temperature changes. Allow minor temperature compromises and note how they affect results.” If something goes wrong, AI can rescue you on the fly. Here are some AI quick-save prompt possibilities based on the disaster. Turkey still frozen at 10 a.m. (You know it needs to be thawed out well in advance, right?): “Act as a highly experienced home cook chef. Please help me with a critical problem I am facing.The turkey is still partially frozen. Dinner is in 6 hours. The turkey weighs 14 pounds. Give me safe, USDA-aligned rapid-thaw options and an adjusted cooking timeline.” Mashed potatoes too gluey? Try the following: “Help! You are my thanksgiving day triage assistant. My mashed potatoes turned gummy. Guests arrive in 30 minutes. Give me a fix using common ingredients.” Stuffing dried out? Try the following prompt: “Acting as a very experienced home cook chef capable of recovering any home cooking problem using commonly available ingredients and supplies.My stuffing is dry and crumbly. How can I rescue it without making it mushy?” AI cannot taste your food, but it can apply known kitchen chemistry and common approaches to rescue most dishes. Thanksgiving overspending is its own form of disaster. The PwC 2025 Holiday Outlook survey reports that about 84% of consumers expect to cut back spending over the next six months because of higher prices and a tougher economic outlook. The same PwC survey notes that 53% of consumers say price increases will likely affect their holiday spending decisions. AI supports budget recovery in several ways. First it can diagnose your menu’s cost centers by analyzing menus and ranking dishes by cost. AI can help suggest ways to reduce total cost by 20% without losing the holiday feel. It can also suggest alternatives for expensive items while maintaining flavor profiles. You still need to sanity-check allergy considerations, but it is a strong starting point. You can also use AI to build a budget strategy after something goes wrong. For example, if a dish burns or ingredients spoil, AI can propose fallback options that stay within your remaining budget. Post-Thanksgiving regret also often stems from having either way too many leftovers or not enough to make the weekend easy. AI can help build a leftovers plan that avoids both. For example, after providing some detail of your menu to an AI system, try the following prompt to help adjust cooking quantities: “Help me plan quantities for seven adults and three kids. We want leftovers for one additional meal only. Give recommended amounts for turkey, sides, and desserts.” Or you can use AI to creatively repurpose your cooking output. AI can reassign ingredients or repurpose partially saved dishes. “I burned half the stuffing. Here is what is left. Create a next-day meal plan using what survived.” Extra points if you provide a photo of the burned side and if AI can generate an image of what the rescued meal would look like. As we become more comfortable and familiar with AI, we all know that we can’t always trust AI outputs. AI can calm panic, but it also makes confident mistakes. Treat it like a smart assistant, not an authority. Always verify cooking temperatures. Use USDA guidelines to confirm poultry temps and resting times. Make sure to check allergy-related substitutions. AI can miss hidden allergens. Double-check any substitution involving nuts, dairy, gluten or soy. Be cautious with timing shortcuts. If a suggestion seems too good to be true, it probably is. Do not rely on AI to reduce safe cooking or cooling times. Just because the LLM confidently says something can be done on a specific time frame doesn’t mean it actually can. This is especially important for thawing, reheating and cooling food. When in doubt, consult USDA, FDA or your local extension office. AI has transitioned from a novelty to a true kitchen command center. It helps troubleshoot thawing issues, prevent oven collisions, salvage failed sides and can keep costs under control. Used well, it reduces stress and increases safety without replacing the heart of the holiday. So even if the turkey is still frozen on Thursday morning, the holiday can be saved, gracefully, safely and with your sanity intact.

Title: How Much Nostalgia Can an MMORPG Franchise Sustain?

Time Published: 2025-11-26T16:15:19Z

Nostalgia can be a powerful influence on people. We all seem to have within us to desire to go back to some illusory “simpler time” when everything was better, more fun, less stressful, and didn’t cost so damn much. The problem is that only one of those items is consistently correct. That doesn’t stop businesses from preying on that desire to turn back the clock, though sometimes it is we, the customers, who end up banging on the door begging to be preyed upon. I think my earliest direct experience with this was Coca-Cola Classic. A registered trade mark of the Coca-Cola Corporation of Atlanta, Georgia Coke, having secured domination of the cola market, was now involved in the “cola wars” where Pepsi, pretender to the cola throne, was doing all it could to chip away and Coke’s market share. For some reason, Coke lost their minds and reformulated Coke to be more like Pepsi, thinking this would put Pepsi in it place. And so we got New Coke, which will live forever in business texts as an example of bad ideas. Coke, seeing their market share drop on the move, introduced Coca-Cola Classic. This set off a mild wave of nostalgia, as the company framed it that way, and we all ran to this new version of Coke and, for a brief time, Coke had even more market share with New Coke and Classic running in parallel. Then most people just picked Classic, sales of New Coke tanked, it was removed from the market, and we were back to just on core version of Coke. After that the company mostly ignore Pepsi and Pepsi scaled back their own costly assault on Coke somewhere around Crystal Pepsi and now we just have flavored versions of either as our variation. Not the last time I would see a nostalgia play, nor a nostalgia play that wore itself out as it simply became the new normal. In particular, for this discussion, there are MMORPGs that seem to rely pretty heavily on nostalgia after a certain point in their life cycle. EverQuest springs pretty readily to mind on that front. The game, coming up on its 27th year in a few months, took its first dip into the nostalgia pool 20 years ago, rolling out the first of what would become a long line of servers promising something akin to the first day experience. But it isn’t just the special servers that try to create a vision of the original. The expansions on the main servers… the “live” servers in EQ parlance, which translated to “retail” over in Azeroth… start to go back to old favorite locations in an attempt to capture a bit of that nostalgia magic. This same thing has been going on with World of Warcraft as well. In fact, Blizz was a little late to the party, taking 15 years to get there when titles that launched after WoW had been there already. But when Blizz finally got there, WoW Classic was a rousing success. It might even be considered a critical moment for the franchise as WoW Classic arrived just in time to save the game… financially at least… from the huge fumble that was the Shadowlands expansion on the retail side of the house. I am probably projecting my personal experience when I say Shadowlands broke the connection with retail for some… but the success of WoW Classic in that moment sealed it as a permanent fixture on the WoW agenda. The problem is that nostalgia is somewhat predicated on that past happy/better/ideal time being unavailable or unreachable. The whole point is that it is something in your personal story that you can no longer do. But what happens when that old experience is suddenly readily available again? What if you know that every spring the EQ team is going to roll out some minor variation on a fresh start, special rules, classic server. What happens when every expansion is going back to some old location? Or, on the WoW side of the street, what happens when you don’t understand that progress in old content is extremely accelerated so you let old expansions sit on the classic server long past their freshness date? What happens when your classic team’s monetization goals mean selling conveniences that were never in the original? What happens when you try to solve the “freshness” problem of old content by just cranking the difficulty dial one way or another while dumping modern features on top of the old content? And WHAT THE HELL happens when your retail team just gives up once and for all on being able to create two years of new content and decides that THEY TOO are going to spend the back stretch of every expansion cycle ALSO running old content, undermining the classic team’s efforts? You want Turtle WoW becoming a thing? This is how you get Turtle WoW becoming a thing! You make everything a blend of classic and suddenly it feels like a beige sameness. The spell is broken and people then want something new to try and reach that classic high. “New Classic” is an oxymoron, yes, but people are complicated and can hold conflicting beliefs. Sure, for a while there, I thought maybe Holly Longdale had unlocked the fountain of eternal youth with classic. But when classic content becomes pervasive, it is no longer classic. There can be no nostalgia when the old version is served up to you constantly… or, rather, nostalgia is defeated when things have changed so much… Dan Olson has a whole side riff on how much different it is to play WoW Classic on modern computers in his Why it’s Rude to Suck at WoW video… that you go there thinking you’ll feel the way you did, and it doesn’t happen. Or it no longer happens. For the first year or so of WoW Classic, it felt enough like the old days and Blizz hadn’t gotten concerned and started modernizing the old experience that I could squint my eyes and get a modest hit of “the good old days” from the game. But like all nostalgia, it is a very perishable product. I didn’t go play Anniversary Classic because it was too soon. The first time only worked because it had been so long since that original content had been playable outside of an emulator that is was great and there were crowds of people and we were all just so happy to be there. Until we weren’t. Now our group is off playing something else. We did WoW Classic and it was good, but even the most powerful nostalgia cannot fix what was broken in the first place. So it was an incredible high in vanilla, followed by a low in Outland… which I didn’t really like back in the day and was also the point when Blizz decided they really needed to monetize this classic stuff more… had a rebound in Northrend, and then died in the cataclysm, just like it did the first time around. I guess full points for recreating the original experience, but also I am no longer a subscriber. And EQ has it even worse. They’ve been putting out the special server thing for so long now that it is no longer special. There seems to be no setting of the dials that they have easy access to that will excite their installed base, and keeping them engaged is a critical part of their own business plan, a plan that wasn’t going so well at the last report, to the extent that EG7’s largest shareholder, Eros Capital Partners, has a list of demands including a new board of directors, more stock buybacks to bolster the share price, and maybe even bringing the whole place private again so they can loot the company without the watchful eye of regulators getting involved. What do you do when the nostalgia well runs dry? Yes, this is where we get to Classic Plus and like dreams. The problem is that the EverQuest team simply doesn’t have the bandwidth to work on a new content creation path for the company’s foundational title. And if things continue to decline for EQ, they are likely going to have to make do with an even smaller team. Meanwhile, the World of Warcraft team could almost certainly find the staff to do something along those lines. Season of Discovery proved they could change up at least some of the vanilla experience. But my outsider opinion, having watched them for so many years, is that there is no internal champion capable of driving such a project. They always had the public company problem when Bobby Kotick was running the show, but they now have that in spades with Phil and Satya so obviously willing to slash and burn the second their bonuses might be in jeopardy. This is where Old School RuneScape is the outlier. Jagex has had a horrible time trying to develop another title. It feels like RuneScape is all the magic they had in them. But when they too went to the nostalgia well, they somehow found it within themselves to create a new path forward, different from RuneScape’s, to follow. This again, however, points out the hollow nature of nostalgia as a business plan. People want to “feel” like they did back in the day, but in the attempt they often find that simply going back to a game in their current state of mind will not fulfill that need. In the end, even Old School RuneScape failed the nostalgia test in the end. In going back to that, the players who embraced the old style of play quickly settled in and it became normal. It was Coca-Cola Classic just becoming Coke for that group. To keep them engaged, there had to be more, a hook, something fresh to keep those players happy. Nostalgia is a gimmick. A tease. A hook to grab attention. But Nostalgia alone is not sustainable, in part because we have all moved on from those times. We are different people in a changed world and the context that made something great at one moment leaves it feeling hollow now. For my final example, just to seal the deal on that idea, I am going to fall back to the Atari 2600. As I wrote years back, I wanted that more than anything in the world back in 1977. And I played the hell out of that console once I had it. But it doesn’t interest me today despite whatever investment group that holds the Atari name tries to tempt me with. That is a console that has been beaten to death when it comes to nostalgia. The history of the 2600 these days is 6 years of success, and 22 years of trying to remind me how cool it was back in 1977. There has been no point in time since the mid-90s when I could not have bought a software version or a reworked, cost reduced, hardware copy of the original, to the point that I wonder who is left to even purchase such a thing. Then again, I suppose they wouldn’t keep remaking if nobody was buying them. But they always seem to show up around the holidays, when nostalgia is often at its peak and many adults are internally struggling with the fact that none of it is as much fun as when they were a kid. And then they see a stack of the latest round of 2600 remakes sitting on a pallet at Costco, and they cave to the temptation in their state of weakness. I mean, I know better and it almost works on me every year… almost. Yeah, I love that Dan Olsen video. His comment about going back and betting on the Cubs in 2016 and smashing in high school when you had the chance as a way to relive your past really hits home, because it also highlights just how far away that I am from my own high school experience for 2016 to be about my kids’ high school experience. (If my kids did smash when they got the chance back in high school, I think I’m happy with not knowing.) Still, Dan was right in that you really can’t go home again, and my form of rebellion in Wrath Classic was to simply refuse to get on the treadmill and do all the things I never got to do back in 2009-2010. I suppose in my own way I was deliberately choosing to suck at Warcraft as a big middle finger to the Classic Community. As far as the Atari (and other classic 8-bit systems) goes, I still have a working console in the basement, along with an Intellivision. (I have NO idea if the TI-99 4/A still works, as I haven’t powered it on in 30 years, but it probably does.) The one thing that keeps me from playing them is adapting them to fit a modern television. I’ve done some investigations from time to time, but the solutions commonly found on Amazon don’t exactly thrill me (I don’t trust the companies behind them when I can’t find any information about them online.) I may have to build something myself, or at the very least degauss the RCA CRT television we still have loitering around to get it up and running. LikeLike My strange variant on this is that the older I get, the less interested in revisiting my past I become but the more interested I am in anything that feels genuinely new. It gets harder and harder to find anything in just about any medium to which my immediate, unfiltered reaction isn’t “Oh, that reminds me of…” or even worse “Oh, that’s exactly like…”. I do still get a buzz out of revisiting old things but nowadays even that usually means old things I missed when they were new. New-to-me is the baseline of what makes me excited now. That’s why I’m a lot more interested in the upcoming EQII expansion, even though it will really just be more of the same, than I will be in whatever retro-server they try to drum up fading interest for next summer. At least the expansion will look new, even if it plays exactly the same. I do think Darkpaw is about done with the TLE server trick, though. They’ve made it last way longer than it had any right to so they can hardly complain but it can’t go on forever. EG7/DBG really need to come up with a new idea for the EQ IP soon, even if a whole new game is beyond them at this point. Maybe AI will save them… LikeLike (Re-posting this comment because the first just vanished. Please delete as necessary!) My strange variant on this is that the older I get, the less interested in revisiting my past I become but the more interested I am in anything that feels genuinely new.

EG7/DBG really need to come up with a new idea for the EQ IP soon, even if a whole new game is beyond them at this point. Maybe AI will save them… LikeLike I truly delighted in WoW the first time around. it was all new to me, it was progress, it was definitely Wow. By the time they began messing with it, the game had shifted, and you were no longer in control of where you could go; the fights were easier, or non existent, and your trips ‘back home’ were stunningly sad. There was no back home. The story line changed, and the challenges that went with discovery the first time were now yawn inducing ‘oh yeah, I remember this” events. This, to me, is where WoW failed. It told the truth. You can’t go home again, because someone else lives there, the neighbors are gone, and that neat tree in the backyard has been replaced with a horse stall. Even when you know (or think you do) what’s around the bend, you’re braced for one event, only to face a different one. No more challenges. LikeLike I would really like a can of Crystal Pepsi for nostalgia’s sake, now that you’ve reminded me. The sensation I had when I tried it for the first (and, I believe only) time was very fascinating. My brain was like “Aaaaaahhhh, it looks like soda, but smells and tastes like Pepsi, what the hell is going on???” Of course, as with almost all kinds of nostalgia, that, too, would probably get old pretty fast. LikeLike I am far from immune to nostalgia, but the surprising thing to me about WoW Classic was how actually good a game it was back then. Rough edges, sure, but mostly quibbles. Nostalgia brought me to the party, the quality kept me there. But one can only play a given game so much before anything gets old. I hope for their sake they aren’t shifting the same diminishing player base around but actually bringing some new blood still. No amount of remixing will help if that isn’t the case. LikeLike I used to get frustrated with revisiting things because nothing ever seemed right or fun until I realized that it was me. I came to the conclusion that nostalgia is just me wanting to be a tourist among my past memories. That trying to live in the past is just going to be a disappointment/disaster. Once I understood that about myself I found I could have fun with nostalgic things. As far as gaming nostalgia goes, while I never played EQ (or EQ 2) in any serious fashion it has been fun to talk to and read people’s reactions about the progression servers. I get a sense that having a steady stream of them works well because there is enough people that like to drop in and experience the way things were for a time. After they get their fill they generally move on and and a new casual group starts up with the next server. With Wow I’m waiting until they feel the need to have a Chromie time version of Classic available for leveling in Retail. They’ve made a few steps towards making things from Classic available again in Retail, but that deep, rich vein of making all of Classic doable with Retail systems is waiting for them to break the glass. LikeLike Nostalgia is brain poison for old people. I have very fond memories of the blizzard of (Jan) 1996, of doing snow angels in the snow in front of the apartment bldg with my new wife. Great memory, full of joy. Good times, right? But I also remember that back then we were pretty poor, recently out of college, with debt and living in the cheapest neighborhood we could find. I have a very unpleasant memory of sitting down one time with $4.75, all we had, and budgeting it out to last three days til payday. Right down to how many subway tokens we needed and what ramen and cans of food we could get at the bodega. The walk to the train was so dicey at night I’d walk my wife there (night shift) and then go home and collapse into bed (day shift for me). In other words, it actually kind of sucked back then. I watched Halloween a few years ago and couldn’t believe how bad it was. It was one of my favorite movies when I was young. The acting, especially the dialogue, is so bad it sounds like a fourth grade play. If it wasn’t for the fame and “nostalgia” it would be unwatchable. I went to one of those arcade-bars a few years ago. So cool, you can play all these games while having access to the bar! And now I’m older, so I can afford to play any game(s) I want! You can guess what happened. You play Space Invaders, Asteroids, etc., a few times, and realize they’re kind of primitive and boring and only good for a day full of fun if current technology presents nothing better and you’re a kid with less options than an adult. The entire array of games held my attention for about 30 minutes and then it was just another bar. Brain poison. LikeLike “The history of the 2600 these days is 6 years of success, and 22 years of trying to remind me how cool it was back in 1977.” Oh, yes. As far as MMO nostalgia goes, you can go back to the old content, but you can’t go back to the you that had no idea what was going on. LikeLike In a real sense it’s like rereading a book, or rewatching an old film or TV show. I can never be the young me discovering Tolkien for the first time. I can still read LotR as the much older me because I find ways of still enjoying it. Like I can play *insert old game* quite merrily, but I approach it very differently now to then. To get value now I have to remember I’m in the back half of my forties. As Tips says, you can’t go back to the old you; but as Pallais says you can (or I can) sometimes frame things that accounts for that and allows one to enjoy the nostalgia. LikeLike That is a distinction I could have made more clear, because the other direction, the “everything old is bad, newer is always better” idea is flawed in its own way. A lifetime in Silicon Valley has proven that. I still play a lot of older games because they were good. WoW Classic was a lot of fun as a game, even absent the nostalgia aspect. There is probably a whole post to be written (again) about how expansions are an attempt to keep the party going that can wear things thin while stealing fun from the original.

When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. Cyber Monday is here, and there are lots of deals to choose from, including these excellent discounts on the Apple products we recommend: Today’s best Apple deals: U.S. Today’s best Apple deals: U.K. Updated December 1: We have reviewed the best prices and found more price drops and changes. We will be regularly monitoring the best prices and will update this article throughout Cyber Monday. ‘Tis the season for savings! Whether you’re looking for a deal on an iPad, Mac, iPhone, Apple Watch, AirPods, or anything else Apple sells, there’s no better time to get one for cheap than Black Friday. The annual shopping extravaganza officially kicked off on Friday, but many of the best deals will last until today, AKA Cyber Monday on December 1. Every retailer that sells Apple gear gets in on the fun, and we are rounding up only the best deals we find right here. We regularly check prices using various tools to get a view of the very best prices right now, compared to what they were over the past days, weeks, and months, so we know an excellent deal when we see it. We’re checking and updating these prices all weekend, so mark this page and return often so you don’t miss a good deal, some of which are short-lived. Even Apple runs its own Black Friday shopping event, where it offers gift cards on certain purchases, including $50 with AirPods Pro 3, $100 for iPad Air, and $250 with a MacBook Pro. The bottom line is that there are lots of deals to be found right now, so no matter what Apple device you’re looking for, you will be able to make a saving. So take a look at the deals on all of Apple’s products below. Also, check our Best Picks round-ups, where you can find reviews of all the products we recommend. At Macworld we’ve been covering and reviewing Apple and Apple devices for more than 40 years, from the original Macintosh to the most recent M5 MacBook Pro and iPhone 17 lineup. We use Apple products every day and purchase them with our own money, so we know a good deal when we see one. More importantly, we also know how to spot a bad deal. With a working knowledge of everything Apple sells and decades of experience, we know when stores are inflating prices or pushing “normal” sales as limited Black Friday deals, so the listings you see here will only be for discounts that are at or near all-time low prices. Macworld Cyber Monday tip: While shopping during the Black Friday sales, we’ve noticed that on Amazon, if you delay your delivery date, there are additional 2-3% savings to be had. This doesn’t apply to every Apple product, unfortunately, but we have seen the additional 3% applied to AirTags, and if you have lots of other eligible products in your shopping cart, then it can add up to decent savings. Apple released the new M5 MacBook Pro in October, but still sells M4 Pro and M4 Max models as well as the M4 MacBook Air. The new M5 model is mostly a chip refresh, but it’s a great one, as we said in our 4.5-star review, and right now you can get $250 off all the 14-inch M5 MacBook Pro at Amazon, taking it $50 lower than last Thursday and down to the lowest price we have seen. However, even though the new model brings a major boost in GPU and SSD performance, we also loved the M4 model, and you can get an amazing $300 off the M4 MacBook Pro at Amazon. There are also some excellent deals on the even more powerful MacBook Pro M4 Pro and M4 Max, which are full on workstations now at amazingly low prices, such as $300 off the 14-inch M4 Pro MacBook Pro at Amazon, and a whopping $500 off the 16-inch M4 Max MacBook Pro, also at Amazon. You can find more deals below. And, of course, the MacBook Air is a fantastic option for just about anyone, earning an extremely rare 5-star score in our testing. You can get $250 off the MacBook Air at Amazon. U.K. shoppers don’t miss out either, with £184 off a 13-inch MacBook Air at Amazon. £200 off the M5 MacBook Pro at KRCS, and £349 off the M4 Pro MacBook Pro at Amazon. See even more great deals below. Foundry U.S. U.K. The iMac and Mac mini received an M4 update in October 2024, with the Mac mini also getting a dramatic redesign that shrunk the case down to just 5 inches. We loved the new Mac mini design and M4 chip and there is $120 off at Amazon. The Mac mini M4 Pro version is a great low-cost way to get a really powerful Mac, and with $150 off it’s a good saving (but it was $200 earlier in the Black Friday sale). We don’t know when they will be getting M5 chips, but if they are, they won’t arrive until 2026, so we recommend picking up one of these deals if you’re looking for a Mac desktop. U.K. users should take advantage of £100 off the Mac mini, and £130 off the Mac mini pro. Simon Jary / Foundry U.S. U.K. Apple released the AirPods Pro 3 in September 2025, with a slightly new design, foam-infused eartips, and a heart-rate sensor. We gave them a near-perfect score in our review, but also noted that it’s a relatively small upgrade over the AirPods Pro 2, which has the same H2 chip and many similar features. The new model has the same $249 MSRP in the U.S. and a slightly lower £219 RRP in the U.K. (AirPods Pro 2 were £229), so keep that in mind when shopping. We don’t expect to see AirPods Pro 3 with more than $30-$50 off, but the older AirPods Pro 2 did dip as low as $139 at Walmart, but that deal seems to have ended now, the next best option is $189 on Amazon. The AirPods 4 have been out for over a year, but are still a fantastic pair of earbuds. The Black Friday deals of $69 for AirPods 4 was superb, but stock seems to have run out now (check to see if the model is user). You can still get AirPods 4 with active noise cancellation for less than $100, which is an excellent deal. If you need a pair, grab one, just beware that AirPods deals sell out quickly, but do keep checking because stock seems to come and go. See more U.S. AirPods deals below. U.K. readers can save money on the AirPods Pro 2, currently at £169 with Argos, but we’ve also seen them at that price on Amazon (but they go out of stock quickly!). Right now you can also get £20 off the AirPods 4, bringing the price under £100. See more U.K. AirPods deals below. Petter Ahrnstedt U.S. U.K. Mike Sawh Apple launched the Apple Watch Series 11 in September, but there aren’t many exclusive new features beyond better battery life and 5G networking. The two new health features, hypertension alerts and Sleep Score, are also available on the Series 10, and there isn’t a new color this year. As we noted in our review, we don’t think Series 9 or 10 users need to upgrade. We are seeing savings of $60 on the Series 11, which is a great price for such a full-featured watch, but with $150 off the Series 10 you might want to consider that, you won’t miss out on much (See our comparison of every Apple Watch). The sleeper hit of the new Apple Watch lineup is the SE 3, which got the biggest update of all three models, gaining an always-on display, temperature sensor, a faster chip, on-device Siri, and fast charging. We gave it a near-perfect score of 4.5 stars and highly recommend it at full price—for $50 off, it’s a no-brainer decision. At the high end, the Ultra 3 has a slightly larger screen, satellite connectivity, and longer battery life compared to last year’s model. We’ve seen $150 off, but if you want one, we’d recommend this $599 deal on the Ultra 2 instead. U.S. U.K. In the U.K. the deals are small on the newest Apple Watch models, but we anticipate that they will improve once Black Friday is here. And if they don’t our advice would be to snap up Apple’s offer, which will get you a £40 gift card. The biggest deals on offer right now are on the older models. We’d recommend Argos’s £200 off the Apple Watch Ultra 2 and Curry’s £130 off the Apple Watch Series 10. Just keep in mind that in the U.K., Apple cut the Apple Watch Series 11 and Ultra 3 prices by £30 and £50 compared to the previous generation when they were introduced. Keep this in mind when shopping, because some stores might make savings appear to be larger than they actually are. Apple updated the iPad Air with an M3 chip and the iPad Pro with an M5 chip this year. Neither update brings any huge reason to upgrade, but they’re both excellent tablets. It comes down to preference and budget—if you’re largely using your tablet for consumption (streaming, surfing, games), get an Air, for which we are seeing prices cut by $150, but if you have real work to do on it, get the Pro: you can get $100 off the M5 iPad Pro in the U.S. which is a great deal on such a new device. The mini hasn’t had a meaningful update in a couple of generations. But as we noted in our review, it’s still the best tablet for its size and a great option for anyone who values ultra portability over screen size. There’s a decent $100 off. The standard entry-level iPad A16 is an absolute steal at its Black Friday price of $275, but stock is dwindling, so if you want one act fast. Foundry U.S. U.K. We’re seeing a great £100 saving on the iPad Air, but the deals on the other iPads in the U.K. aren’t as big as they are in the U.S. The M5 iPad Pro only has a small saving, so right now we are looking at the older models to get a better discount. With that in mind, we’d recommend the M4 iPad Pro if you can find one (it’s £206 off at Amazon, but selling out fast). Apple has a great deal on for Black Friday that will run through to December 1, 2025. You can subscribe for six months for just $5.99/£4.99 a month! That’s half price! Read more here: Get Apple TV for just $6 per month. David Price / Foundry Most iPhone deals in the U.S. are through carriers and require a trade-in or adding a new line. Carriers will likely have enticing deals with trade-ins as well, but be wary of long-term contracts and terms. One opportunity worth considering is Apple’s Black Friday deal: You can buy an iPhone from Apple and get a gift voucher: In the U.K. there are less limitations on the sale of iPhones so you will be able to pick one up unlocked at a discount if you would prefer to buy an iPhone up front, rather than on a contract. Apple only launched the iPhone 17 lineup in September, so it’s a surprise that we are seeing £100 off the iPhone Air. The iPhone 16e also has £100 off at Amazon: a good saving. Also be on the look out for deals (like this one from AO) on the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max which are no longer sold by Apple but would offer a good option to those who appreciate the extra camera on the Pro iPhone models but can’t stretch to the iPhone 17 Pro. We’d suggest that when it comes to the other deals you should weigh them up against Apple’s own giveaway, where you could get £60 or £40 vouchers with the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, or iPhone 16e, respectively. For example, £100 off an iPhone 16e is better than Apple’s £40 voucher, but AO’s £55 off iPhone 16 (128GB) (which has run out now) doesn’t match Apple’s £60 voucher deal so it would be worth waiting to see it that goes lower. These are the best deals we’ve seen so far: There are lots more Apple products you can buy to go with your new Mac, iPhone, or iPad.

Beef prices are going up. Per recent reporting from Fox Business, industry leaders anticipate a top cost of $10 per pound by 2026. Yet, people's craving and appreciation for steak isn't going anywhere. Rather than heading out to a steakhouse (where business is, admittedly, also booming), many consumers are looking to their local grocery stores for steaks to prepare at home. It's easy to walk into a grocery store and find a full list of different cuts of steak, but what's less straightforward is assessing quality while shopping. Truth be told, some grocery stores are better to buy steak from than others. When compiling this guide to steak quality by grocery chains, we identified the in-house steaks brands each grocery chain sources and sells as private label items. Beef or meat brands with larger footprints (take Tyson, for example) didn't factor in very heavily. We also took into consideration whether or not a chain has significant offerings from local or small-scale beef producers as well. Mostly, this guide centers on how shoppers feel about these private label steaks from popular grocery chains. Kicking off our list of best grocery store steak selections is the one and only: Kroger. Synonymous with Midwestern groceries, Kroger is the go-to store for a large portion of the American population. Luckily, it's also home to one of the highest-quality lines of steak from any grocery chain — the Kroger Simple Truth and Simple Truth Organic line. Simple Truth, one of the store's private labels, uses beef sourced from Uruguay, which has a more favorable climate for grass-fed and finished cows to graze on year-round. With Simple Truth, the livestock has a diet that is almost exclusively grass. Kroger refrains from using beef where hormones or antibiotics have been administered, resulting in natural meat without sacrificing flavor. In Uruguay, much of the cattle are Aberdeen Angus or Hereford cows. The latter is a hardy breed, while the former is known for superior marbling. You can widely see the difference in the quality of product Kroger sells. Although the reviews on its in-house branded steaks are mixed depending on the store, the Private Selection is reviewed well across the board, reaching at least three and a half stars on each steak (with many rated between four and five stars). The chain offers a variety of different cuts, including choice beef shoulder steak, top round London broil beef steak, beef choice skirt steak, sirloin tip beef, choice tailless beef strip steak, T-bone steak, eye of round beef steak, and cubed beef steak. It may not be the very best steak available in grocery stores, but it's well above most others and is deserving of a try next time you find yourself in one of the many Kroger locations. Trader Joe's, known for its eclectic inventory and cheap pricing, is also home to some of the best-quality steaks you'll find in grocery stores. Although the cuts Trader Joe's has carried have always contained a solid amount of USDA Choice graded slabs, it has updated its selection to be even better. As of 2025, its stock has been updated to include filet mignon, ribeye, and New York strip steaks (all of which are graded as the second-highest grade for meat possible: Choice). The store also offers selections between pure pre-packaged cuts, organic grass-fed angus, and pre-marinated cuts (including, but not limited to, craft beer sirloin, carne asada, balsamic rosemary, and sesame teriyaki). It give the meat selection a versatility no matter what the meal you're making, with options that can fit many styles of cooking. While it may not have quite as high a quality as a store like Costco (which has its own processing and packaging process), for the value and size of steaks that Trader Joe's offers, it's one of the best deals on steak in any grocery store. According to shoppers, the lean tenderness of filet mignon and craft beer sirloin are the best options, as they both have solid five-star reviews. Shoppers in the Reddit group r/traderjoes agree that the store's steak is better than most other grocers. While steak may not be the first thing you think of when hearing of Trader Joe's, it should absolutely be one of the first things you put in your cart on your next visit. Publix grocery store (found primarily in the southeast) makes a comittment to supporting local farmers, and regularly procures meat from regional ranches. Sources are found from beef purveyors like Prestage Farm of North Carolina, and White Oak Pastures in Bluffton, Georgia. Nationally, it receives beef from Verde Farms, a regenerative farming-focused operation, which emphasizes environmental preservation and humane treatment of livestock. The store's meat counters are regularly stocked with a multitude of USDA Choice-graded cuts. The quality comes through in the house brand, GreenWise private label, and the line of meat sold under it. The animals raised for the GreenWise program are fed exclusively vegetarian diets, with no added hormones or antibiotics, resulting in more succulent meats packed with flavor. This, in large part, is due to its local sourcing, as Although the brand sells a variety of meats, including different kinds and variations of chicken, turkey, pork, and lamb, the steak is the clear standout, as its flavor is consistently second-to-none. While the store's website doesn't offer customer reviews for its particular products, the Reddit group r/publix concurs that the steak is of better quality than similar stores, and the store itself largely receives high ratings on Yelp. While Costco is generally known as a place to get bulk items for much cheaper prices, it has some departments that stand out for consistently having quality items (such as whiskies) that some customers go specifically to find. Its meat selection, particularly its steaks, fits perfectly in this category, as customers are always treated to a wide selection of high-quality cuts. USDA Prime (the highest quality beef can achieve) cuts are abundant and are defined by more marbling, tenderness, and flavor than USDA Choice or Select. While Costco sources its veal from Atlantic Veal and Lamb of New York (a source from more than 100 American farms), its beef primarily comes from California farmers in the San Joaquin Valley. It also sources from Iowa Premium and Snake River Farms, the former of which sources from over 1,200 local farmers, and the latter provides quality wagyu beef. Costco does not stock organic beef that's been fed hormones and/or antibiotics, but this isn't the biggest driver of their meat. The store uses a blade tenderizer when working its steaks, which (aside from a more thorough tenderization) severs the muscle and tissue more cleanly than other processes. This creates cleaner and better quality cuts, which leads to better quality steaks (even if they source their beef from similar places as their competitors) that are consistently rated four stars or more by their customers. One of the more common grocery stores in America, Meijer offers a high-quality steak selection to a wide customer base. The chain sources its meats from Certified Angus Beef, Purely Meat, Grass Run Farms, Niman Ranch, Pre Brands, and other regional-based distributors, which has led to consistently well-reviewed cuts by their customers. When visiting the website, almost every cut of steak has a rating of four stars or higher (out of five). Both Certified Angus Beef and Purely Meat are major factors in the higher quality of Meijer's steaks, as the latter helped not only to keep operations moving during COVID-19 (when many other suppliers were shut down), but to raise the overall quality of the meat the store carries. As of today, the store carries some of the most consistently highly rated steaks of any grocer. With there being Meijer locations across the country, you can't go wrong stopping in for some sincerely splendid slabs of steak. Known for its cheap prices compared to its competitors, Aldi doesn't let this keep it from stocking its shelves with quality products. Aldi steak, for example, comes in multiple delicious cuts that can be found for noticeably cheaper than similar cuts at other stores. This isn't because its beef is of worse quality, but that Aldi has carved out a way to obtain and package meat that goes around the issues their competitors face. For example, per Daily Meal rather than sourcing all its meat for stores from one or a small few places, Aldi opts to obtain meat from local farms and distributors. Doing so helps to avoid the costs that go along with shipping, as well as to avoid any added preservatives. The store also stocks private-label products for a large portion of its meat selection, which means it orders meat from a third-party source and sells it under its own name. This helps to reduce costs for things such as marketing, paying an in-house butcher, and (again) shipping and the maintenance associated with it, as well as allowing more specificity when placing orders. Although Aldi's lower meat prices can cause skepticism over the quality of its products, its steak is not to be missed. Despite the store not providing direct customer feedback for individual items on its site, its steak is regularly considered to be high quality by shoppers (despite its lower price tag). Some on Reddit have even called the marbling of Aldi steak "supreme." Sprouts is the banner holder of a more uniquely granola-type of grocery store, and that brings in many shoppers, who choose it religiously. Although all its food is high quality, the steak selection is the best of any grocery store in America. It sources its steak from Grass Run Farms, which provides grass-fed Angus steaks that are more marbled and succulent than your typical grocer's in-house steaks. Sprouts offers a selection of grass-fed, pasture-raised, and pre-prepared/ready-to-cook varieties, while emphasizing fresh, not frozen, meat, and a butcher counter that can assist with any questions or requests that you may have. Sprouts ranked as Tasting Table's top grocery store for meat for a reason, as the care to both source the best meat and provide the best cuts to its customers has resulted in the best overall selection of any grocery store. We've even recommended that Sprouts be your go-to for all meats, not just steak, which lends to the overall quality of the store. Its selections include a variety of cuts for whatever you may be making, including from the chuck/brisket/shank, the ribs/plate, the loin/flank, and the round/top round. While there is a bit more effort required to acquire a cut of steak from Sprouts (due to the higher pricing and lack of store presence outside the Southern states), it's well worth it, as these are some of the best cuts available in grocery stores today and have an overwhelming majority of five-star reviews on most of their in-house steaks. Each selection on this list has to be the store's own brand or label, and not products that can specifically be found in other stores. So while stores may source from the same suppliers, each store has its own processing/packaging processes that contribute to the varying qualities between different stores. They also had to be generally well reviewed by customers, so if a store has one or two cuts of steaks that are highly rated, but most are rated three stars or less, then it would not be included. Conversely, if a store has certain cuts that have been occasionally rated negatively, but that are widely well reviewed by customers, it isn't entirely discounted from being included. As mentioned, each store has its own processes for steak procurement and processing, which will lead to the inevitable missteps from time to time. The stores included in this list were ranked based on where and how they source meats, overall customer reviews, and (when necessary) value provided to the customer compared to competitors.
