Title: Celebrate Labor Day with these awesome (electric) work truck deals

It’s Labor Day weekend, which means big deals on car lots across America – especially if you’re shopping for a new electric vehicle to help with your labor. We’ve rounded up the best offers on electric pickups, vans, and even a great option for ride share drivers! Sure, there’s a bit of irony in pitching “work vehicles” on a holiday meant for not working – but for many small business owners, work is part of who they are. And with the $7,500 federal EV tax credit set to expire, plus a wave of great Labor Day deals on work-ready EVs, now might be the best time yet to plug into a new electric ride. Here are some of the standout electric vehicles offers we found this Labor Day weekend (2025), organized by vehicle type. The “Ford for America,” summer sales event continues through Labor Day with interest-free 0% financing, $0 down payment, and zero payments for up to 90 days for retail customers. Ford is also throwing in $0 maintenance for 24 months. But wait, there’s more! Ford Authority is reporting that a complimentary home charger and standard installation might also be included as part of the Ford Power Promise promotion happening at participating dealers in select markets with the purchase of a new F-150 Lightning pickup through the end of September. Lease customers aren’t being left out, either. You can lease a 2025 Ford F-150 Lightning XLT 4P 311A pickup at $399 per month for 36 months, with “just” $399 due at signing (basically your first month’s payment). The best electric vehicle deal in the business keeps on truckin’ into Labor Day weekend, with new 2025 Brightdrop models currently eligible for up to $21,500 in manufacturer rebates before any Federal, state, local utility, or even Costco membership incentives kick in. For your money, you get a capable, Ultium-based electric cargo van with more room than your college dorm and a nationwide dealer network to keep it up and running when you need it most. Despite being based on the company’s existing diesel platform, Mercedes’ eSprinter has proven itself a capable urban hauler in the hands of Amazon, DHL, and countless European tradespeople. Despite that, there are still a handful of leftover 2024 models hanging around dealer lots – enough that Mercedes is offering up to $30,000 (!) Customer Cash on any new ’24MY eSprinter purchased from dealer stock. That discount is enough to bring the price of this 2024 eSprinter in Chicago from $87,823 all the way down to $57,823 this Labor Day weekend – and that’s before you factor in state and local utility incentives that can bring the price down even further. As you can imagine, there’s some fine print on that Customer Cash deal. It can’t be combined with Special APR programs through Mercedes-Benz Financial Services (MBFS), but it can be combined with the Mercedes-Benz Commercial Vehicles Medium Fleet Program. Ride share drivers looking for comfortable seats, room for five adults and their luggage, proven battery life, and lickety-quick charging speeds can stop looking. Volkswagen is offering a sweet ID.4 lease at nearly half the cost of an entry-level Jetta with payments starting at just $129/mo. – that’s despite the ID.4 carrying a significantly higher MSRP. And, while we’re at it, it’s probably worth noting that serious road warriors will probably save more than $129/mo. in fuel alone. If you prefer to own your vehicles after making payments on them for a few years, you can also get 0% interest financing on select ID.4s for up to 72 months. It’s important to note here that Volkswagen’s deals can vary wildly by region. That $129/mo. offer is available in California and a few other West Coast states, for example, but the electric crossover’s listed at $329 for 24 months with $4,499 due at signing in others. Disclaimer: the vehicle models and financing deals above were sourced from CarsDirect, CarEdge, and (where mentioned) the OEM websites – and were current as of 29AUG2025. These deals may not be available in every market, with every discount, or for every buyer (the standard “with approved credit” fine print should be considered implied).

Title: Plant-Based Savings: Cut Grocery Bills 19% in 15 Minutes

Got 15 minutes and a wallet that's feeling a little light? Here's how to slash your grocery bills while eating amazing plant-based meals. Research shows that switching to a whole-food vegan diet can cut food costs by 19 percentâthat's about $650 in savings per year. The secret isn't complicated: plant-based staples like brown rice, potatoes, and beans are some of the cheapest and healthiest ingredients in the supermarket. Plus, inflation has hit meat at nearly twice the rate of vegetables, making this the perfect time to master these money-saving plant-based hacks. The foundation of budget vegan cooking lies in stocking up on versatile, shelf-stable ingredients that work in dozens of recipes. Dried beans and rice are ridiculously cheap and often overlookedâa 5-pound bag of brown rice plus 2 pounds of frozen broccoli costs about $6 and lasts for weeks. Buying staples in bulk is huge, since these ingredients can transform into burgers, taco fillings, hummus, and much more. Plant proteins like beans, lentils, and tofu are economical choices that pack serious nutrition without the premium price tag. Here's where smart pantry building gets interesting: focus on ingredients that multitask across cuisines. That same cup of brown rice gives you 5 grams of protein and 3.5 grams of fiber, and when you combine that with half a cup of broccoli, you're up to 7 grams of protein and 5.5 grams of fiber. But the real magic happens when you learn to season these basics differentlyâcumin and lime for Mexican bowls, ginger and soy for Asian stir-fries, or herbs and lemon for Mediterranean grain salads. Pro tip: Hit up Asian or Latin grocery stores for bulk rice, grains, and spices at unbeatable prices. Stock your freezer with frozen vegetablesâthey're flash-frozen at peak ripeness to retain nutrients and cost a fraction of fresh out-of-season produce. Planning isn't just about organizationâit's your secret weapon against impulse buys and food waste. Taking a few minutes before your store trip to map out meals and compile a shopping list saves both time and money. Plan meals around affordable staples like rice, beans, lentils, and seasonal vegetables, then build variety around those base ingredients. Budget-friendly couples have managed to eat for just $15 Canadian per dayâthat's less than $2.50 per meal by focusing on smart planning. The brilliant thing about strategic planning is how it actually unlocks creativity rather than limiting it. When you know you've got rice, black beans, and frozen corn as your weekly foundation, you can transform them with different spice blends: Monday gets Mexican flair with cumin and lime, Wednesday goes Asian with ginger and soy sauce, Friday turns Mediterranean with herbs and lemon. This rotation strategy means you're buying the same affordable base ingredients but never eating boring meals. Build your weekly menu around one-pot meals, grain bowls, and soups that stretch ingredients into multiple servings. Batch cooking is perfect for bulk ingredientsâcook once and you're set for days, saving time you could use for side gigs or just relaxing. Your shopping strategy can make or break your budget. Choose store brands over name brandsâthey're often identical products for a fraction of the cost. Shop the perimeter where whole foods like fresh produce, grains, and legumes live, avoiding the expensive processed foods in center aisles. Embrace "ugly" vegetablesâthat imperfect carrot is just as nutritious as the pristine one but costs way less. Timing your shopping trips strategically can unlock serious savings most people miss entirely. Shop early weekday mornings when stores are fully stocked and crowds are minimal. Focus on seasonal produce when it's abundant and naturally cheaperâsummer squash in July, root vegetables in fall, citrus in winter. Use apps like "Our Groceries" that allow multiple users to update the same listâperfect for couples, roommates, or families who want to coordinate their shopping without duplicate purchases. Shopping rotation hack: Get to know different stores' strengths. Hit budget stores for dried beans, pasta, and canned goods. Save the fancy grocery trips for fresh produce, nuts, and specialty items. Frozen organic vegetables are often much less expensive at warehouse stores like Costco. The magic happens when you learn to make expensive alternatives at home using whole foods. Making seitan costs as little as 50p for a bag of flour versus several dollars for store-bought versions. Aquafaba (that liquid from chickpea cans) whips into mayo in 10 seconds flat. Dehydrated soya chunks can be much cheaper than frozen proteins and rehydrate into satisfying, meaty textures. The learning curve here is gentler than you'd expect, and the payoff is huge. Take that basic tahini dressing: blend tahini, lemon juice, water, and a pinch of salt, and you've got something that costs pennies but rivals expensive store-bought dressings. Store it in the fridge for up to a week, or make flavor variations by adding garlic for punch, herbs for freshness, or maple syrup for subtle sweetness. This one simple sauce elevates everything from grain bowls to roasted vegetables to raw salads. A pack of dried beans yields roughly double its weight when cooked, so 500g gives you the equivalent of four drained tins at a fraction of the cost. Zero-waste cooking means using every part of your ingredients to reduce food waste and get more from what you already have. Save vegetable scraps in the freezer to make broth at homeâthose onion skins, carrot tops, and herb stems create rich, flavorful stock for free. Use all parts of your produce, including dual-use vegetables like carrots with their leafy tops. This isn't about being a perfectionistâit's about being practical with preservation techniques that actually save money. That bunch of cilantro you bought for tacos? Chop the stems into your freezer scrap bag for broth, blend any wilting leaves into ice cube trays with olive oil for instant flavor bombs, or quickly blanch and freeze whole sprigs in bags for later use. These simple preservation methods mean you're getting multiple uses from single purchases. Repurpose leftovers creatively to minimize waste and stretch your grocery dollars. That leftover rice becomes fried rice, grain salads, or soup base. Wilting greens get a second life in smoothies, soups, or pesto. Freeze unused produce before it spoilsâthose browning bananas are perfect for smoothies and baking. The bottom line? Plant-based eating can cost less than $2 per serving with the right approach. Studies consistently show that people eating plant-based spend less on food than any other group, with savings jumping to $900 annually compared to Mediterranean diets. The core of a vegan dietâwhole grains, beans, vegetables, and fruitsâis among the most affordable foods available. You don't need to go full vegan overnight to see these benefits. Start with Meatless Monday and gradually build your confidence with one new plant-based recipe each week. Focus on mastering a few simple, satisfying base recipes firstâlike a versatile grain bowl template or a basic bean and vegetable soupâthen expand your skills as you discover which flavors and techniques you enjoy most. The beauty of this approach is that you're not just saving money now, you're building sustainable cooking skills that compound over time. Your grocery budgetâand your healthâwill reward you for making the switch to these smart, sustainable eating habits.
