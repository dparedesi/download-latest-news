Umbrella Bob strikes back! In a move that can best be described as “Chapekian,” the Walt Disney World fan-favorite airline is changing everything that made Southwest, Southwest. This article details the huge changes to the budget carrier that will fundamentally alter allegiances with family travelers for decades to come. To be clear, the title is sarcasm. Questioning whether Bob Chapek had suddenly been promoted to CEO of Southwest Airlines is what first crossed my mind when hearing this news. I also may or may not have looked up SWA’s Board of Directors to see if ole Bobby Boy had snuck into a high-level leadership position. Chapek is unaffiliated with Southwest Airlines…for now. Perhaps he’s waiting for a call from Spirit. That does seem more his speed. As it turns out, Southwest Airline’s CEO is Bob Jordan, who also serves as President and Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors. Bob is a 36-year Southwest veteran, who has held 15 different positions in the company. Bob Jordan, as with Bob Chapek before him, proves that decades-long veterans of a company can somehow manage to misunderstand the foundation of fandoms and brand loyalty. At minimum, both demonstrate a lack of concern about alienating the people who make up the respective companies’ core customers and risking what leaders before them built-up over decades. Must be a “Bob Thing.” Here’s a rundown of the changes according to Southwest Airlines, which obviously is trying to spin these in the best light possible: In a nutshell, Southwest is ending its “bags fly free” program and charging all but business travelers and high-status customers for checked bags. Southwest is also reducing the points most customers earn on flights on the one hand, and devaluing its points upon redemption on the other hand. Southwest is also introducing a basic economy fare that could, in theory, be cheaper than its current fares. Equally likely, it will result in nickel & diming a la Frontier and Spirit that hits consumers with hidden fees and upcharges after the lower upfront booking. These changes come ahead of the rollout of assigned seating and premium legroom categories, which were previously announced. Southwest Airline’s changes come after months of pressure from activist investor Elliott Management. The firm took a stake in the airline last year and won five board seats as it pushed for major changes at the company, which clung to perks like free checked bags, no change fees, and open seating. “Two bags fly free” is a registered trademark of Southwest Airlines. Its about-face on what executives long cast as a sacrosanct passenger perk comes as something of a surprise. United’s CEO likened Southwest ending its flyer-friendly baggage policies to the “slaying of a sacred cow.” At the same time, it’s not surprising that investors would want a slice of that “fee pie.” Other airlines generated more than $5 billion from bag fees last year, according to federal data. Southwest executives have long said they would not charge for bags, telling Wall Street it’s a major reason why customers chose the airline. (Like Costco and cheap hot dogs!) Just last fall, Southwest doubled-down on this position at its investor day, stating it had down rigorous research that such a policy would cost the company $300 million. Although Southwest said that it would gain between $1 billion and $1.5 billion from charging for bags, the company indicated it would lose $1.8 billion of market share over time. Southwest said at the time that its ‘bags fly free’ policy generates market share gains in excess of potential lost revenue from baggage fees. In “fairness,” Southwest’s stock was up 8% on the day (an otherwise down one for the broader markets) after announcing these changes. That suggests Wall Street strongly endorses the moves as being good for business. Of course, it’s fair to point out that what’s good for investors in the short term is often at odds with what’s good for companies in the long term. This is especially true for companies that have spent decades building up fan loyalty and brand goodwill. We’ve had an article or two ’round these parts about the dangers of chasing quarterly results at the expense of inflicting reputational damage. (I’m not a fan of this approach, to put it mildly.) Turning to commentary, the title wasn’t a joke. Well, it was to the extent that I didn’t actually believe Bob Chapek had secretly become CEO of Southwest Airlines. But I’m completely sincere that this strikes me as a very Chapekian move, analogous to what happened to Walt Disney World a few years ago. Bob Chapek is not running Southwest, but it’s the same type of short-term gains mentality that’s ruining Southwest. In both cases, those calling the shots seem to fundamentally misunderstand the appeal of their products. In Southwest’s case, the company has revealed a dramatic turnaround plan, that (spoiler alert) mostly copies the business plans of legacy carriers like Delta, United, and American. During presentation to investors late last year, Southwest Airlines executives laid out plans for assigned seating, extra-legroom seats for purchase, a redesigned cabin, and other behind-the-scenes initiatives designed to increase revenue and turn around an underperforming stock price. Fast-forward to today, and Southwest is ditching its unique playbook of more than 50 years that had developed it a loyal fan following in favor of an airline that largely resembles most of its peers. Now, Southwest is dropping its famous “bags fly free” slogan as part of a massive push for the carrier to end long-standing customer perks and policies. Sound familiar? It’s not that much different than Walt Disney World making a variety of business decisions and justifying them on the basis of what’s “standard industry practice.” Both companies have seemingly forgotten what makes them standouts in their respective travel classes, voluntarily ditching their distinct advantages to be more like everyone else. Unicorns who’d rather be among a herd of horses. We’ve often pointed out that despite Walt Disney World being a resort business that also operates theme parks, Disney actually is not that good of a hotelier. We’ve further argued that it made little sense for Disney to chase Marriott, Hilton, and Hyatt–that Disney is better off differentiating itself and competing on its own terms (themed design, perks, etc.)–that Disney cannot compete on the terms of real world hotel brands. This is because even most mid-tier chained-brand hotels handily beat Disney on operations. When it comes to the luxury properties (JW Marriott, Park Hyatt, Conrad, etc), there’s absolutely no competition. All of those brands handily trounce even the best Deluxe Resorts. Hence Disney being better off competing on its own terms and differentiating its product offerings to minimize comparisons, as opposed to inviting them. It’s the same story with Southwest versus the legacy carriers. The competitive advantage that Southwest had was its loyalty among its fans and families as being the convenient and friendly airline that offered perks and less friction. Southwest has built generational goodwill on the basis of its intangibles. Even though it was technically a budget airline, Southwest has, over time, inched up into the pricing territory occupied by Delta, United, and AA. Despite that, it was still preferred by some travelers because it offered a distinct advantage via attitude, perks, and a traveler-friendly ethos. In voluntarily giving that up for some reason, Southwest is going to invite freer comparison–and comparison shopping on price–via consumers. Travelers will try Delta, United, and American as a result. That should be worrying for Southwest because, frankly, it cannot compete with those airlines on the overall experience. Those airlines offer premium cabins, lounges, international destinations & alliances, reward partners, and–most importantly–have invested significantly in their terminal and in-flight experiences in recent years. Southwest has none of that. I have some degree of sympathy towards Bob (Jordan, not Chapek). He and other Southwest executives have fought a hard fight against activist investors, even as the airline has endured struggles. They tried to retain the ‘secret sauce’ that made Southwest, Southwest, but ultimately had to give in. Part of this is happening no doubt because Wall Street is seeing the success that other domestic airlines are having in catering upmarket towards business and luxury travelers. That’s been a growth engine for Delta and United, and those legacy carriers have increased their premium product offerings to improve their businesses. Investors are salivating at that, and want the same for Southwest. Not to stereotype or paint with too broad of a brush, but I would hazard a guess most Wall Street types have never flown Southwest. They don’t seem to grasp what it is–or rather, what it is not. Bluntly, Southwest is not an airline catering to business or luxury travelers. They are upending their business to chase a market that does not exist. In the process, once families and leisure travelers who were loyal to Southwest have tasted the proverbial steak (and not even filet, since the U.S. legacy carriers aren’t that good compared to their international counterparts) of Delta or United, they aren’t going back to the hamburger helper that is SWA. I say this as someone who used to fly Southwest exclusively and still does from time-to-time. Every time I fly SWA, I remember why Delta is my favorite airline. In terms of the Disney trip planning angle, that’s it. Don’t be a creature of habit and continue to fly Southwest if there’s no compelling reason for you to remain loyal. Vote with your wallet and feet, and jump to a different carrier. The ‘best’ airline for you will vary based on your home airport, but consider giving others a shot. For us, flying between Southern California and Orlando–or LAX to international destinations–Delta is far and away the best U.S. carrier. It’s not even a remotely close call. Your mileage may vary, quite literally in this case. The timing of this move by Southwest also strikes me as really odd. To Bob Chapek’s credit (words I hate typing), at least his approach to degrading the Walt Disney World guest experience was well-timed. It was done during a tumultuous time that offered Disney the cloak of the phased reopening as an excuse to reset the guest experience–and consumer expectations. It’s obvious to us that was a convenient excuse, but more importantly, it was opportune timing. Disney under Chapek acted aggressively once it realized revenge travel was going to be a thing, and capitalized on pent-up demand and reduced consumer expectations to raise prices while cutting corners and removing perks. People kept packing the parks, regardless, because they were making up for lost time and traveling again. Once it became clear that pent-up demand was running its course (some other things also happened), Disney seized the opportunity for another reset. It axed Chapek and brought back the Beloved Bob (Iger) to make popular decisions and be the fan savior for a bit, before becoming the villian. That’s the CliffNotes version, but the point is that Walt Disney World’s trajectory has been to improve the guest experience, fix things, and pull various “levers” to win over former fans and consumers–and that’s an arc that began over 2 years ago! Southwest seems to have missed the memo that pent-up demand is over, and is speedrunning Walt Disney World’s misguided decisions from ~4 years ago. At least back then, the decisions–however misguided–could be leveraged for a short-term bump before a “hero” came back to restore the company to its former glory. Instead, Southwest Airlines is doing this at a time when consumer confidence is cratering, markets are down, and a recession is looming. On the exact same day that SWA made this massive move, several other major airlines cut their earnings forecasts due to soft demand and economic uncertainty. Southwest is also making this foundational paradigm shift while in a fundamentally different position from Walt Disney World. Regardless of how disappointed fans have been by dubious decisions of the Chapek regime, Walt Disney World still offered a compelling product and held unparalleled position as the market leader. Although Universal and other parks are competitors, there is no true substitute good for Walt Disney World. It would take a lot of truly terrible decisions to make Disney comparable to Six Flags (not for lack of effort). By contrast, Southwest has put itself in a position where it now does have direct competitors and, as noted above, it’s inviting unfavorable comparison. Southwest is now on par with Delta, United, and American in terms of pricing…but not the overall quality of the experience. Experience-wise, Southwest is arguably positioning itself to be like Frontier and Spirit…but without the attractive pricing that causes travelers to overlook those airlines’ faults. This no man’s land that SWA is seeking to occupy makes the circumstances here completely different from Walt Disney World a few years ago, making this move all the more confounding.

Hearing your feedback–even when you disagree with us–is both interesting to us and helpful to other readers, so please share your thoughts below in the comments! I fly Southwest because I know the price I book at is the price I’ll pay – end of story. I don’t even check anything else because it’s too much of a hassle/extra math. If I now have to start doing the math of bag fees, etc. every time I want to price out flights – then I now have no reason NOT to check sites like kayak & what not to see if I’m actually paying a good rate or not or if there’s a direct flight or better layover via another airline. Basically – they had me as a captive audience for all my flying and now don’t – I think that math they did on bag fees being less than the bookings they’ll loose to other companies is spot on. I read the email from SWA today and thought the exact same thing as your article outlines! What are they THINKING? Or perhaps, just NOT thinking enough about long term customer erosion. Their prices have been creeping up and they are already more expensive than most carriers out of the 2 major airports near us. I had a TERRIBLE experience on my most recent flight as well. After my final miles are burned, which will be easy with their new deflation plan, I will cancel my RR credit card and be done. That’s pretty sad because for many years, they were my go to airline. And we travel with carry on luggage, so it wasn’t about the lack of fees for checked baggage. SWA just felt a little more homey and caring and maybe even fun, if that’s possible for an airline. Hi Brother, I like what you wrote here and tend to agree with you. In general. The flip side of the coin is that the Ash Heap of American business history is full of once iconic and dominating brands that failed to Keep Up With The Joneses. (Sears at one point had TWO-thirds of the American populace shopping there.) Will history record these decisions by Southwest as the Fait Accompli that eventually killed the company? Maybe. But it is waaayyy too early to make a salient argument that these decisions will hurt or destroy Southwest in the long-term. They just might be what keeps it going another 50 years. Over dinner our family was talking about the changes as Southwest. My 23 year old said, “Dad, I’ve never flown on another airline.” All of this feels like loosing a longtime friend over something stupid. I sent an email to Southwest and shared the story of my son and reminded the airline that “loyalty goes two ways”, if you want my loyalty, you need to be loyal to me. With the Southwest difference obliterated, I feel I’m free to roam the county on other airlines. I’ve contact Chase to inquire about cancelling my Southwest credit card and will be exploring other travel cards. I saw a post on BlueSky that announced Southwest’s newest fare: “Wanna Stay Home”. Yep, I’m feeling that right now. As both a lifelong Disney and SWA fan and loyal customer, I’m unhappy about the changes to both companies over the last five years. But the reality of a public company in the golden age of “the cult of shareholder value” is that activist investors, be they Nelson Peltz or Elliott Management, will relentlessly agitate for bottom-line impacting changes. No company management is safe from this pressure (except Berkshire of course). We’re a society that worships at a cross of gold, and what’s happened at Disney and SWA is a direct reflection of that. All we can do in response is vote with our wallets, which means forgoing experiences which historically brought great joy. It’s a conundrum that makes me both angry and sad, tbh. We have very limited options when it comes to flying direct from Pittsburgh to MCO, but you can bet I will be exploring all options now, including driving. I had always tried to book with SW first for their perks, but if they are going to nickel and dime us like everyone else, then the lowest price will win. Very disappointed in Southwest. I’ve been pretty loyal to Southwest over the years- earning companion pass and a boatload of points through their personal and business cards is part of what allows my family to continue to be out of state annual passholders. They’re also only one of two carriers to offer direct flights to Orlando from my home airport (JetBlue being the other), and Southwest almost always has the better flight times. The devaluation of points and losing free cancellations at the lower tiers are really the announcements that are killing me. I already have a companion pass through the end of 2026 (and I fully expect by 2027 it won’t be so easy to earn the CP) and likely we’ll keep flying until our very significant amount of points run out, but after that, chances are JetBlue will become our go-to and I’ll work on hacking my way to a ton of points with them instead.

Title: How Target put a target on its own back

Target was the cool place to shop. Now it's everyone's favorite target. There are few activities more delightful than getting a little wine drunk and hitting up the local Target to go treasure hunting. Sure, you pretend you're there for a legitimate reason — to pick up toilet paper or trash bags. But whatever the plan was going in, you wind up with a basket full of random goodies: a bikini for a vacation you're not taking and party favors for a gathering you're not having. A yoga mat! Hot Cheetos! Five packs of gum! At Target, the world is your oyster in terms of stocking up on stuff you absolutely do not need. Even if you're doing Target sober, you wind up drunk on stuff. But lately, that Target trip has been a little less joyful, if you're even going at all. The Minneapolis-based retailer has been going through a rough patch as price-conscious consumers cut down on just-for-funsies buys that fuel Target's sales. And in terms of politics, it seems like Target can't get anything right. For the past two years, it's found itself at the center of America's culture wars, drawing the ire of conservatives and progressives alike. For some consumers, popping into Target (or refusing to) has turned into a political statement, though it's not clear what statement it even makes. Target can't decide what it stands for, ideologically. For many businesses, that's fine, but in Target's case, cultural relevancy is baked into the business model, and it keeps waffling on how it wants to be relevant. What Target stands for economically isn't working right now, either — it's operating from a place of weakness. The result: a Target that can't keep a, well, target off its back. If you want to get a sense of how things have been going for Target lately, just take a look at its stock price. Target shares are down by more than 30% over the past year and by over 50% since their 2021 peak. While its most recent quarterly earnings were generally in line with Wall Street's expectations, it hasn't reported strong financial results since the pandemic. The retailer also said sales were off in February because of the weather and "declining consumer confidence," and it has anticipated tariff-related price increases in a matter of days. Things are not working in Target's favor, in part, because it relies on discretionary spending — basically, the nonessentials. As people pull back on that kind of spending amid inflation and worries about the economy, that hits Target where it hurts. "People expect prices to rise, and that's causing people to spend more conservatively, and that's causing them to think twice about throwing this or that other thing into their cart," said Zak Stambor, a senior retail and e-commerce analyst at EMARKETER. "Target's business relies on people throwing this or that into their cart." (EMARKETER is owned by Axel Springer, the parent company of Business Insider.) Target is struggling to differentiate itself and compete against Walmart, Amazon, and Costco, said Michael Baker, a managing director and senior research analyst at D.A. Davidson. If a consumer's focus is product selection and wowing customers with compelling offers, Costco's the answer (or at least as good as Target). If it's convenience, it's Amazon. If it's price, Walmart wins. "That doesn't mean that Target can't find their niche," Baker said, but the niche it does have — wants and not needs — is one that doesn't work great in this environment. "With the wind at their back and people spending a lot on discretionary items, we think Target can compete reasonably well, but in a more difficult environment, the increased competition over the past decade or so, I think, makes it that much more difficult for them," he said. Target is also struggling to catch up in some booming areas that are working for its competitors, like groceries and e-commerce. Both efforts have been undertaken "halfheartedly," said Zhihan Ma, a senior research analyst at Bernstein. Target largely relies on its stores to fulfill online orders, which may be cheaper in terms of the up-front cost to implement, but it's very labor intensive, as associates are expected to deal with in-person shoppers and e-commerce customers in tandem. Beyond the slow-walked investments, one of the key differentiators for Target — a relatively enjoyable shopping experience — has been undercut in recent years. Target's attempts to fight retail theft mean more merchandise winds up locked up. Like with other retailers, some locations have problems with inventory shortages or crowded aisles. The result is a shopping experience that isn't a bang-up time, which is especially damaging for Target, where a bit of fun is part of the point. "The business is what the business is to a large extent," Stambor said. "Target is a place to find that cool other thing that you didn't expect to throw into your cart." While Target has been having a tough time financially over the past couple of years, it may be even worse when it comes to the news. Yes, there are some positive headlines about Stanley's "Wicked"-themed cups and everything it's doing with Taylor Swift. But there are a lot more negative headlines Target would rather not see. One of the ways Target has sought to differentiate itself from competitors is by embracing a rather cosmopolitan identity. It does collaborations and deals with designers, big-name brands, and celebrities. It tries to get higher-end consumers in the door. It's a bit fancy — there's a reason people use a little French accent to call it "Tar-jay." That means some of its consumers, particularly those who are more progressive leaning, expect more from it, and in some cases, Target has been happy to oblige. "In some ways, they're victims of their own success," Baker said. "Target has come to stand for fashion and fun and it is really a very culturally relevant retailer," he said, which puts it more in the crosshairs than Walmart and Amazon. As recently as 2020, Target was leaning into this identity. The Minneapolis-based retailer had positioned itself as a leader on racial justice in response to George Floyd's murder by a Minneapolis police officer in 2020. The moves seemed to go over well until 2023, when it stumbled into a series of culture-war woes. That year, many businesses faced a backlash after a Bud Light marketing campaign featuring the transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney sparked outrage among some consumers in the spring. Heading into the summer, Target's Pride month collection — something it's been doing for years — became the subject of right-ring focus. Some of the hullabaloo was completely made up, such as false social media reports that Target was selling "tuck-friendly" bathing suits for children. But the dust-up also moved from social media to the real world: Some angry shoppers were actually attacking associates and destroying store displays. Target scaled back its Pride collection, moving items to the back of the store in some locations and pulling some items altogether. It later said the backlash hurt sales. Since then, Target's been stuck in a loop of corporate identity indecision that it seems unable to get out of. The decision to scale back on Pride made no one happy — some consumers were already upset about the merchandise's existence in the first place, and others were upset because Target backed down. Target declined to comment for this story, but with regard to its diversity strategy and business outlook, a spokesperson pointed to links to its "Belonging at the Bullseye Strategy" and its fourth-quarter results. Target has taken a similar please-no-one approach when it comes to its diversity, equity, and inclusion policies. In January, the company said it was axing multiple DEI initiatives, including ending its three-year DEI goals, wrapping up a program to invest in Black-owned businesses, and stopping participation in external diversity-focused surveys. Target's DEI efforts and reversals have been met by resistance on several fronts. On the right, the retailer has been hit by a lawsuit brought by the state of Florida, among others, saying investors weren't made aware of the risks of Target's DEI initiatives and potential backlash. On the left, the Atlanta pastor Jamal Bryant has called for a 40-day boycott of Target over its DEI rollback. "Any time a company is visible, it's a target for activists who have one agenda or another," said Brayden King, a management professor at Northwestern. At a moment when much of corporate America is anxious about the political environment, Target, in particular, seems to be bearing the brunt of all these swirling emotions. Many people feel powerless when it comes to actual politics, so pouring their frustrations into things they can control — where and how they shop — turns into an outlet for some sort of action. The big issue, however, isn't that Target sold Pride merchandise or undertook DEI initiatives, it's that it so openly waffled on all of it. Again, it's similar to Bud Light: The near-ubiquitous beer brand did a tiny marketing campaign with a transgender influencer, and when that caught fire online among right-wing personalities, the company panicked and backed down instead of keeping calm and staying the course. When a company capitulates to backlash and cowers, it suggests what it initially did was incorrect — and ultimately pleases nobody. Wavering draws more attention to the issue. It signifies weakness — which, in the case of Target's business, is part of the problem. It also degrades trust with consumers and turns the company into a more obvious target for activists down the line. "That kind of seesawing back and forth and saying one thing and doing another, that's what gets brands like Target in trouble," said David Albert, the chief insights officer at Collage Group, a consumer research firm that focuses on multicultural audiences. "We've seen here, especially with Target, is that they've eroded that trust because they're not doing what they say and they don't say what they do." It's not clear how much the political noise will impact Target's bottom line. The 2023 Pride backlash did ding sales, but that was a temporary problem. As a general rule, the vast majority of boycotts don't work. Consumers are set in their ways and often prioritize convenience. If there's a Target down the street or a Walmart 30 minutes away, most people will stick with Target. Also, if you really start to worry about whether each and every business you interact with aligns exactly with your values, you will likely find there is nowhere on Earth you can shop. "Boycotts, of course, are very effective tactics for drawing attention to a cause," King said. "It will have this effect of making Target look bad. But do I think that it will affect what Target does? Probably not." Just because boycotts rarely work doesn't mean they never work. Bud Light, for one, really did see a decline in sales. The evidence is mixed on whether February's single-day "economic blackout" was effective, but there are at least some signs it may have moved the needle. Ma, from Bernstein, said it's too early to tell if the DEI-related backlash will hurt Target's long-term financials, but she acknowledged that it may introduce more "volatility" into its shorter-term results if it continues to find itself embroiled in cultural backlashes. "It doesn't help, for sure," she said. In terms of the business basics, Target has plans to get back some of that Tarjay sheen. It's amping up its private-label offering, creating more in-house brands that resonate with consumers and give them a reason to go to Target, specifically, rather than somewhere else. It's seeking out more flashy collaborations and partnerships, like with Warby Parker. It's scaling Target Plus, its third-party marketplace. It's still hoping consumers will do a spin around the store for those glorious little splurge buys on top of the basics. Still, in the retail landscape, Target isn't in a highly enviable position. Between price-sensitive consumers and tariff whiplash, the macroeconomic landscape is not stacked in its favor. And its soft business outlook means that in terms of the culture war, it's operating from a place of weakness, which raises the chances of making a misstep. Instead of companies worrying they're going to be the next Bud Light, they're likely starting to worry they'll be the next Target.
