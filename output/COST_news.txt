Two pastors sitting in a sunny window booth were contemplating a serious question: eggs or no eggs? Angelo Rodriguez and Wendell Yorkman met for breakfast on Monday at The Pancake Farm in Manheim Township. On the front door, a sign told customers a $1.50 upcharge would be added to any egg dish, due to the high cost of eggs. Yorkman was debating whether to get pancakes instead. “But then I remembered, my friend was paying,” he said. Rodriguez usually adds a third egg to his breakfasts, but this morning was weighing the upcharge. He recently went to pick up a few groceries for his daughter and looked at the price of a dozen eggs. “It was $8.75 and I said, you know what? She’ll be all right,” he said. Dr. Wendell Yorkman, of Mountville, left, and Pastor Angelo Rodriguez, of Lancaster, chat over breakfast at The Pancake Farm in Manheim Township on Monday, March 3, 2025. Local restaurants, bakeries and grocery stores are feeling the heat from rising egg prices aggravated by the ongoing avian flu outbreak that has taken a toll on the nationwide egg supply. As businesses scramble to keep up with soaring costs, consumers are left to decide if they are willing to spend extra for a breakfast staple and ingredient in many favorite recipes. One booth over from Rodriguez and Wendell, Robyn Weidner said she hasn’t been going out to breakfast as much because of price increases. Even at home, she’s eating less eggs. She was eating a lot of them as a source of protein while she’s in training for a half-marathon. Now she’s turning to other high-protein alternatives like oatmeal and chia seed pudding. “I'm not going out and spending $7.99 on a dozen eggs, I can guarantee you that,” Weidner said. “I'm a single mom, so absolutely not, no way.” READ: Trump opens the door to exempting eggs from tariffs levied on Canada and Mexico READ: Egg prices could jump 41% this year, USDA says, as Trump's bird flu plan is unveiled The average price of one dozen eggs nationwide has risen 96% from $2.52 in January 2024 to $4.95 in January this year, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. But that’s just an average. What Lancaster County residents are seeing can be much higher. Avian flu is a factor. In January 2022, before the outbreak started, one dozen grade A, large eggs cost $1.93 on average, nationwide. In its most recent egg markets overview report, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Agricultural Marketing Service said there are still inadequate egg supplies because of the ongoing avian flu outbreak, but there are signs the situation may be starting to improve. The USDA said the pace of the outbreak is slowing and the national egg inventory rose slightly at the end of February. The USDA said bird flu outbreaks in commercial table egg layer flocks in the first two months of this year resulted in the death of 30.1 million birds, 74% of which lived in conventional caged systems and produce the most common eggs that hit grocery store shelves. Following is the average price of a dozen grade A large eggs in the United States from January 2024 to this past January: Source: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Pennsylvania egg production during January totaled 681.8 million, a 4% decrease from the same time last year, according to the USDA. The state’s population of layer chickens was 6% lower in January, compared to the previous year. Since Feb. 6, more than 136,000 birds in Lancaster County have been affected by avian flu, according to the USDA, but none of them egg layers. Pennsylvania lost 1.9 million laying hens in Dauphin County and more than 85,000 in Lebanon County in early February. Shannon Powers, press secretary for the state Department of Agriculture, said the Shapiro Administration is working to keep costs down for consumers through a Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Recovery Fund, which helps farmers increase biosecurity measures and recover losses. She said the state’s investment in testing and a coordinated response to outbreaks also help farmers minimize the cost to their operations and protect against future harm. Powers said Pennsylvania ranks fourth in the nation in egg production and first in organic egg production. Eggs and other poultry products fall among Pennsylvania’s largest exports, worth $155.6 million. Many factors determine the cost of eggs, Powers said. “Canada and Mexico are two of our largest trading partners. Any negative changes to international trade could impact poultry farmers and the price of eggs,” she said. READ: Here's how Pa. is handling the latest outbreak of bird flu in Lancaster County The Pancake Farm owner Javier Camacho said prices are affecting his business. He said customer traffic is down around 25%. Camacho decided to add the $1.50 upcharge to egg meals a few weeks ago to deal with volatile prices, which he said was a hard decision. “Prices are changing every day,” Camacho said. “If we place an order today and a dozen is $8.25, tomorrow will be $8.75 a dozen.” Camacho said the restaurant uses up to 190 dozen eggs per week. He doesn’t want customers to think he’s using the eggs as an excuse to bring in more money; he said he has to think of his employees and business costs. The upcharge doesn’t apply to every meal. The pancake batter contains eggs, but pancakes don’t get the upcharge because, Camacho said, “they are our main thing.” A price increase on pancakes would be “devastating,” he said. Keith Thompson, of Reading, types in the table information so Marshmellow the mechanical helper knows where to take an order of poached eggs and chipped beef at The Pancake Farm in Manheim Township on Monday, March 3, 2025. Not everyone at The Pancake Farm is concerned. Most diners still have plates of eggs in front of them. “If I need eggs, I buy eggs,” said Nancy Sarley, who had just ordered poached eggs. “I'm just happy to wake up in the morning, I'm not looking at dirt, I’m not worried about the price of eggs,” said David Sarley. At Quarryville Family Restaurant, managing partner Andrew Morgan is torn on how to handle the price of eggs. The restaurant goes through 300 dozen of them per week. He hasn’t changed prices in about 10 months, he said, because he doesn’t want to upset his customers. A meal of two eggs, home fries, toast and bottomless coffee is $5.50 at the restaurant. “We have an awesome group of customers who are very loyal, who say, ‘you got to do what you got to do.’ But we also want to provide value for their hard-earned dollar,” Morgan said. An old purchase order put the issue in stark perspective for Morgan. He said the order shows he paid $31.39 for 30 dozen eggs three years ago. Today he is paying $250.59 for the same amount. “That’s a 700% increase,” he said. READ: Would tariffs hurt Lancaster County businesses, consumers? Here's what we know Brad Milliken, of Lititz, had a breakfast of bacon, eggs and hash browns at The Pancake Farm in Manheim Township on Monday, March 3, 2025. While grocery shopping, customers have to decide how important eggs are to them. At the Dutch-Way Farm Market in Ephrata Township, Kami Miller of Rothsville put one dozen eggs in her cart. “One dozen, that’s all I can afford,” she said, laughing. Miller said, since she moved to Rothsville about a year and a half ago, she’s watched the price of a dozen eggs jump from $1.99 to $5.99. She said she never really watched egg prices until now, and she’s been baking a lot less because of it. Larry Kauffman of East Lampeter Township wasn’t bothered much by the price. He said he always keeps eggs in the house. “I hate to see what they’ll be by Easter,” he said. Frances Eberly of Lititz glanced over the egg display before pushing her cart away. She said she had some eggs at home, so she didn’t need to buy more. Plus, she has a source outside the grocery store; a friend with chickens will sell her a dozen eggs for $3. “I guess if I needed them, I would pay that price,” she said. Eberly said eggs are in so many baked goods that she has cut back on baking because of the price. Scott Petersen, dairy manager at Dutch-Way Farm Market in Ephrata Township, stocks the egg display at the grocery store on Monday, March 3, 2025. Jordan Snader, a partner at Dutch-Way, said the market’s relationship with a local farm lets them keep a steady supply of eggs at a better price than some competitors. One dozen large white eggs were on sale for $5.99 as of Monday. Snader said customers are changing their patterns as egg prices rise, but he said they generally understand that it’s a nationwide problem. Some customers have turned to specialty eggs over commercial white eggs. Dave Dietz, produce and dairy manager at Lemon Street Market in Lancaster city, said it’s been a little challenging to keep eggs in stock. He said egg sales are up 40%-50% over last year. That’s likely because the market has high standards for eggs, Dietz said, usually offering pastured and organic varieties. Prices for specialty eggs haven’t jumped as dramatically as commercial white eggs. For example, Eagle Road brand brown, large eggs from non-GMO fed, pastured hens are priced at $5.49 per dozen, the cheapest eggs at Lemon Street Market. Prices range up to $9.99 per dozen for Alderfer brand brown, jumbo, organic eggs. READ: Middle Creek visitors must change their plans this snow geese season It’s one thing to skip eggs for breakfast. But eggs are a critical ingredient in many baked goods. Laura Wu, co-owner of Hello Mango Asian Bakery in Manheim Township, said she can no longer afford eggs from the wholesale company she was working with. Now she’s hunting for eggs at Costco, Restaurant Depot, and farm markets. It’s not just the price. “It is also difficult to find more eggs,” Wu said. “Everywhere has limits.” The bakery has had to raise prices by $2 for a 6-inch cake and $4 for an 8-inch cake. Wu said she is hoping prices drop in the spring. Erica Wolgemuth-Johnson is experimenting with using less eggs in some of her products at Erica Joy Bakes Gluten Free Creations in Lititz. She has experience baking without eggs; her shop specializes in vegan treats. “I was joking the other day that we’ll just go fully vegan,” Wolgemuth-Johnson said. But she said there are egg-heavy recipes that she will keep, because she created the recipes, like her honey-almond-lavender cake. She hasn’t raised prices so far, since gluten-free products are already a little more expensive and she doesn’t want to price people out. Wolgemuth-Johnson is avoiding making egg-heavy bakes for the shop’s display case. “I’m not going to make it just in the hopes someone comes in and buys it,” she said. Success!

The Trump administration believes a renewed emphasis on biosecurity can help in the battle against bird flu and ease egg prices. The Agriculture Department predicts the current record prices are going to get much worse this year. It’s also not clear how much more farmers can do to keep the virus out. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins offered the first new details about her bird flu plan Wednesday.

Prices of silver in INR terms, have moved up by 15% in CY24 and YTD 2025 the prices are up by another 11%. A confluence of factors such as falling US interest rates, geopolitical situation and uncertainties surrounding Trump policies have been supportive of precious metals. Going ahead silver prices are expected to be well supported. Fundamental Factors The medium term as well as long term factors indicate a positive outlook for silver. The US interest rates are expected to follow a downward trajectory for 2025, albeit at a gradual pace. Over the near to medium term interest rates are a critical determinant of demand for precious metals. The geopolitical situation is expected to remain fluid over the near term and the trade policies of Trump administration are expected to encourage safe haven demand. The long term outlook of a commodity is determined by the demand-supply scenario. The supply of silver has been in deficit over the last four years. The supply for CY24 is estimated at 1,004 million ounces whereas demand is estimated at 1,219 million ounces. The majority of this demand (~60%) comes from industrial uses. Silver finds extensive applications in electronic devices, circuit boards, solar panels and electric vehicle batteries. As the adoption of EVs and green energy technologies continues to gain traction, the industrial demand for silver is expected to remain robust.

The effect of President Trump’s policies appear to be disinflationary in the immediate term with crude oil slumping to ~USD 70/bbl while the impact of higher US tariffs is yet to be seen and would depend on various scenarios (refer our note). As such, the euphoria around President Trump’s victory seems to be fading with the dollar index giving away a large part of its gains since Sep’24 while the INR has also started to rise.

(Neutral) Market Closing Commentary Nifty broke its 10-session losing streak, ending Wednesday’s trading up by 1.15% at 22,337.30. The benchmark indices saw a strong recovery from the oversold zone. The pullback was driven by several factors, including strength in Asian markets, bargain buying in oversold stocks, and value buying in blue-chip stocks. All 13 major sectoral indices closed in the green, with Metals, Information Technology, and Automobile stocks leading the rally. The BSE Midcap and BSE Smallcap indices surged by 2.66% and 2.8%, respectively. Nifty Outlook Index formed a strong bull candle with a higher high and higher low, indicating buying demand emerging for the second session from the 22,000 levels. We anticipate the current pullback to extend toward the 22,500 level, which corresponds to the gap down area from February 28, 2025. Overall, the index is expected to consolidate within the range of 21,700 to 22,500 in the upcoming sessions. Key support levels are identified between 22,000- 21,700, as this range. For a reversal of the short-term corrective trend, the index needs to consistently form higher highs and higher lows. Bank nifty Outlook Bank Nifty formed a second consecutive bull candle with a higher high and higher low highlighting buying demand emerging from the lower band of the last 8 weeks range placed around 48,000-47,800. We expect the index to trade in the range of 47,800-49,000 in the coming sessions. A breach below the lower band of the range will lead to extended decline towards 47,000 levels in the coming sessions. While holding above the support area of will lead to pullback towards the 49,000 levels. Bank Nifty has been consolidating in the broad range of 47,800-50,500 in the last 8 weeks.
