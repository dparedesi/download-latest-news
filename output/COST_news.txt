ByMegan Poinski ByMegan Poinski, Forbes Staff. In this uncertain time for business, a recent PwC survey found that more executives now have confidence in the effectiveness of their boards. That’s good news—until you look at the percentage. Only 35% rate their boards’ overall effectiveness as excellent or good, up from 30% in last year’s study. And that’s actually still more of an improvement: 29% gave that rating in 2021 and 2022. In its survey, PwC spoke with 500 executives in different positions, ranging from CEO to chief legal officer and COO. CEOs had the best view of their boards, with 94% saying they were excellent or good. CFOs also viewed them favorably, with 72% ranking them in good esteem. PwC said this may reflect boards getting better in some ways—with members chosen to provide oversight and financial guidance. And the executives that interact the most with boards do tend to rank them the highest. Board members still may be missing some critical expertise, however. Nearly four in five CIOs ranked their boards as fair or poor, which may reflect a lack of knowledge about technology, cybersecurity and AI among members. About 43% of executives said they wanted AI expertise added to their boards this year, but only 10% of board members expected that to happen. Executives and board members both felt that AI is a top priority for boards in the next 12 months. Regardless, the majority of executives believe their boards can come through when needed. Seven in 10 said they believe their board can guide the company through a crisis, while 88% feel their boards can effectively engage with shareholders. And when changes are needed, six in 10 execs are confident that boards can assess their own performance and make needed shifts. Whether that faith in the boards is merited remains to be seen. As the year progresses into the unknown, the strengths of these boards—and executives’ confidence in them—are likely to be put to the test. Even though the shutdowns of the Covid-19 pandemic era are in the rearview mirror, corporate events and trade shows are becoming increasingly important to businesses. I spoke with Janet Dell, CEO of events company Freeman, about how events are changing to reflect today’s workforce—both in attendees and goals. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. President Donald Trump displays a signed executive order imposing tariffs on imported goods at the “Liberation Day” press conference. The majority of President Donald Trump’s new tariffs were struck down in two federal court cases last week, although it’s certainly not the end of the issue. A three-judge panel at the Court of International Trade ruled that the so-called reciprocal tariffs announced as part of Trump’s “Liberation Day” press conference should be “set aside.” The panel ruled that Trump did not have the authority to impose unlimited tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which gives presidents the power to impose sanctions during national emergencies. In a second lawsuit brought by a group of companies, Washington, D.C. District Judge Rudolph Contreras also found the tariffs to be illegal. But for now, the tariffs—or threat thereof—are still on. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit paused the order halting the tariffs while those judges rule on an appeal. In the meantime, there is still action with new tariffs and existing negotiations. Trump announced a 50% tariff on imported steel and aluminum last week, which goes into effect this week, at an event at U.S. Steel. And negotiations continued last week with China, although progress remains unclear. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last Thursday that talks have stalled. Friday morning, Trump wrote on Truth Social that China “HAS TOTALLY VIOLATED ITS AGREEMENT WITH US.” Monday morning, Chinese authorities shot back, accusing the U.S. of breaching the agreement that both countries came to last month, saying the U.S. introduced “discriminatory restrictive measures against China” after the talks, including expanded export controls on AI chips and other chip-building technologies. Regardless of the broader tariff fight, companies are now starting to reflect the impacts—or projected impacts—in their earnings reports. Forbes senior contributor Shelley E. Kohan analyzed how the nation’s five largest retailers—Walmart, Amazon, Costco, Kroger and Home Depot—are handling tariffs. Companies with significant non-grocery sales have pulled forward inventory purchases before tariffs took effect, trying to stay ahead of the impacts on price. Home Depot executives said they can maintain competitive prices and don’t expect broad increases, while Walmart executives indicated that they will not be able to completely mitigate tariff-related increases. Costco, Kroger and Walmart are all trying to keep their food prices down, especially since consumers have been paying more over the last several years—though popular products, including bananas, coffee, avocados and flowers, are almost always imported. Meanwhile, many of the companies are changing their supply strategies, not relying on any one country for goods or manufacturing. Many businesses continued to lower their outlooks for the rest of the year, given tariff uncertainty. Last week, Best Buy, Macy’s and Abercrombie & Fitch all reduced their sales and earnings projections for the year. President Donald Trump walks with Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell in 2017. Last week was another bumpy ride for the stock market, with ups and downs related to tariffs, government financial reports and Big Tech. April’s inflation figures remained relatively mild, not yet showing the impact of President Donald Trump’s tariff policies. Personal consumption expenditures increased 2.1% above April 2024, the lowest PCE inflation rate since last September, and getting close to the Federal Reserve’s sweet spot of 2% inflation. However, economists at Bank of America and Goldman Sachs both forecast a jump in tariff-related inflation to 3.6% by December—though they say it is not expected to be as sharp of a jolt in price as the post-pandemic inflation of 2021 and 2022. The lower inflation rate, however, doesn’t mean that interest rate cuts are set to happen anytime soon. Minutes from the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee’s early May meeting were released last week, and they indicated that the Fed is planning to continue to watch the impacts of Trump’s planned policies—which to date have been sudden, jarring and unpredictable—before making any moves, writes Forbes senior contributor Charles Lloyd Bovaird II. Forbes senior contributor Erik Sherman writes it’s unlikely there will be any changes to interest rates before the end of the year. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell met with Trump last week, and Powell reaffirmed that the Fed would continue to make policy decisions “based solely on careful, objective, and non-political analysis.” Regardless of the indicators last week, small businesses are feeling decidedly less optimistic, writes Forbes’ Brandon Kochkodin. The April Small Business Optimism Index, published monthly by the National Federation of Independent Business, showed optimism down to 95.8, below the 51-year average of 98, and down 1.6% from March. Retail business owners had the lowest scores, with optimism of 93.7. More than three-quarters said supply chain issues were impacting their business, and 14% said their inventories were too low. But negative feelings are running high across all sectors; the most confident sector in April was construction, and that was down nearly 4 points from January. getty As federal government attitudes on diversity, equity and inclusion push the issue to the back of corporate priorities, companies are talking about it a whole lot less. According to an analysis by Gravity Research, references to DEI and associated terminology in Fortune 100 company reports dropped 72% between 2024 and 2025. The acronym DEI saw the largest drop in mentions—down 98%—while more neutral terms about diversifying, such as “inclusion” and “belonging” were down by more than a third. The only place where mentions of DEI increased was on earnings calls, where the term came up 390% more often—but usually because of more shareholder questions about it. Gravity Research Vice President of Thought Leadership Joanna Piacenza said the report “speaks volumes to the current political environment,” which has made diversity initiatives a polarizing issue—as well as a legal one. Freeman CEO Janet Dell. Events have retained their popularity through the pandemic, but are changing based on attendees and preferences. I talked to Janet Dell, CEO of global event company Freeman, about why events are still so successful and vital for business. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. During the pandemic and soon afterwards, many Baby Boomers retired, and the workforce now has many more Millennials and Gen Zers. How have events changed to reflect the age of the attendees? Dell: Each of the demographics has a different preference in general. The younger demographics—Gens Z and Alpha and Millennials—want that face-to-face engagement. They’re looking for ways to get more professional development opportunities, connect with buyers, learn about what’s cutting edge in their industry in particular, because there’s a lot more hybrid working arrangements. Events are turning into “bleisure” events, where you’re going out for the event and staying a few days after. People are looking at ways to make it easier because talking about the digital native versus a digital hybrid. We’re helping support the events, partnering with someone with AI tools that can help you match-make. Or it can help you understand dwell times and engagement when you go through a booth. So our exhibitors know: Is this impactful content? Am I optimally set up? [We also make] sure there’s more time in the events for people to talk to one another. I would say one of the bigger changes pre- and post- pandemic is not overscheduling, and trying to give people more time to engage and immerse, and not just going back-to-back-to-back on things, straight into a happy hour, then a dinner, et cetera. There’s more of a consumer slant versus B2B, where they’re really thinking about the customized individual experience versus a blanket use-the-same-formulas-as-they-did-before. We’ve got a lot of new, fresh ideas, married with a lot of long-tenured people that have been in events, experience and exhibits for a long time. Looking at some of the recent research Freeman has done, people place a huge amount of trust in what they see, learn and experience at events. Has it always been that way? It’s always been the most powerful medium for building trust is face-to-face. You can’t beat bringing someone together, having a conversation, reading the verbal and the nonverbal cues, and then interacting live. That’s what people missed in the pandemic, and why there was this incredible pent up demand. We saw virtual events be adopted. They have a place, and it’s much more inclusive. But then when people came back,[there was] just incredible demand, and it held up. Ninety-four percent say this is the biggest trust-building medium. It allows you to grow your interpersonal skills. You can gain professional confidence, and you stay on cutting edge in the industry. It also helps close business, in terms of commerce and retain clients because you’re showing them all the benefits of what you’re doing. Once you leave that event, 87% of the people that have attended are more likely to go to your website. You’ve got that 365-day connection, which is what you want to see with your clients to make sure that they stay loyal to your brand. What do executives need to know about events? They need to be clear on what their objective is. We do thousands of events a year and we bring in 400,000 to 500,000 exhibitors. They have to be clear on what their objective is for the event. Why would you be attending? You can get matched up with the right event to be able to take advantage of that. If you can do that, then you can start planning out how you're going to take advantage of it, whether it’s through sessions, keynote speakers, the trade show floor, experiences or one-to-one special events like hosted-buyer-type scenarios. All those things can have a more personalized experience and therefore a better return on it.

Title: “Something wicked this way comes,” Ray Bradbury (1962)

It was a great and horrifying story about two young boys and the arrival of the Cooger and Dark Carnival in Green Town, Illinois. If you entered the carnival grounds late at night, you might be drawn to its iconic ride, Cooger & Dark’s Pandemonium Shadow Show. It’s a story about the ways in which evil can be a powerful temptation to even the best of people. Some of the lines are maddeningly good. A stranger is shot in the street, you hardly move to help. But if, half an hour before, you spent just ten minutes with the fellow and knew a little about him and his family, you might just jump in front of his killer and try to stop it. Really knowing is good. Not knowing, or refusing to know is bad, or amoral, at least. You can’t act if you don’t know. Others half-haunt me. Oh, what strange wonderful clocks women are. They nest in Time. They make the flesh that holds fast and binds eternity. They live inside the gift, know power, accept, and need not mention it. Why speak of time when you are Time, and shape the universal moments, as they pass, into warmth and action? How men envy and often hate these warm clocks, these wives, who know they will live forever. Bradbury declared it his most “delicious” story. The title is also an homage to the witches of Macbeth (Act 4, Scene 1, following “boil and trouble”): 2nd Witch: By the pricking of my thumbs, Something wicked this way comes. [Knocking] Open locks, Whoever knocks! [Enter Macbeth] I admit to having been thinking of dark circuses and evil clowns rather a lot lately. They make it hard to pick up the newspaper most mornings. Chief Justice Warren got it, too: “I always turn to the sports section first. The sports section records man’s accomplishments; the front page has nothing but man’s failures” (Sports Illustrated, July 22, 1968). For readers of the Mutual Fund Observer, two coming circuses will be particularly pressing. Single-stock exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and leveraged single-stock ETFs are relatively new and complex investment products that have garnered significant attention from both investors and researchers. I was struck by the utter flood of new fund registrations in the first weeks of May, which might signal a July or August. Launch. In the middle of 2024, there were about 100 such funds globally. The first in the US seems to have been AXS Tesla and AXS NVIDIA, both launched in 2022. Trading volume and AUM data are scant. Morningstar did report a doubling in the pool’s AUM in the first quarter of 2024. What do they do? In general, they do not own the single stock in question. They own derivatives tied to the performance of the stock, but they are generally tied to one day’s performance: if Tesla drops 25% tomorrow, an inverse-leveraged TSLA ETF will drop by 25%, or 50%, or 75% in a day. The extent of the drop depends on the extent of the leverage provided. The same is true in the other direction. Two ugly realities: In general, these are toys for speculators. They are not investment products. Sadly, investors fall for marketing and overestimate their own abilities. They think they’ll track that 3X DraftKings ETF and move like a ballerina. Or, frankly, more likely, like Dumbo. In general, academic and professional research reach the same conclusion. If you’re a professional with vast tracking resources and a holding period of one day or less, these are fine tools. If you aren’t a professional and don’t intend to monitor hour-by-hour for the rest of your adult life, run away. Morningstar’s take: Single-stock ETFs can meet the needs of a few. High-conviction traders with a single-day or shorter holding period may find them useful vehicles to express their views. After all, it’s hard for everyday investors to use leverage or construct their own covered calls. But the fact is that these products are rarely sensible for everyday investors. They are flawed, costly, and liable to take more from investors than they give. (Ryan Jackson, “For Most Investors, Single-Stock ETFs Are Best Left Alone,” Morningstar.com, 4/9/2024) Which, of course, means that we’re being flooded with them. Here’s a sampling of the 485A prospectus filings that MFO came across during just two weeks in May 2025: More specialized new games include: On May 28, 2025, Mr. Trump’s Department of Labor rescinded a 2022 policy urging “extreme caution” about including cryptocurrency in retirement plans. The official announcement read: The U.S. Department of Labor’s Employee Benefits Security Administration has rescinded a 2022 compliance release that previously discouraged fiduciaries from including cryptocurrency options in 401(k) retirement plans. The 2022 guidance directed plan fiduciaries to exercise “extreme care” before adding cryptocurrency to investment menus. This language deviated from the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and marked a departure from the department’s historically neutral, principled-based approach to fiduciary investment decisions. “The Biden administration’s department of labor made a choice to put their thumb on the scale,” said U.S. Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer. “We’re rolling back this overreach and making it clear that investment decisions should be made by fiduciaries, not D.C. bureaucrats.” One might pause at the breathtaking hypocrisy disguised as policy guidance. If we’re talking about crypto, beloved by Elon & co., the rule is “investment decisions should be made by fiduciaries, not D.C. bureaucrats.” If we’re talking about the option of socially-responsible investments in the same accounts, the rule reverses, and the government must surely make financial decisions rather than trusting fiduciaries. It’s a policy that marries the mendacious with the disastrous, a rare accomplishment. The proposed inclusion of cryptocurrencies in employer retirement plan options raises significant concerns about investor protection, particularly given the extreme volatility and risk characteristics these digital assets exhibit. The cryptocurrency market has experienced substantial growth in trading activity, with the top exchanges processing trillions in volume annually. According to current market data, there are literally millions of cryptocurrencies in circulation (really, you could make your own this afternoon since there are no regulations and no barriers to entry). The total cryptocurrency market capitalization fell 18.6% in Q1 2025 to close at $2.8 trillion, after briefly touching $3.8 trillion in January. This dramatic swing within a single quarter exemplifies the type of volatility that could devastate retirement portfolios, particularly for investors nearing or in retirement who have limited time to recover from significant losses. Consider, for example, the drawdown periods for the oldest and most liquid coin, Bitcoin. Source: LazyPortfolioETF, using Highcharts graphing. Remember, this is just the downside. There are lunatic price spikes the rest of the time. The point here is to help you get a big picture of how deep the knife plunges (the red drawdowns) and how long the wound lasts (the gray “ramps” shows months to recovery). Below are the five-year risk-return metrics for the two largest cryptocurrencies, which we assume are the two most likely to infiltrate a retirement plan. Sources: Lazy Portfolio ETF (for Bitcoin), Portfolio Labs ETH-USD, and S&P Ethereum Index The data reveals several alarming characteristics that underscore the inappropriateness of these investments for retirement accounts. Bitcoin, despite being the most established cryptocurrency, has experienced maximum drawdowns exceeding 70%, meaning investors could lose more than 70% of their investment. The recovery period for Bitcoin’s maximum drawdown required 19 months, during which retirement investors would face sustained and severe portfolio losses. Ethereum presents even more extreme risk characteristics, with a maximum five-year drawdown of nearly 79% (and a near-complete meltdown in 2018) The current Ethereum drawdown stands at 45.29%, that is, at the end of May 2025, an Ether is worth 45% less than it was at its November 2021 peak. For retirement investors, such sustained periods of substantial losses could prove financially catastrophic, particularly for those requiring portfolio withdrawals during retirement. The smaller cryptocurrencies are worse. Retirement investors require stable, predictable growth that preserves capital while generating reasonable returns over long time horizons. The documented maximum drawdowns approaching 95-96% for major cryptocurrencies represent existential threats to the retirement security of elderly investors. The extreme volatility documented in this analysis represents not an investment opportunity but rather a fundamental threat to retirement system stability and individual financial security. These decisions, government and corporate, continue to move the markets in the direction of a casino. Investors’ conviction that “patience is for losers” just makes them losers. Buy quality stocks from experienced managers. Diversify away from assets that depend on Washington acting like adults. Find managers who manage volatility thoughtfully. We list them! What’s an investor to do? Learn from the experience of others. When you suspect something wicked is around, do not go alone into the basement with a flickering light. When you suspect something wicked this way comes, do not wander off on your own – away from the security of friends – “to see what made that noise.” “Acting without knowing takes you right off the cliff.” ― Ray Bradbury, Something Wicked This Way Comes (1962) David Snowball, PhD (Massachusetts).

Title: Walmart, Amazon, Costco, And Home Depot Tackle The Tariff Whiplash

ByShelley E. Kohan ByShelley E. Kohan, Senior Contributor. Coscto is focused on member pricing and plans to try and mitigate as much of the impact from tariffs ... More as it can for its customers. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) The five largest retailers in the U.S -- Walmart, Amazon, Costco, Kroger, and Home Depot-- have all reported their financial earnings for the first part of 2025. The combined force of these retailers equates to nearly 20% of total retail sales in the United States. The big five retailers all agree that it is difficult to predict the future impact of tariffs, however, each retailer has been working on mitigating the impact of tariffs on pricing and product availability for its consumers. The impact of tariffs on financial reporting so far this year has been minimal because most of the earnings reported are from periods before the April 5th tariffs took effect. Home Depot and Walmart shared financials through the end of April, while Costco data goes through mid-May. Kroger, which operates over 20 store banners including Ralphs and Harris Teeter, reported financials through January. Amazon’s first quarter financials run through March. Walmart, Amazon,Costco and Home Depot have pulled forward their inventory purchases to mitigate the impact of tariffs. Purchasing inventory in advance will help ensure a company has product in stock down the line and can offer the best possible pricing. Amazon encouraged its third-party suppliers to do the same. Costco moved up the delivery for patio products and sporting goods to stay ahead of the tariff pricing impacts. While Walmart says it cannot absorb all the cost pressures from tariffs and may have to raise ... More prices, it wants to keep food prices as low as they can. (Photo by: Jeffrey Greenberg/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) Even the U.S.’s largest retailers cannot take the sole burden of the tariffs by absorbing the costs without raising prices. Discount stores, grocery stores, ecommerce players, and warehouse clubs typically run on very thin profit margins. "We’re positioned to manage the cost pressure from tariffs as well or better than anyone. But even at the reduced levels, the higher tariffs will result in higher prices," said Doug McMillon, CEO of Walmart. The magnitude of the tariffs cannot be offset by lower-margin businesses. Home improvement giant Home Depot plans to maintain its competitive pricing despite tariff impacts through stronger supplier partnerships, supply chain diversification, and focusing on improving its productivity across activities. “We don’t see broad-based price increases for our customers at all going forward. It’s a great opportunity for us to take share, and it’s a great opportunity for our suppliers to take share as well,” said Billy Bastek, executive vice president of merchandising at Home Depot. In the grocery sector, where food prices are 2.0% higher on a rolling 12-month basis, consumers are already having to spend more based on inflation. Companies like Walmart are trying to protect against additional costs due to tariffs on food products, considered a non-discretionary expense. “We won’t let tariff-related cost pressure on some general merchandise items put pressure on food prices, " said McMillon. Food tariffs on countries in South and Central America are pressuring imported items like bananas, avocados, coffee, and flowers. “We’ll do our best to control what we can control in order to keep food prices as low as possible," said McMillon. Costco held pricing on pineapples and bananas despite the cost of these goods rising due to tariffs. However, when it came to flowers, which were also impacted by additional tariffs, the company felt that a price increase was absorbable by the consumer as flower purchases were viewed as a discretionary expense. Kroger, with 100% of its sales in the U.S., is looking at being proactive and diversifying its supplier base to keep prices lower, especially in the fresh produce category. "We expect inflation to be 1.5% to 2.5%, which does not include the effects from tariffs," said Todd Foley earlier in the year, interim CFO at Kroger. Amazon customers are becoming more reliant on the company for everyday essential products which ... More represented one out of every three units sold in the U.S. online at Amazon in the first quarter. Global retailers have been looking at diversifying sourcing options to reduce the cost of goods as tariffs are implemented. Amazon and Walmart have been diversifying their supply chains for many years, with a focus on not being too reliant on one country for imports. Two-thirds of what Walmart sells in the U.S. is made, assembled, or grown domestically. Walmart is further diversifying its revenue by leaning into better profit areas such as selling advertising through its retail media network, expanding its marketplace, and increasing membership income. Costco is rerouting goods to non-U.S. markets and working closely with suppliers to find alternate production locations. The private label brand, Kirkland Signature, which represents one-third of Costco’s sales, continues to be a consumer favorite in quality and value. The company has been sourcing the products into countries where items are sold to keep the pricing down. Costco’s most profitable sector, its membership revenue, is up 5.4%, with membership increasing to 137 million members last year despite a rise in its membership price. Home Depot has diversified its supply chain, with over 50% of purchases already sourced in the U.S. “We anticipate that twelve months from now, no single country outside of the United States will represent more than 10% of our purchases," said Ted Decker, CEO of Home Depot. Amazon is relentlessly focused on back-of-house infrastructure to improve delivery speeds and reduce costs by heavily investing in robotics and automation. The purchasing of everyday essentials continues to grow as a category for the consumer, making them more reliant on the Amazon brand and includes categories such as household goods, personal care items, and pantry staples. "We have an extremely large selection, hundreds of millions of unique SKUs (stock keeping units), which means we’re often able to weather challenging conditions better than others. When you have the broadest selection like we do and 2,000,000 plus global sellers like we do, you're better positioned to help customers find whatever items matter to them at lower price points than elsewhere," said Andy Jassy, CEO, Amazon. However, Costco’s narrow merchandise depth and broad assortment allow the company to focus on fewer SKUs, giving it a competitive advantage. "We believe our expertise in buying a limited SKU count model gives us greater agility to navigate the environment and ultimately increase our member values compared to the market," said Gary Millerchip, CFO at Costco. Home Depot will be looking at SKU optimization and possibly editing out some products that are significantly impacted by tariff costs but do not make sense to keep in its current assortment. Other retailers outside the big five have been working on optimizing the product styles that are most relevant to their customer base and eliminating the ones that are too costly or have lower turnover. As we move into the second quarter for most retailers (May through July), pricing may not be as impacted because retail buyers usually procure goods many months in advance of the selling season. However, going into fall and holiday selling, consumers may see price increases just in time for holiday purchasing. With imported items, the tariff is paid at the time it comes through customs, which means those products are most likely not in the U.S. yet. Retailers are unable to predict pricing for later in the year due to the uncertainty of where tariffs will land. There are too many assumptions and factors for retailers to chart a specific path forward during these highly unpredictable times in the retail landscape. The big five retailers continue to model various scenarios to help mitigate price increases or out-of-stocks for their customer base. The advantage with the larger multi-billion dollar retailers like Walmart, Amazon, Costco, Kroger, and Home Depot is the ability to leverage supplier networks and lean into the amount of resources available to help build out more sophisticated infrastructure to support a diversified supply network. The retailers are working hard to make sure prices stay in line with customer expectations, but it is too early within a volatile tariff landscape to predict the actual impact on pricing for consumers for the remainder of the year.

Title: Costco Stock Has a Big Price Tag. Some Investors Are Eyeing a Rare Split

Shoppers are fans of Costco’s prices. Could the warehouse giant’s stock get a smaller price tag, too? That’s on some investors’ minds lately, with shares of Costco Wholesale (COST) among the most-expensive—on a straightforward price-per-share basis—in the S&P 500: The stock, which closed Friday at around $1,040, was one of a dozen with a four-digit share price. (Topping the list, for those who track such things, was NVR (NVR), shares of which ended the week above $7,000 apiece.) Costco’s shares have gotten there in part due to a rise of roughly 25% over the past 12 months, and now there’s renewed chatter about whether the company might choose to split the stock. (Stock splits do nothing to the value of a company—broadly, a 10-for-1 split means that instead of one $100 share, you have 10 $10 shares—but they’re sometimes taken as a bullish signal.) “We remain upbeat on the company's ability to gain share going forward and believe shares are positioned for continued outperformance in the current backdrop. Catalysts from here, in our view, include a potential stock split,” Oppenheimer analysts—who have a bullish rating on the shares, along with a $1,130 price target that is above the Wall Street average as tracked by Visible Alpha—wrote late Thursday after Costco reported quarterly financial results. Talk of a Costco split bubbles up from time to time partly because the company rarely does them; it hasn’t happened since a two-for-one split in early 2000. Management was asked about splits at the company’s January shareholder meeting, with CEO Ron Vachris saying there was “nothing to report.” The company didn’t respond to Investopedia’s request for comment in time for publication. CFO Gary Millerchip on a December conference call said that making the shares comparatively cheap is less useful to investors now than in years past because of the availability of fractional shares. “But we do also recognize that there's a benefit of the stock feeling more affordable for our retail investors and employees who are very important constituents for us," he said. "So we'll continue to evaluate over time.”
