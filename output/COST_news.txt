Good morning! Add sequel fatigue among moviegoers to the growing list of things we can blame the Marvel Cinematic Universe for. At least, that's according to "28 Years Later" writer Alex Garland. In today's big story, the Trump family's plans for a new mobile phone company is the latest example of businesses tied to the president's last name. What's on deck Markets: How the Israel-Iran conflict could spell bad news for stocks. Tech: Inside the billion-dollar war over 'peace tech.' Business: Target's sales are struggling. BI reporters visited three stores to see what the biggest issues were. But first, can you hear me now? If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. The Trump family just made a call on its next big business, and it's hoping you'll do the same. Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump announced plans for a Trump-branded mobile phone service and smartphone, writes BI's Brent D. Griffiths. Dubbed Trump Mobile, it's a familiar business model in the world of Trump Inc. — a licensing agreement allowing for the use of the Trump name with plenty of nods to the president. The unlimited talk, text, and data plan is called the "47 plan" and will cost $47.45 a month, an homage to Donald Trump's run as the 47th and 45th US president. Meanwhile, the business' smartphone, the T1 Phone, will run you $499 when it's available in September and is gold colored (of course). Trump Mobile's website also touts the fact that the phone is made in America, an interesting distinction considering the questions swirling about the potential cost of a made-in-USA iPhone due to tariff concerns. Trump-branded services and products have existed for decades, but merchandise bearing the president's last name certainly hasn't slowed down in recent years. From sneakers to Bibles to cologne, Trump hasn't been shy about lending out the family name for the right price. There is one new twist to Trump's long-standing love of merchandising. Crypto has been a goldmine for the president and his family, including the sale of NFTs and memecoins. Now, Trump's media company is looking to dive deeper into the crypto world with the launch of a bitcoin and ether ETF, writes BI's Jennifer Sor. Trump Media filed documents with the SEC for approval of the ETF, which will aim to be 75% bitcoin and 25% ether. The news comes just a few weeks after the company announced plans to raise $2.5 billion to buy crypto, joining a growing number of companies holding digital assets on their balance sheets. Launching an ETF is a bit more complicated and costly than just buying up bitcoin. One Morningstar analyst previously told BI an ETF costs around $200,000 a year to run. Trump Media's ETF also comes at a time when there has been an influx of famed investors and analysts, from Dan Ives to Nouriel "Dr. Doom" Roubini, pushing into the space. Trump still has more name recognition than just about anyone. But that doesn't guarantee success. After all, how people feel about the Trump name varies greatly. One early data point on the potential ETF isn't looking good. Following the announcement, Trump Media's stock finished the day down about 4%. 1. How the stock market could take flak from the Israel-Iran face-off. Flaring tensions in the Middle East could drag the S&P 500 down by 20%, RBC said. The bank named three ways that could happen: risk to valuations, impact on sentiment, and inflation driven by rising oil prices. 2. Billionaire trader Paul Tudor Jones sounds the alarm on AI. Although AI has great potential, Jones recently warned that the technology could spark mass unemployment and even eradicate the human race. He also said that AI should be regulated. 3. Is the Fed moving too slow? Markets predict more than a 99% chance the Fed will keep rates steady this week, but some economists worry that waiting to cut rates might be a mistake. They pointed to weakness in the labor market and tariff uncertainty as concerns. 1. Can AI predict — and prevent — war? The founders of the peace-tech startup Anadyr Horizon think it can, by creating AI versions of world leaders and seeing how they act in simulations. They hope Anadyr's software will help diplomats and politicians make better decisions in crisis and stop wars before they begin. 2. Meta's trying to fix its cringy feed. Meta AI app's public feed was full of personal information that looked to be accidentally published, BI's Katie Notopoulos writes. After BI's story and other media coverage, Meta has added a new warning message. 3. This SpaceX alumni-founded startup raised $10 million in 36 hours. AndrenaM makes software that analyzes sonar data to help spot undersea targets. "Our vision is to secure the oceans," its cofounder and former SpaceX engineer, Matej Cernosek, told BI. 1. Is Target struggling? BI went to find out. Target has had a tough time growing sales over the last two years while competitors Walmart and Costco have reported strong gains. The general state of Target's stores has been an issue for some analysts and customers on social media. BI recently visited three Target stores across the US: Here's what we saw. 2. Microsoft loves the word "Copilot," but a watchdog wants to fix that. Some customers and employees have been criticizing Microsoft's tendency to slap "Copilot" on everything AI. Now, the Better Business Bureau's National Advertising Division, an advertising watchdog, is weighing in — and they're not amused. 3. Ready or not, WhatsApp ads are here. A decade after Meta purchased WhatsApp, the tech giant announced it will begin showing ads in the messaging app's Updates tab, its own version of Instagram Stories. WhatsApp is also rolling out paid subscriptions for Channels. The moves are the most significant monetization push in WhatsApp's history.

Title: What The Cyberattack On UNFI Reveals About The U.S. Grocery Industry

ByErrol Schweizer ByErrol Schweizer, Contributor. Empty shelves at a Texas Whole Foods store. A cyberattack on June 5 crippled United Natural Foods (UNFI), a $30 billion grocery wholesaler and Whole Foods Market’s largest supplier. UNFI also services more than 15,000 other supermarkets, cooperatives, health food stores and chain stores, and the company not yet sure when its ordering and replenishment systems will be able to fully supply its retail customers. Grocers have scrambled to access products from other wholesalers, putting pressure on supply chains throughout the industry. While the cyberattack earned headlines for how it affected shoppers and store operations, the disruption also highlights the role of wholesalers in ensuring a functional U.S. food industry: When a wholesaler like UNFI sneezes, the grocery industry catches a cold. Wholesalers are the vital connection between producers, manufacturers and retailers, and they command significant market access while working hand-in-glove with grocers on a daily basis. Though many retailers still do some of their own wholesale distribution, third parties like UNFI are essential to feeding many Americans. Wholesalers handle millions of cases of product per day. They are large, complex, fast-paced work environments. They have very thin margins. UNFI gross margins typically hovers around 13.5%, a fraction of what retailers and manufacturers run on. Besides UNFI, major wholesalers include $23 billion C&S, which supplies thousands of independent and chain-store supermarkets on the East coast of the U.S., and $50 billion McLane, wholly owned by Berkshire Hathaway and a major supplier to Walmart and Wawa. Others include Spartan Nash, partially owned by Amazon, and UNFI rival KeHe, an employee owned behemoth that services Sprouts, HEB, and thousands of independent natural foods and specialty food stores. These wholesalers supply more than $300 billion a year in retail value, yet they are mostly invisible to consumers. Wholesalers like UNFI and KeHe typically have primary relationships with grocers like Whole Foods and Sprouts, in that they distribute the lion’s share of their center store, beverage, dairy and frozen packaged food products. Grocers sometimes also use direct service snack and beverage operators like Frito-Lay, Pepsi, Snyder’s, Rainforest, and Dora’s Natural, or family owned specialty distributors like Chex Foods, as well as new item innovation focused start-ups like Pod Foods to diversify their supplier base. But the vast rows of empty shelves at Whole Foods and other stores illustrate the reach that primary wholesalers like UNFI have with their retail partners. The retailers typically dictate what the wholesaler sells to them, based on their contractual obligations, their category management strategies, new product launches, private label programs and overall assortment blend by store, region and enterprise — all of which is usually specific to each wholesale warehouse location. The wholesaler in turn controls much of the market access for the thousands of brands and suppliers approved by retail buyers to sell into their stores. In exchange for a low cost-plus markup, the retailer requires most of its suppliers to go through the wholesaler and drive large sales volumes, therefore justifying the low markup. The wholesaler typically guarantees product placement, inventory prioritization and better delivery schedules for its primary customers, especially during weather-related events or other disruptions. This relationship consolidates product distribution, creating a monopoly on supplying products into the grocer’s packaged food and beverage departments. UNFI truck on the New Jersey Turnpike. Wholesalers also tend to manage day to day relationships with suppliers on a more hands-on basis than grocers. When retailers approve placement of a product line in their stores, brands see it as a triumph that they got into the grocer. But this is really just the beginning. They must now keep the grocer happy and fulfill their promotional and inventory commitments and achieve sales and velocity hurdles to stay on shelf. They must also stay on the good side of their wholesale buyers. The wholesaler needs to make a profit and has its own margin model, marketing programs, fees and assorted expenses that suppliers must cover from its gross margin and trade and marketing spends. The markups wholesalers charge retailers are typically well below their cost of doing business. Retailers are under enormous pressure to compete with Walmart, discounters and dollar stores that are growing in market share and siphoning customers away. UNFI’s gross margin is usually in the 13-14% range. Their contractual markup to their largest customer, Whole Foods, is in the 6-7% range and even lower for Whole Foods’ store brand products. On the surface, this means UNFI is losing 6-7 points for every case of product it sends to Whole Foods. UNFI must cover this spread in one of two ways in order to stay operational and earn a profit to keep shareholders happy. One way is by charging disproportionately higher markups to smaller independent retailers who are not part of an advantageous agreement that would bring their markups down. Such one-off independent stores sometimes pay 20-30% markups on the same items that a cost-plus retailer with larger scale pays 6-10% for. It behooves independents to join together and negotiate cooperative cost-plus agreements with wholesalers. Otherwise, it could mean that the retail prices at chain stores such as Kroger or Walmart could be lower than the wholesale cost that an independent grocer is paying, even before they add on their own retail markups. Such revenue streams include strict payment terms, such as a 60 day non-payment window when a product line is launched into retailers, as well as free fills and slotting fees, and various promotional discount models that suppliers must fund, such as MCBs (manufacturer charge backs), Off-Invoice discounts, as well as forward buys and bridge buys, where inventory is bought during discount periods and held to sell at regular prices after discounts periods are over. And then there is a range of obscure, confusing and frustrating accounting and payment practices to suppliers, such as invoice deductions, upcharges and billbacks for unsold, lost or damaged products, or outsourced labor fees for moving products around or between warehouses, called lumper fees. These are all major inside revenue streams for wholesalers that cover the spread between cost-plus markups and their gross margins, and are not discussed on earnings calls or CNBC segments. More empty shelves at Whole Foods. MCBs are a discount structure taken off the inbound cost of the product once it hits the wholesaler’s dock. Unlike off-invoice (OI) discounts, which transparently flow from supplier to wholesaler and on to the retailer and the end consumer, the MCB is billed back to the supplier at an additional retail markup, called the full-wholesale price. On paper, this inflates the cost of the supplier’s product, thereby also inflating the value of the discount that the wholesaler can grab and the supplier must pay, essentially applying a markup on the markdown. A supplier taking 20% off their list cost could end up being billed back for 35-40% of the cost of their product. Many retailers, such as Whole Foods and Sprouts, have gotten wise to MCB practices. But instead of disallowing such markups on supplier markdowns, they just contractually require wholesalers to rebate a portion of their cut back to the retailers, called a true-up. Most items on sale at grocers that pull from UNFI or KeHe are funded by MCB monies. But many suppliers actually prefer the MCB discounts because OI discounts can be worse. Wholesalers and retailers can require suppliers to do regular OI-funded promotions, because they discount the value of the inventory sent to retailers and the accounting is easier. But OI discounts can mean that wholesalers can forward buy large amounts of product on discount just as a sale period is ending, allowing them to sell much of it at a regular price at much higher margins. Or the wholesaler can bridge buy between promotional periods, loading up on enough inventory at the end of one sale period to carry through until the next sales period a few weeks or months down the line, so they never have to buy products at regular cost from suppliers, eating into supplier margins, and all the while selling the products to retailers at a higher margin and not reflecting the discounted inventory to their retail customers or end consumers in the form of in-store sale prices. When a supplier is covering the wholesaler’s bridge buy or forward buy, on top of funding aggressive promotions, such as the BOGO (buy one, get one) offers heavily marketed at Sprouts, it can be devastating to their business. And suppliers will see little to no return on investment on these trade dollars, unless they count not running afoul of their wholesalers as a good use of funds. Fear is also currency. And eventually, this fear translates into higher costs for consumers, as suppliers can only squeeze so much out of their margins before they pass those costs on down the line to consumers, or they can go out of business. In the 19th century, Joseph Schumpeter heralded capitalism as creative destruction. He had no idea how creative that destruction could get. There are plenty of other common wholesaler practices that suppliers, especially independent and family-owned emerging brands, deal with regularly: being charged the same fees twice; being paid late and receiving early payment deductions in spite of this; systematically being withheld payment; paying warehouse activation fees or listing fees/discounts that are not contractually required; getting billed for monthly specials and flyer programs they did not agree to pay for; erroneous deductions with no backups to review, sometimes for thousands of dollars at a time; vague and confusing deduction and billback documentation for shrink or damages; being billed for out of temp product the wholesaler sent to a retailer, especially when the retailers refuse product and send it back to the wholesaler; being billed for free fills and slotting even when retailers have waived such fees; and paying for a highly essential cottage industry of forensic accountants who specialize in billback and deduction audits, dispute resolution and chasing refunds, some of whom are even familial relations to former executives at the very same wholesalers. Such practices have become more commonplace as the wholesaler marketplace has further consolidated into fewer and larger enterprises, such as UNFI’s acquisition of SuperValu, which in turn was encouraged by investors spooked by Amazon buying up UNFI’s largest customer, Whole Foods. Scale begets scale. Suppliers have little say in these matters, except for the occasional eruption of bad PR that is quickly quelled by wholesalers’ supplier relations staff. Retailers are contractually obligated to push suppliers into their primary wholesalers in order to reap the rewards of cost-plus agreements that shave 5-10% in savings on wholesale costs. This savings is material to their pricing strategy, customer retention and profitability. And by controlling market access to select, high profile retailers, wholesalers can make the rules and charge brands whatever this constricted market will bear. And it bears a lot. Empty shelves at Whole Foods. There are few alternatives that can offer the broad range of goods at the low costs retailers are demanding to stay price competitive, especially as climate and trade war inflationary pressures are pushing up costs on key goods like coffee, cocoa, beef, European specialties, imported produce and packaging materials like steel and aluminum. Wholesalers like UNFI and KeHe have swallowed up many independent and cooperative competitors, and wholesale is now one of the most consolidated sectors of the food industry. Some retailers, like HEB and Kroger, still self-distribute high volume packaged food products or have internalized wholesaler operations, such as Stop & Shop and Giant’s parent company Ahold-Delhaize. Some lean on higher cost but more customer-service oriented wholesale operators that provide essential services, such as importation, product sourcing, private labeling, category management and in-store sales and merchandising support. And many retailers have banded together to form wholesale cooperatives that leverage collective scale to access products at competitive prices, such as the Greater Austin Merchants Association, Associated Wholesale Grocers or Twin Cities Co-op Partners. Wakefern, based in New Jersey, is the largest such cooperative, with nearly $20 billion in annual sales via hundreds of independent owner-operated stores such as Fairway and ShopRite. The New York City metro area is uniquely abundant with a number of independent and cooperative wholesale and retail operators. But most U.S. metro areas are not so lucky, dominated not only by a handful of large grocery chains such as Walmart, Costco, Kroger and Albertsons, but also lacking in a diverse array of wholesalers that can supply the wide range of packaged foods that they sell every day. Scale begets scale; market concentration is a self-fulfilling prophecy. And since market concentration also means pricing power, the costs of doing business are passed onto farmers, food workers, small businesses, emerging food brands and cash-strapped consumers, in the form of wage stagnation, higher food prices and draconian fees and invoice deductions. UNFI, after all, is still accountable to its institutional investors and shareholders, who want to see ongoing, profitable growth, no matter what. If grocery market consolidation had a mascot, it would be Robin Hood in reverse. So while UNFI will hopefully recover quickly from the cyberattack and adopt better cyber security measures to ensure that millions of consumers have access to the food the eat everyday, the grocery industry lives with an ongoing structural dilemma. In an era of cybercrime, trade wars, climate change, pandemics and social upheaval, is a consolidated and opaque wholesale grocery sector the best way to stock grocery shelves and keep America fed? We won’t have long to wait for an answer. The next supply chain crisis is only a matter of time.

Title: A Revolutionary Drug for Extreme Hunger Offers Clues to Obesity’s Complexity

Republish This Story Ali Foley Shenk still remembers the panic when her 10-year-old son, Dean, finished a 20-ounce box of raisins in the seconds the cupboard was left unlocked. They rushed to the emergency room, fearing a dangerous bowel impaction. This story also ran on CBS News. It can be republished for free. The irony stung: When Dean was born, he was so weak and floppy he survived only with feeding tubes because he couldn’t suck or swallow. He was diagnosed as a baby with Prader-Willi syndrome — a rare disorder sparked by a genetic abnormality. He continued to be disinterested in food for years. But doctors warned that as Dean grew, his hunger would eventually become so uncontrollable he could gain dangerous amounts of weight and even eat until his stomach ruptured. “It’s crazy,” said Foley Shenk, who lives in Richmond, Virginia. “All of a sudden, they flip.” Prader-Willi syndrome affects up to 20,000 people in the U.S. The most striking symptom is its most life-threatening: an insatiable hunger known as hyperphagia that prompts caregivers to padlock cupboards and fridges, chain garbage cans, and install cameras. Until recently, the only treatment was growth hormone therapy to help patients stay leaner and grow taller, but it didn’t address appetite. In March, the Food and Drug Administration approved Vykat XR, an extended-release version of the existing drug diazoxide choline, which eases the relentless hunger and may offer insights into the biology of extreme appetite and binge eating. This breakthrough for these patients comes as other drugs are revolutionizing how doctors treat obesity, which affects more than 40% of American adults. GLP-1 agonist medications Ozempic, Wegovy, and others also are delivering dramatic results for millions. But what’s becoming clear is that obesity isn’t one disease — it’s many, said Jack Yanovski, a senior obesity researcher at the National Institutes of Health, who co-authored some of the Vykat XR studies. Researchers are learning that obesity’s drivers can be environmental, familial, or genetic. “It only makes sense that it’s complex to treat,” Yanovski said. Subscribe to KFF Health News' free Morning Briefing. Obesity medicine is likely heading the way of treatments for high blood pressure or diabetes, with three to five effective options for different types of patients. For example, up to 15% of patients in the GLP-1 trials didn’t respond to those drugs, and at least one study found the medications didn’t significantly help Prader-Willi patients. Yet, researchers say, efforts to understand how to treat obesity’s many causes and pathways are now in question as the Trump administration is dismantling the nation’s infrastructure for medical discovery. While Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. promotes a “Make America Healthy Again” agenda centered on diet and lifestyle, federal funding for health research is being slashed, including some grants that support the study of obesity. University labs face cuts, FDA staffers are being laid off en masse, and rare disease researchers fear the ripple effects across all medical advances. Even with biotech partnerships — such as the work that led to Vykat XR — progress depends on NIH-funded labs and university researchers. “That whole thing is likely to get disrupted now,” said Theresa Strong, research director for the Foundation for Prader-Willi Research. HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said in a statement that no NIH awards for Prader-Willi syndrome research have been cut. “We remain committed to supporting critical research into rare diseases and genetic conditions,” he said. But Strong said that already some of the contacts at the FDA she’d spent nearly 15 years educating about the disorder have left the agency. She’s heard that some research groups are considering moving their labs to Europe. Early progress in hunger and obesity research is transforming the life of Dean Shenk. During the trial for Vykat XR, his anxiety about food eased so much that his parents began leaving cupboards unlocked. Jennifer Miller, a pediatric endocrinologist at the University of Florida who co-led the Vykat XR trials, treats around 600 Prader-Willi patients, including Dean. She said the impact she’s seen is life-changing. Since the drug trial started in 2018, some of her adult patients have begun living independently, getting into college, and starting jobs — milestones that once felt impossible. “It opens up their world in so many ways.” Over 26 years in practice, she’s also seen just how severely the disease hurts patients. One patient ate a four-pound bag of dehydrated potato flakes; another ingested all 10 frozen pizzas from a Costco pack; some ate pet food. Others have climbed out of windows, dived into dumpsters, even died after being hit by a car while running away from home in search of food. Low muscle tone, developmental delays, cognitive disabilities, and behavioral challenges are also common features of the disorder. Dean attends a special education program, his mother said. He also has narcolepsy and cataplexy — a sudden loss of muscle control triggered by strong emotions. His once-regular meltdowns and skin-picking, which led to deep, infected lesions, were tied to anxiety over his obsessive, almost painful urge to eat. In the trial, though, his hyperphagia was under control, according to Miller and Dean’s mother. His lean muscle mass quadrupled, his body fat went down, and his bone mineral density increased. Even the skin-picking stopped, Foley Shenk said. Vykat XR is not a cure for the disease. Instead, it calms overactive neurons in the hypothalamus that release neuropeptide Y — one of the body’s strongest hunger signals. “In most people, if you stop secreting NPY, hunger goes away,” said Anish Bhatnagar, CEO of Soleno Therapeutics, which makes the medication, the company’s first drug. “In Prader-Willi, that off switch doesn’t exist. It’s literally your brain telling you, ‘You’re starving,’ as you eat.” GLP-1 drugs, by contrast, mimic a gut hormone that helps people feel full by slowing digestion and signaling satiety to the brain. Vykat XR’s possible side effects include high blood sugar, increased hair growth, and fluid retention or swelling, but those are trade-offs that many patients are willing to make to get some relief from the most devastating symptom of the condition. Still, the drug’s average price of $466,200 a year is staggering even for rare-disease treatments. Soleno said in a statement it expects broad coverage from both private and public insurers and that the copayments will be “minimal.” Until more insurers start reimbursing the cost, the company is providing the drug free of charge to trial participants. Soleno’s stock soared 40% after the FDA nod and has held fairly steady since, with the company valued at nearly $4 billion as of early June. While Vykat XR may be limited in whom it can help with appetite control, obesity researchers are hoping the research behind it may help them decode the complexity of hunger and identify other treatment options. “Understanding how more targeted therapies work in rare genetic obesity helps us better understand the brain pathways behind appetite,” said Jesse Richards, an internal medicine physician and the director of obesity medicine at the University of Oklahoma-Tulsa’s School of Community Medicine. That future may already be taking shape. For Prader-Willi, two other notable phase 3 clinical trials are underway, led by Acadia Pharmaceuticals and Aardvark Therapeutics, each targeting different pathways. Meanwhile, hundreds of trials for general obesity are currently recruiting despite the uncertainties in U.S. medical research funding. That brings more hope to patients like Dean. Nearly six years after starting treatment, the now-16-year-old is a calmer, happier kid, his mom said. He’s more social, has friends, and can focus better in school. With the impulse to overeat no longer dominating his every thought, he has space for other interests — Star Wars, American Ninja Warrior, and a healthy appreciation for avocados among them. “Before the drug, it just felt like a dead end. My child was miserable,” Foley Shenk said. “Now, we have our son back.” Share This Story: We want to hear from you: Contact Us Republish This Story By Claire Sibonney June 16, 2025 Ali Foley Shenk still remembers the panic when her 10-year-old son, Dean, finished a 20-ounce box of raisins in the seconds the cupboard was left unlocked.

Meanwhile, hundreds of trials for general obesity are currently recruiting despite the uncertainties in U.S. medical research funding. That brings more hope to patients like Dean. Nearly six years after starting treatment, the now-16-year-old is a calmer, happier kid, his mom said. He’s more social, has friends, and can focus better in school. With the impulse to overeat no longer dominating his every thought, he has space for other interests — Star Wars, American Ninja Warrior, and a healthy appreciation for avocados among them. “Before the drug, it just felt like a dead end.

Title: A revolutionary drug for extreme hunger offers clues to obesity's complexity

Watch CBS News June 16, 2025 / 5:00 AM EDT / KFF Health News Ali Foley Shenk still remembers the panic when her 10-year-old son, Dean, finished a 20-ounce box of raisins in the seconds the cupboard was left unlocked. They rushed to the emergency room, fearing a dangerous bowel impaction. The irony stung: When Dean was born, he was so weak and floppy he survived only with feeding tubes because he couldn't suck or swallow. He was diagnosed as a baby with Prader-Willi syndrome — a rare disorder sparked by a genetic abnormality. He continued to be disinterested in food for years. But doctors warned that as Dean grew, his hunger would eventually become so uncontrollable he could gain dangerous amounts of weight and even eat until his stomach ruptured. "It's crazy," said Foley Shenk, who lives in Richmond, Virginia. "All of a sudden, they flip." Prader-Willi syndrome affects up to 20,000 people in the U.S. The most striking symptom is its most life-threatening: an insatiable hunger known as hyperphagia that prompts caregivers to padlock cupboards and fridges, chain garbage cans, and install cameras. Until recently, the only treatment was growth hormone therapy to help patients stay leaner and grow taller, but it didn't address appetite. In March, the Food and Drug Administration approved Vykat XR, an extended-release version of the existing drug diazoxide choline, which eases the relentless hunger and may offer insights into the biology of extreme appetite and binge eating. This breakthrough for these patients comes as other drugs are revolutionizing how doctors treat obesity, which affects more than 40% of American adults. GLP-1 agonist medications Ozempic, Wegovy, and others also are delivering dramatic results for millions. But what's becoming clear is that obesity isn't one disease — it's many, said Jack Yanovski, a senior obesity researcher at the National Institutes of Health, who co-authored some of the Vykat XR studies. Researchers are learning that obesity's drivers can be environmental, familial, or genetic. "It only makes sense that it's complex to treat," Yanovski said. Obesity medicine is likely heading the way of treatments for high blood pressure or diabetes, with three to five effective options for different types of patients. For example, up to 15% of patients in the GLP-1 trials didn't respond to those drugs, and at least one study found the medications didn't significantly help Prader-Willi patients. Yet, researchers say, efforts to understand how to treat obesity's many causes and pathways are now in question as the Trump administration is dismantling the nation's infrastructure for medical discovery. While Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. promotes a "Make America Healthy Again" agenda centered on diet and lifestyle, federal funding for health research is being slashed, including some grants that support the study of obesity. University labs face cuts, FDA staffers are being laid off en masse, and rare disease researchers fear the ripple effects across all medical advances. Even with biotech partnerships — such as the work that led to Vykat XR — progress depends on NIH-funded labs and university researchers. "That whole thing is likely to get disrupted now," said Theresa Strong, research director for the Foundation for Prader-Willi Research. HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said in a statement that no NIH awards for Prader-Willi syndrome research have been cut. "We remain committed to supporting critical research into rare diseases and genetic conditions," he said. But Strong said that already some of the contacts at the FDA she'd spent nearly 15 years educating about the disorder have left the agency. She's heard that some research groups are considering moving their labs to Europe. Early progress in hunger and obesity research is transforming the life of Dean Shenk. During the trial for Vykat XR, his anxiety about food eased so much that his parents began leaving cupboards unlocked. Jennifer Miller, a pediatric endocrinologist at the University of Florida who co-led the Vykat XR trials, treats around 600 Prader-Willi patients, including Dean. She said the impact she's seen is life-changing. Since the drug trial started in 2018, some of her adult patients have begun living independently, getting into college, and starting jobs — milestones that once felt impossible. "It opens up their world in so many ways." Over 26 years in practice, she's also seen just how severely the disease hurts patients. One patient ate a four-pound bag of dehydrated potato flakes; another ingested all 10 frozen pizzas from a Costco pack; some ate pet food. Others have climbed out of windows, dived into dumpsters, even died after being hit by a car while running away from home in search of food. Low muscle tone, developmental delays, cognitive disabilities, and behavioral challenges are also common features of the disorder. Dean attends a special education program, his mother said. He also has narcolepsy and cataplexy — a sudden loss of muscle control triggered by strong emotions. His once-regular meltdowns and skin-picking, which led to deep, infected lesions, were tied to anxiety over his obsessive, almost painful urge to eat. In the trial, though, his hyperphagia was under control, according to Miller and Dean's mother. His lean muscle mass quadrupled, his body fat went down, and his bone mineral density increased. Even the skin-picking stopped, Foley Shenk said. Vykat XR is not a cure for the disease. Instead, it calms overactive neurons in the hypothalamus that release neuropeptide Y — one of the body's strongest hunger signals. "In most people, if you stop secreting NPY, hunger goes away," said Anish Bhatnagar, CEO of Soleno Therapeutics, which makes the medication, the company's first drug. "In Prader-Willi, that off switch doesn't exist. It's literally your brain telling you, 'You're starving,' as you eat." GLP-1 drugs, by contrast, mimic a gut hormone that helps people feel full by slowing digestion and signaling satiety to the brain. Vykat XR's possible side effects include high blood sugar, increased hair growth, and fluid retention or swelling, but those are trade-offs that many patients are willing to make to get some relief from the most devastating symptom of the condition. Still, the drug's average price of $466,200 a year is staggering even for rare-disease treatments. Soleno said in a statement it expects broad coverage from both private and public insurers and that the copayments will be "minimal." Until more insurers start reimbursing the cost, the company is providing the drug free of charge to trial participants. Soleno's stock soared 40% after the FDA nod and has held fairly steady since, with the company valued at nearly $4 billion as of early June. While Vykat XR may be limited in whom it can help with appetite control, obesity researchers are hoping the research behind it may help them decode the complexity of hunger and identify other treatment options. "Understanding how more targeted therapies work in rare genetic obesity helps us better understand the brain pathways behind appetite," said Jesse Richards, an internal medicine physician and the director of obesity medicine at the University of Oklahoma-Tulsa's School of Community Medicine. That future may already be taking shape. For Prader-Willi, two other notable phase 3 clinical trials are underway, led by Acadia Pharmaceuticals and Aardvark Therapeutics, each targeting different pathways. Meanwhile, hundreds of trials for general obesity are currently recruiting despite the uncertainties in U.S. medical research funding. That brings more hope to patients like Dean.

Title: Refrigerant shortage leaves US consumers at risk of being taken advantage of — how to avoid getting burned

Manage your account ... In the sweltering Las Vegas valley, air conditioning isn't just a luxury; it's a means of survival. “I can’t imagine living in Vegas and not having air conditioning,” local Kaili Bach shared with 8 News Now. Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how I'm 49 years old and have nothing saved for retirement — what should I do? Don't panic. Here are 6 of the easiest ways you can catch up (and fast) Nervous about the stock market in 2025? Find out how you can access this $1B private real estate fund (with as little as $10) So when AC units go on the fritz, residents are likely sweating the cost of a new unit or potential repairs just as much as they’re sweating the heat. And this summer, staying cool could cost more than ever. A nationwide refrigerant shortage, sparked by new federal environmental mandates, is reportedly sending shockwaves through the HVAC industry and straight into consumers’ wallets. The Environmental Protection Agency recently rolled out new standards requiring AC systems to use more eco-friendly refrigerants, and the shift is creating a domino effect of higher prices, compatibility issues and supply snags. “The mandate is calling for a lower GWP, which is a Global Warming Potential refrigerant. That’s what the 454B is,” James Langley, owner of the HVAC company We Care Air, told 8 News Now. “For us, our install guys have to use different installation tools and adjust our pricing. Prices of units have gone up by 30% to 40%.” And that’s not all, as it’s not just the refrigerant that’s in short supply — it's the containers it comes in that are also scarce. “It seems like they don’t have enough cylinders made to keep up with the demand of refrigerant that’s needed on all the new units,” Langley added. For homeowners with older AC units, the problem is even worse. The new refrigerant isn’t compatible with many legacy systems, which leaves fewer options for consumers and plenty of opportunity for price gouging. “People are taking advantage of the situation,” Langley warned. “Let’s say I came to your home and your compressor is out. We can change that compressor, but now there are those who will charge you double because your only alternative is to get a whole new system, which is even more.” The new refrigerant rules — combined with ongoing trade tensions with China, a big supplier of HVAC inventory — are adding fuel to the fire. Langley’s advice? If your AC is still going strong, hold off on upgrading your unit, as Langley is more concerned about those who may experience AC issues in the months ahead.

Dave Ramsey says this 7-step plan ‘works every single time’ to kill debt, get rich in America — and that ‘anyone’ can do it If your AC unit is working overtime, your wallet might be in for a shock this summer. With AC unit prices surging under the new mandatory refrigerant rules, homeowners may need to get strategic. Here’s how to stay cool and save some money at the same time. The Inflation Reduction Act is pumping out hefty HVAC tax credits for 2025. Air source heat pumps are quickly becoming the go-to upgrade for savvy homeowners, delivering both heating and cooling in one energy-efficient system. Federal tax credits have been updated with new eligibility rules, making it the perfect time to cash in while cutting your utility bills. Make sure to check and see if you can get a rebate for replacing an old AC unit or installing new technology. You can either get the money back as a rebate or a tax credit. Don’t let sticker shock force you into an immediate decision. HVAC repairs and replacements can vary, so always get at least a couple of quotes to stay competitive. Many utility companies offer free or low-cost home energy assessments that pinpoint where your system (or insulation, windows and potentially more) is underperforming. Schedule your annual tune-up, which can catch issues early, extend the life of your system and reduce energy waste. Think of it as an oil change for your AC, which is essential and often overlooked. A smart thermostat (like a Nest or Ecobee) adjusts to your habits and slashes energy use. Some utility companies even offer rebates just for installing one. Beyond federal tax credits and rebates, some local power companies and municipal utilities offer their own incentives. You might get cash back for installing high-efficiency AC units, insulation or smart controls like the thermostats mentioned above. To find out what may be available in your area, check the Department of Energy’s website. Even if you’re not a professional, there are a few easy maintenance tasks you can take on yourself, like checking the owner’s manual, keeping the air filters clean or replacing them regularly, and making sure the area around your AC unit is clear of debris so that air can circulate. With smart planning and some well-researched upgrades, you can cool your home without scorching your savings. Claim every credit and rebate that you can, and don’t overpay in a panic. Your future self (and your utility bill) will likely thank you.
