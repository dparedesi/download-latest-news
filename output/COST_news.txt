Manage your account Thousands of drivers across the country are discovering their car paint jobs are literally peeling away — and fixing it could cost them thousands out of pocket. For Ed Rinkowitz, a Florida Hyundai owner, the flaky paint job is a familiar and frustrating sight. I'm 49 years old and have nothing saved for retirement — what should I do? Don't panic. Here are 6 of the easiest ways you can catch up (and fast) Thanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how Want an extra $1,300,000 when you retire? Dave Ramsey says this 7-step plan ‘works every single time’ to kill debt, get rich in America — and that ‘anyone’ can do it “My daughter's hood basically just flaked completely off, probably maybe 10% of the paint was left on it,” Rinkowitz told 10 Tampa Bay. “Then my wife’s car started and that was probably 30 to 40% that was coming off.” Rinkowitz says it’s the third Hyundai in his family with paint issues — and he’s far from alone. A Facebook group called “Hyundai Paint Peel / Peeling” has grown to over 6,000 members, all sharing stories of paint jobs seemingly disintegrating. So what’s causing the problem, and what can drivers do to protect their cars and wallets? While the issue spans several Hyundai models and paint colors, Rinkowitz says two of his affected vehicles were white — a trend echoed by dozens of other drivers. News station 10 Investigates also spoke with owners of Kia, Toyota and Chevrolet vehicles reporting similar issues. Rinkowitz brought his concerns to the dealership, but hit a wall. “I’ve got two white 2015 Elantras, very similar models, and they said, ‘Well, it’s not under warranty,’” he told 10 Investigates. Instead, he was told to go to a body shop — a fix he didn’t feel should fall on him. And it isn’t cheap. According to Bankrate, repainting a car can cost anywhere from $300 to more than $20,000, depending on the vehicle size, paint type and finish. A typical paint job costs around $3,000. A class-action lawsuit has been filed on behalf of Hyundai customers who say their paint peeled off prematurely. In response, some automakers have extended warranties and issued recalls. Hyundai announced a paint warranty extension for eight models, including 2017 and 2018 Elantras, Sonatas and Santa Fes. The coverage applies to peeling or bubbling white paint, especially around the hood, fenders and roof. Other drivers haven’t been as lucky. One Toyota Corolla owner told 10 Investigates that her dealership said the paint recall expired last year — even though her paint is now peeling off her car with just a spray from a garden hose.

In fact, you can get started with as little as $10 — here’s how Whether the issue is a manufacturer defect or not, there are steps car owners can take to help prevent paint damage before it gets worse. Parking in a garage or shaded area helps. Prolonged exposure to sunlight, bird droppings, tree sap and hail can speed up peeling and cracking. UV rays, in particular, cause paint to fade and break down over time. If your car’s paint starts to peel, don’t assume you're out of options. Attorney Charles Gallagher says a denied warranty claim isn’t necessarily the end of the road. He recommends asking the manufacturer for a warranty extension, especially if the issue stems from a known defect in the paint or its application. Automakers have their own processes for addressing paint complaints. Hyundai advises drivers to check their vehicle identification number (VIN) on the company’s website to see if they qualify for a paint warranty extension. Kia recommends starting with your local dealership, but if that doesn’t work, the company encourages contacting its customer care team directly. For now, many drivers are still trying to figure out what to do. “I’m 70 years old. I’ve owned cars since I was like 16 years old,” Rinkowitz said. “I’ve never had a car where the paint flaked off like that.” This tiny hot Costco item has skyrocketed 74% in price in under 2 years — but now the retail giant is restricting purchases.
