[+] Images) On the eve of the NFL playoffs, DraftKings is rolling out an innovative subscription service that brings the high-margin Costco model on recurring subscription revenue into the sports betting ecosystem. Patterned after subscription models at Uber and Robinhood, the company is testing a pilot program in New York aimed at incentivizing rewards for a subset of players. The premium service, DraftKings Sportsbook+, will provide subscribers with “stepped up,” boosts on certain parlays, a preferred wager among Millennial bettors. DraftKings, the first major sportsbook to test the subscription model in the U.S., will offer Sportsbook+ to select customers across the state. “We’re constantly communicating with our customers to understand the products they use and love in their daily lives, and exploring how we can apply those insights to DraftKings,” said Corey Gottlieb, chief product officer at DraftKings. “This process led us to developing a low-cost, recurring subscription designed to provide customers with exceptional value.” After abruptly pulling a proposed customer surcharge over the summer, DraftKings went back to the drawing board. Weeks later, CEO Jason Robins teased the idea at an industry conference without revealing the details. Now, the question is on whether the concept has lasting power. New York handled more than $20 billion in legal sports wagers last year, lapping the field by a wide margin. But DraftKings is not offering the service to every customer in the Empire State. Though the company has not disclosed the percentage of customers who are eligible for the program, there are indications that the current incarnation will just be an “initial test.” Subscribers of DraftKings+ will receive unlimited “boost” tokens that can be applied to parlays, as well as Same Game Parlays, according to the company’s terms and conditions. Customer profits for two-leg parlays will increase by 10%, with step-ups for each leg. As a customer takes on added risk, a bettor’s opportunity for a higher profit will grow exponentially. A bettor that hits a parlay with more than 10 legs will double their profits. The wagers are limited to parlays where each leg has odds of -500 or shorter. The perks are comparable to ones offered with Robinhood Gold, a paid subscription service that debuted in 2016. The online brokerage offers Robinhood Gold subscribers with additional perks such as: IRA matching, lower margins, and a cash sweep program. Through the program, members can earn a 4% annual percentage yield on uninvested brokerage cash that is swept to participating banks. Members of Sportsbook+ will receive ancillary benefits for entering the program, even as some customers question if the monthly fee is too much. It should come as little surprise that DraftKings chose New York for the pilot. In fiscal year 2023, New Year generated $713.5 million in tax revenue from sports betting, according to The Tax Foundation, which bills itself as the nation’s leading voice on tax policy. Only three others – Pennsylvania, Illinois, and New Jersey – eclipsed tax collections above $100 million, the nonprofit found. New York imposes a nation-high 51% tax on sports wagering gross gaming revenues, sharing the top spot with New Hampshire. Many operators have excoriated the rate, contending that it restrains market participants from reinvesting into their companies through advertising and other promotions. “New York will provide an interesting test case for this because you have tremendous volume in critical mass that can hopefully offset some of the burdensome tax rate that the state offers,” said Brendan Bussmann of B Global Advisors. “It’s one of the only ways you can balance the inability to make a profit in the market.” The elevated tax rate generated thoughtful discussion this week on a prominent investor call. If the cost of apples suddenly soars, a major grocery chain such as Kroger may be forced to pass the costs to the customer. Whereas the bulk purchase of 10 apples may have cost Kroger $10 in the past, unexpected supply chain disruptions could send costs soaring to $20 for the same quantity. In that case, a Granny Smith apple that carries a price tag of $1.50 in a produce aisle may jump to around $2.50. Bussmann drew comparisons to Starbucks in enumerating the challenges a sportsbook will face when encountering excessive operating costs. Three years ago, Starbucks raised the prices for certain drinks in response to various micro and macroeconomic concerns, including a hike in minimum wage. At the time, USA Today reported that a venti cappuccino in South Florida went for $4.95, a price even lower than the $5.45 charged for the same cup in New York City. For the DraftKings and the FanDuel’s of the world, the companies can respond by offering less favorable odds to bettors in high-tax jurisdictions. DraftKings floated the idea for a surcharge shortly after Illinois enacted a progressive tax policy last July. Under the policy, Illinois established a tier system with a floor of 20% for operators on the low end of the spectrum. The scale contains numerous step-ups per bracket, with the ceiling at 40% of an operator’s gross gaming revenue (GGR). Speaking at a Bank of America conference weeks later, Robins suggested that it didn’t make sense to “eat any tax increase,” if other states followed. Subscribers of Sportsbook+ will receive the first month for free through a promo code. From there, DraftKings will charge a fee of $20 a month. Once subscribers receive a token that can be applied to various parlays, those bets will be limited to a max wager of $25. Amid rapid digitization and the rise of streaming services, the subscription economy has surged over the last 15 years. A 2022 study from the Harvard Business Review found that the economy for subscription-based products grew at a rate of “five-to-eight,” times than traditional businesses over the previous decade. As sportsbooks engage in a prolonged battle for market share, others may follow the lead of DraftKings. In recent years, online retailers have used subscriptions as a customer retention tool through personalization and enhanced premium benefits. While Robinhood averaged 11 million monthly active users over last year’s third quarter, the company is continually searching for ways to bolster volume. DraftKings is launching the subscription service as Robinhood mulls whether to enter the sports betting game. “I think it is a smart concept as other industries have had success with premium subscription models - Uber, Robinhood, and Twitter/X,” Craig-Hallum Senior Research Analyst Ryan Sigdahl told me. “Hell, it is Costco’s business, investors love high-margin, recurring subscription revenue.” Sigdahl believes the service could be a value-add for high-volume players, while helping the company drive loyalty. Still, he is unsure if bettors will be willing to pay more just for the opportunity to bet at better odds, albeit with negative expected value (EV). On Twitter, bettors appeared split with the prospects. One bettor griped at paying a premium for high-risk parlays, while another took exception to paying $20 a month when DraftKings estimated it would generate revenue of nearly $5 billion last year. Conversely, a Silicon Valley venture capital associate lauded DraftKings for its ingenuity in crafting the idea. James Kaplan, a tech investor at Menlo Park firm NEA, drew comparisons with Uber One, a membership experience plan launched in 2021. Uber One members receive a 5% discount in certain eligible trips through Uber One credits. There, DraftKings takes a page from Uber with its “stepped up boosted tokens,” for select parlays. In November, Uber announced that the membership program had more than 25 million members, representing a year-over-year increase of 70% from the third quarter of 2023. Months earlier, the company pledged to offer more perks after membership fees topped a run rate of $1 billion. At times, Uber One membership has comprised more than 25% of the overall customer base for the ride-sharing giant. Based on the figures, DraftKings could reap a considerable windfall if a minimum of 30% of New York customers subscribe to the service. Under a bullish scenario, DraftKings could retain $10-$15 per subscription after accounting for customer payouts. If considerations such as customer loyalty and user engagement are factored, the value of the subscription could be as much as 2-3x of the collected payment, according to industry estimates. DraftKings averaged monthly unique payers (MUPs) of 3.6 million in the third quarter of last year. Creative marketing could enable DraftKings and FanDuel to widen the gap between competitors. Also this week, DraftKings unveiled a partnership with Delta that will result in the placement of various DraftKings’ games on Delta seatback screens (FAA regulations prohibit real-money wagers when a flight is airborne). The two sports betting giants enter 2025 with an online sports betting market share of around 80%. If the two establish a duopoly in the coming years, investors may start to apply higher multiples to the companies, more in line with digital companies such as Uber, JMP Securities analyst Jordan Bender wrote in a research note. The concept of loss aversion may also be closely monitored as the industry evaluates the implications of the subscription service. A bettor who plays all six Wild Card favorites in a parlay this weekend will receive a payout of +794 at DraftKings ($10 to win $89.43). The customer will qualify for the profit boost since the Ravens (Moneyline -500) are the largest favorite on the board. A bettor can parlay the NFL favorites with a bevy of singles matches at the Australian Open, but will be only allowed to place certain ones. Consider a 12-team parlay with six opening-round favorites: Jannik Sinner (-5000), Casper Ruud (-600), Tommy Paul (-525), Karen Khachanov (-800), Madison Keys (-700), and Jasmine Paolini (-525). A 12-team parlay will pay +1839 ($10 to win $193.93). The bettor, however, will not be eligible for the boost since each leg is above the -500 threshold. Conversely, the bettor can substitute the tennis stars with six other favorites. Instead, let’s say the bettor opts to use Jessica Pegula (-450), Naomi Osaka (-450), Donna Vekic (-400), Elina Svitolina (-380), Frances Tiafoe (-380), and Reilly Opelka (-330). The massive parlay has odds of +3372 ($10 to win $347.21). This parlay will qualify for the profit boost. An astute tennis bettor will be shocked if Sinner, the defending champion, is upset in the first round. A defeat by someone such as Vekic or Opelka is more common given the depth in pro tennis. The restrictions prevent a bettor from placing a chalky parlay that ventures into positive-EV territory. Leading books have grappled with unfavorable sports outcomes in recent quarters. The trends prompted DraftKings and Flutter to revise their 2024 U.S. financial guidance. As for the profit boosts, it is not uncommon for companies in other industries to charge larger fees for certain trades. Robinhood, for example, charges more for option trading activity than for stock trades. Retail brokerages make money by selling customer orders to market makers, which make a profit on option orders. In turn, market makers tend to make a larger profit on options due to wider spreads. Robinhood charges $0.00016 per share for equity sells, which is far less than the $0.00279 per contract on option sells. The platform handles hundreds of millions in options contracts traded per quarter. It also charges $0.04 in options regulatory and OCC clearing fees. The New York State Gaming Commission (NYSGC) approved DraftKings’ subscription plan, Covers.com reported. Although the subscription fee will not be subject to the state’s 51% sports betting tax, operator revenue from wagers placed within the plan will be, an NYSGC spokesperson told Covers. One question for regulators in other states is whether the subscription is directly linked to betting activity. If so, a regulator could subject the fee to the same tax treatment as sports wagering. Sigdahl can see the concept possibly passing by state gaming tax, while Bussmann views a scenario where others could follow New York. “If this works in New York, I could see DraftKings rolling this out to states like Illinois and others that have high tax rates, with the eventual goal to roll it out across the entire portfolio of states,” Bussmann predicts. As with companies such as Robinhood, DraftKings can broaden the subscription service with other perks. Mike Dzikowski, a self-proclaimed DraftKings armchair CEO, suggests that the operator can add sweeteners such as bet insurance to the subscription program. Investors should expect more clarity from DraftKings when the company releases 2024 fourth-quarter results next month. “As we test this new offering, we’ll refine our approach in order to provide the most engaging customer experience,” Gottlieb explained.

Title: Costco Sales Jump on a Shift in the Holiday Shopping Season

Time Published: 2025-01-09T19:37:55Z

Costco continued its winning streak in December thanks to a delayed holiday shopping season in 2024, with Cyber Monday falling in the last month of the year rather than in November. E-commerce led to comparable sales gains for the five weeks, up 34.4 percent, followed by a 9.3 percent gain in U.S. and 4.3 percent in Canadian sales. The company attributed the strong e-commerce sales in December to the positive impact of an estimated 15 percentage points due to Thanksgiving, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday in 2024 occurring a week later than in 2023. However, the wholesale club has consistently reported solid online and in-store sales in recent months, meaning that the robust December numbers are part of an ongoing trend rather than an aberration. The sales results sent Costco’s shares nearly 2 percent higher in after-hours trading. The stock is up 41.37 percent over the past 12 months and 218.30 percent over five years, beating the S&P 500, up 25.99 percent and 82.82 percent over the corresponding periods. Costco is in the right place at the right time and has the right value proposition for its customers. The place is merging online and offline sales, where shoppers can order merchandise online and pick it up in local stores the same day. This strategy has helped traditional brick-and-mortar store chains such as Costco, Walmart, and Target fend off Amazon’s challenge, as the e-commerce giant doesn’t have an extensive brick-and-mortar presence. Then there’s Costco’s value proposition, the relentless pursuit for superior product quality and customer services provided by dedicated employees, which create an exceptional shopper experience worth a membership fee. “Costco’s strong December performance, with a 34.4 percent jump in e-commerce sales, reflects the strength of its business model and culture,” Georgios Koimisis, associate professor of economics and finance at Manhattan University, told The Epoch Times. “The company’s focus on delivering value, fair wages, and trust has built loyalty among employees and customers. Its ability to adapt to shifts, such as the later timing of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, and quickly pass cost savings to shoppers underscores its resilience.” The company’s focus on superior product quality is also reflected in the pace at which it opens new stores. Unlike other traditional retailers, which open stores at a feverish pace, Costco opens stores slowly. It currently operates 897 warehouses, including 617 in the United States and Puerto Rico, 109 in Canada, 41 in Mexico, 36 in Japan, 29 in the UK, 19 in Korea, 15 in Australia, 14 in Taiwan, 7 in China, 5 in Spain, 2 in France, and 1 each in Iceland, New Zealand, and Sweden. Costco also operates e-commerce sites in the United States, Canada, the UK, Mexico, Korea, Taiwan, Japan, and Australia. However, Koimisis sees a few challenges ahead for the wholesale club’s growth, such as tariffs, inflation, and supply chain disruptions that could create significant cost pressures, making it harder to sustain current pricing strategies. “Expanding the Kirkland Signature private-label brand could be a key strategy to address these challenges, offering affordable, high-quality alternatives to national brands while reducing reliance on external suppliers,” he said. “Simultaneously, diversifying supply chains and investing in technology to manage bottlenecks will be essential.”

Title: How I Keep our Big Family Grocery Budget Low

Heavenly Homemakers Encouraging women in homemaking, healthy eating and parenting January 6, 2025 by Laura 1 Comment This is how I keep our big family grocery budget low… Perhaps when you see our large grocery budget number, you don’t see it as a low number. It’s all relative, right? It is large for a regular-sized family. But for our big family? I think we do a pretty good job of keeping it as low as we can. Aww, a look at our beloved 19: We are so grateful to live close to Asa, Eva, and Arrow and Justus, Kelsey, and Little Sweetheart! Our budget for 2024 was $1,400/month. You can see the total numbers here sharing what each month looked like. You might notice if you divide my total 2024 spending amount by 12 months that I actually averaged a bit lower per-month amount than I budgeted. As I look ahead to 2025, I’m looking at how it worked to maintain that budget plus I’m considering these… I still plan to keep our grocery budget at $1,400/month right now and see how long that works for us. I will make adjustments during the year if this doesn’t work or if it is causing stress. Our energy and mental space needs to be used to care for our family and others – not for crunching numbers and worrying over nickels and dimes. I’ve been thinking about all that is working for me as I try to stick to a healthy grocery budget for our household and I came up with a lot of details to share! After settling into our new Lincoln home and finding my way with new-to-me grocery stores and a new shopping system that works for our needs, this is what I’ve found that works to feed 13 of us with a $1,400/month budget. 1. I always look for meat markdowns. Buying discounted meat is probably what saves our family the most money on groceries. I settled on this price point for meat, and I am determined to almost never go over. See the exception here. But with this in mind, I have found that if I look for meat that has been marked down for quick sale – specifically at Aldi, Walmart, or Sam’s – I can almost always buy meat for our family marked down to $2.50/pound or less. This is even less than my price point, and the savings are huge! These yellow stickers are my favorite! And I’ve found that if I shop in the mornings, that’s when there are the most yellow stickers as the stores clear out their packages of meat that are nearing the “best by” date. I grab them up and freeze them to use as needed. HUGE SAVINGS. The best mark down I’ve found: for two years in a row, we’ve scored $0.50/pound ham after Christmas. We fill our freezers. One ham goes a long way, even for a large family! Every once in a while, other stores in town (that I don’t frequent regularly) will offer a big meat sale. If the deals are good, I find it worth it to make an extra stop to take advantage. 2. We shop in bulk. Having a Sam’s or Costco membership may not pay for itself for some families. But for us? The savings are big and very worth it. I now know which items are priced best at Sam’s, which are best at Costco, and which are better at other stores. Buying large quantities of many of our staples cuts down our cost and is also helpful for my planning needs. It takes a lot of mental pressure off my brain if I know that I have twelve of something in my pantry ready to grab as needed. It usually takes two carts to get everything we need at Costco or Sam’s each month. 3. I have learned what items are cheapest at which stores. After living in Lincoln for a year-and-a-half, I’ve learned which prices are best at which store for the products we use and need. My favorite places to shop are Sam’s, Costco, and Aldi with a little Walmart thrown in for those awesome meat markdowns! Typically, I keep running lists on my phone of what I need at each store. I shop once each week, but go to a different store each time. So usually we hit Costco and Sam’s just once in a month, Aldi twice and Walmart twice. This works well for our budget and plans! 4. We eat as many fruits and veggies as we can. People don’t believe me when I say that fruits and veggies save money because everyone thinks “healthy food is expensive.” I disagree when it comes to fruits and veggies. Where we shop, apples, bananas, carrots, pears, grapes, fresh spinach, mixed greens, and potatoes are all consistently low in price per pound. Frozen fruits and veggies cost the same all year round. And we buy everything else in season when their prices are the lowest and featured in a sale. Kids need something to hold them over until lunch? Here’s an apple: Also, I’ve found that it’s easiest to feed a large crowd of people (which for us is 13 to 30 or more people per meal) when I set out the main dish and a variety of fruit and/or veggie side dish options. This stretches the meal to feed a lot of people, plus offers variety, gives people choices, and overall saves money. 5. I say yes to offers of free food that would otherwise go to waste. Say what? Well, we stand out as a large family with “a lot of mouths to feed.” Therefore, people often think of us when there is extra food that will get thrown away after an event at church or at people’s places of work. Our neighbor is often stopping by with something from his work’s break room that is perfectly good to eat but is about to get tossed because no one wants it. “Wait! I’ll take it to the Coppingers!” says he, and he does. After a potluck or church event? People hand us leftovers. “Here, use this for your next Sunday lunch,” they’ll say. Or, “Will your family eat this? We hate to throw it away.” YEP. We say yes to most offers like this because we don’t like food going in the trash and because I can make a meal with just about anything if I get creative. In addition, we bring home food from the Food Distribution site where we volunteer each week. All the food there is donated by grocery stores and restaurants if it is an item close to its expiration date or otherwise unable to be sold. This food is going to be thrown away if not given to the community! I can’t tell you how grateful we are that Lincoln has the FoodNet program to cut down on food waste and to provide for the community instead. Typically each week at the location where we serve, over 100 families go through the line to get food. We, as volunteers, get to pick out some of the food too if there is enough. And at the end of the hour when all of the clients have gone through the line, if there is anything left, volunteers can go through the line again. We bring home a random assortment of food each week – sometimes just a little and sometimes several bags worth. I usually need to find ways to use up this food or freeze it pretty quickly because it’s food that is on its last leg. But it was free and it’s fun and it didn’t go into a grocery store dumpster. Worth noting: sometimes I say yes to food handouts even if I know our family won’t eat it because I know people who will eat it. We regularly buy extra or stockpile food we’ve been given to take to our church’s Little Free Pantry. It’s so good for our kids to be a part of the ministry of caring for others and loving people in our neighborhood. Almost every time we are at the pantry filling it up, we meet up with someone who is coming there to check for food to use for their next meal. It’s amazing and we love visiting with these new friends. 6. WIC Our three youngest kids qualify for WIC through their adoption subsidy (and will until they turn five). This gives them fresh produce, cheese, eggs, milk, rice/pasta/bread, and beans and totals around $150/month in benefits. This is a lovely resource we are thankful to enjoy for our kids. 7. I only buy organic if it fits into the budget. I used to overthink this and feel guilty. But God has taken this guilt away though because He’s taught me that loving people is much more important than obsessing over food. Yes, I want to take good care of our bodies. I absolutely try to fill us all with nourishing foods every day. But my focus is more on meeting our kids’ emotional needs than worrying over an organic label on our food. We also want to continue to fill our home and tables with dear friends who join us for meals frequently. We want to feed our guests well, but spending extra to be sure everything is organic would not work for our budget. I won’t trade an organic label for inviting people into our home to share our food. I’m thankful that many organic foods DON’T cost more – like apples, spinach, mixed greens, salsa, pasta sauce, and carrots. I get them regularly and other organic items if I can. But if I buy pears that aren’t organic, I’m no longer worried. We’re still eating pears. Pears are healthy. God takes care of the rest. 8. We always eat at home or pack food if we’re on the road. Buying restaurant food is not an option for us right now, and we are very ok with that. ( Think eating out would double our grocery budget. Plus can you imagine taking this many high-need kids into a restaurant? Phew.) Instead, we’ve found all kinds of other ways to make food fun, to offer all of us treats, and to even pretend we are having fast food. (Bulk bags of chicken nuggets and fries from Costco are crazy cheap compared to feeding 13 people at Wendy’s – and they taste better too.) I’ve found so many ways to make food prep simple that I never feel like I want to order take-out. If I ever need a night off from cooking (which, of course, I do), we bake Costco frozen pizzas. They are super cheap compared to ordering pizza and we love how they taste. Costco or Sam’s $5 Rotisserie Chicken is also a great fast food option that goes a long way! Exception to never eating out: There are a few times each year that we find ourselves on the road with the need to stop and get a bunch of McDonald’s nuggets or something like this. We aren’t legalistic about not eating out. We just choose not to most of the time and enjoy coming up with all kinds of other fun options to eat or pack instead! 9. We eat leftovers. I mentioned above that we don’t like it when food goes to waste. Therefore, we put all of our leftovers from meals into our fridge to warm up another time. Matt and I are stay at home /work from home parents, and we almost always warm up leftovers for our lunch. Elias often packs leftovers to take to work for lunch. And whenever our fridge starts to get over full, instead of cooking something new, we have a meal in which we pull out all the leftovers and warm them up for people to help themselves to whatever sounds good. I’ve also found creative ways to turn leftover food into a brand new meal: like turning a Taco Bar into a casserole or a bunch of burritos for the freezer, taking leftover ham to make Ham and Potato Casserole or Breakfast Casserole. It’s pretty easy to turn leftovers into something new. 10. I make good use of our freezers. If there’s a good sale (or a good deal on meat, as if I haven’t talked about that enough, ha), I stock up and fill the freezer. If I’m making one casserole or batch of muffins, I often make two or three while I’m at it to get more meals prepped for the same amount of work. I put the extras into the freezer for a convenient fast food another day. Frozen casseroles/muffins/breads also give me the option of providing others with meals if I find out of a need – a sick friend, a new mama, or a hurting friend. 11. I use credit for Azure Standard purchases. This is only worth a tiny mention as it doesn’t affect our budget much. But I do accrue a small amount of referral credit to Azure Standard when any of you sign up for an account and/or take advantage of what Azure has to offer. About twice a year, the credit number adds up to enough for me to put in an order that is mostly covered by the credit. Their food is great and some of it I can only find through Azure, so these are the items I stock up on when I can! Stay tuned for our weekly posts to see what we’re eating and who we’re feeding. And watch for our monthly posts sharing what we buy and how much we spend. We’ll see if our monthly $1,400/month budget holds! What are the best ways you’ve found to save money at the grocery stores where you live? Filed Under: Big Family Food, Feeding the Family Tagged With: frugal budget, grocery budget, large family food, saving money on groceries Amber says January 7, 2025 at 5:45 pm That is a very good budget for the amount of people you feed. Do you use a separate budget for nonfood household items and needs or is it included. I have a family of 7 children (3 teens) and two adults. I am working keeping ours down and having more fruits and vegetables. My younger children tend to go through fruit in one day it seems like a bag of mandarins for instance. We are also a neurodivergent family. God Bless! Your email address will not be published.
