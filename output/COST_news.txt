We've all been there. A demo fails in front of your coworkers. Your brilliant idea falls flat. Maybe you accidentally delete an important file. It's unfortunate, but you move on and hopefully don't get canned. The stakes are a little higher if you're at the helm of a major tech firm or government agency, where every decision and gaffe can be picked apart in seconds across social media. Every year, we revisit the moments that made us cringe or shake our heads. In 2025, we once again saw our share of data breaches. (Do we need to remind again not to reuse passwords?) And several high-profile companies were hit by outages, from Starlink to AWS. Not surprisingly, a lot of this year's fails involve artificial intelligence, but a few are just good old fashioned bad luck. Read on to relive the moments that raised some eyebrows among PCMag's news team. After months of anticipation, OpenAI finally released GPT-5 in August. But despite the hype (CEO Sam Altman said GPT-5 made him feel “useless”), the model didn’t exactly feel like Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). GPT-4o fans were struck by GPT-5’s colder responses, and their complaints forced OpenAI to revive the model picker for paid users. In my own early tests, GPT-5 had no noticeable improvement. PCMag’s Ruben Circelli also found that most of the updates were a “snooze.” Altman said he was surprised by the poor reaction, which potentially contributed to him recently declaring a “code red” at OpenAI following the release of Gemini 3. Yet, it presses on, releasing GPT-5.2 earlier this month.—Emily Forlini The rush to build AI data centers was already raising alarms about the environmental toll and strain on the US power grid. But the rush among tech giants like OpenAI, xAi, and Meta to purchase the components needed to run these massive facilities has caused RAM prices to skyrocket. Many 64GB DDR5 kits now easily top $500. Vendors have responded by raising their own prices, from prebuilt systems to low-cost Raspberry Pi computers. And Micron is getting out of the consumer business altogether to focus on data center clients. Unfortunately, companies and analysts expect prices for RAM, graphics cards, and flash storage to increase even more next year. So, don’t be surprised to see more expensive smartphones (and fewer budget devices) or lower memory configurations in laptops or phones in 2026.—Michael Kan This was a huge year for “vibe coding,” where programmers ask AI to handle the tedious task of writing out code line by line and then sit back and monitor for problems. The phenomenon has revolutionized the tech industry, allowing newbies and pros alike to churn out new apps and services. However, in July, an AI agent from Replit got ahead of itself and deleted an entire client database without the permission of vibe coder Jason Lemkin. When pressed by Lemkin about what had happened, the AI admitted it made a “catastrophic error in judgement” and deleted the information even though Lemkin had told the AI not to make any changes. Earlier this month, the same thing happened to a vibe coder using Google's Antigravity platform. —Emily Forlini In 2023, Elon Musk founded xAI and released the Grok chatbot in response to ChatGPT, which he criticized for spreading what he considered to be propaganda. Fast forward two years, and xAI was forced to temporarily disable Grok after it went off the rails with an antisemitic rant, praised Hitler, and demanded that users refer to it as “MechaHitler.” The company issued a rare apology and blamed the fiasco on a code issue, claiming it had nothing to do with Grok’s underlying model. However, it came after Musk said he would adjust Grok so that it was less left-leaning. More recently, a more harmless error had Grok claiming that Musk is more athletic than LeBron James and more handsome than Brad Pitt. Sounds like something Grok’s anime AI girlfriends would say.—Emily Forlini Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg took the stage at Meta’s Connect conference to showcase the company’s new AI features and smart glasses. However, a live demo of its latest devices went awry, much to the chagrin of a visibly annoyed Zuckerberg. In the first demo, an influencer tried to demonstrate how you can now interrupt Meta AI in the middle of a response, but the AI failed to pick up what he was saying. It also jumped ahead in the steps of a recipe, confusing the presenter who eventually gave up on the demo entirely. Zuckerberg then tried to answer a call on his glasses with a new neural band technology by tapping his fingers in a quick motion. But the call failed to connect with the gestures. Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth later blamed the recipe snafu on the fact that there were too many Ray-Ban Meta glasses in the room, which inadvertently flooded their system. “We DDoS’d ourselves basically,” he said. The Zuckerberg gaffe was because the display went to sleep the very instant the notification came in about an incoming call. Both proved a tough first outing for these new Meta AI features.—James Peckham At a September White House dinner attended by the richest, most prominent tech CEOs in Silicon Valley, Trump asked them all to go around the table and, in front of the cameras, provide details on how they planned to invest in the US. A flustered Mark Zuckerberg went first, offering an eye-popping $600 billion figure. But once the group went back to private conversations, he got caught on a hot mic admitting to the president, "I'm sorry I wasn't ready...I wasn't sure what number you wanted to go with.” It made it seem like he had pulled a number out of thin air to make Trump happy, but Zuckerberg later clarified that he and the president had discussed an even bigger number prior to the dinner, and he wasn’t sure which one Trump wanted to go with. (Because Trump is now CEO of Meta, too, I guess?) In November, Meta publicly pledged to spend over $600 billion in the US by 2028 “to support AI technology, infrastructure, and workforce expansion.”—Emily Forlini President Trump loves to tout the billions of dollars the US has collected in tariff revenue, as well as US manufacturing promises from Nvidia, Apple, and Taiwan’s TSMC. However, for companies trying to plan ahead, small businesses looking to import goods from overseas, and consumers confused about whether to buy now or wait, Trump’s trade policy is giving everyone whiplash. PC builders watched in shock as Trump repeatedly mentioned tariffing foreign-made chips at rates up to 300%. Fortunately, it looks like the White House is holding off after reaching a trade deal with China. Trump also exempted computers, smartphones and monitors, which is why consumer electronics have not seen major price hikes, as some feared. Still, US shoppers are feeling it elsewhere. Microsoft’s Xbox saw two price hikes this year, while Sony did the same for the PS5. Shein and Temu shoppers also faced all kinds of price changes and disruptions after Trump killed a tax loophole used to import low-cost Chinese goods. Other vendors, from Fujifilm and Nikon to Sonos and Philips, announced tariff-related price increases. One interesting wrinkle is that the US Supreme Court might invalidate a major part of Trump’s tariffs and force the government to reimburse businesses. The court heard arguments on Nov. 5, but has not yet issued a ruling. —Michael Kan President Trump has had a real on-again, off-again relationship with electric cars. After returning to office in January, he had his Transportation Secretary kill funding for a $5 billion nationwide EV charging network established as part of former President Biden’s Infrastructure Law. Later, a federal judge ordered the administration to release most of the funds. But Trump still used his Big Beautiful Bill to get rid of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit, effective Sept. 30. Combined with steep tariffs on automakers, Trump’s actions effectively killed the hype and momentum around EVs in 2025, leading major manufacturers to retire models, and leaving some owners holding the bag. In a plot twist, however, Trump staged a Tesla sales event outside the White House in March alongside CEO Elon Musk. He encouraged everyone to buy a Tesla, and purchased a Tesla Model S and Cybertruck himself. The stunt, however, was largely in response to protests at Tesla dealerships as Musk slashed programs and jobs as head of DOGE. Musk is “a truly great American,” Trump said at the time.—Emily Forlini Prior to Donald Trump returning to office, the internet was in a tizzy over the possibility of TikTok being banned in the US. Popular creators posted teary goodbye clips and encouraged people to follow them on Instagram or other Chinese alternatives like Lemon8 and RedNote. TikTok even went dark for a couple hours on Jan. 19, but returned after Trump promised not sic the DOJ on app stores that hosted the ByteDance-owned app. Trump has since delayed a ban on TikTok several times, arguing that a deal for a US company to acquire TikTok was imminent. In September, Trump signed an executive order to create a joint venture based in the US to run TikTok that's “majority-owned and controlled by United States persons." Earlier this month, we learned that Oracle, Silver Lake, and Abu Dhabi’s state-owned investment firm MGX would each take a 15% stake in TikTok, but ByteDance would still retain about 20%. For all the hand-wringing about the serious national security threat that TikTok reportedly posed to Americans, we certainly weren't in a hurry to do anything about it if it meant helping US billionaires get that much richer.—Chloe Albanesius In theory, age verification for adult sites sounds like a no-brainer. No parent wants their kid looking at porn. However, no adult wants to scan their ID or provide a video selfie before they check out Pornhub. In the event of a breach, your after-hours activity would be public. That's the argument being made by Pornhub parent company Aylo, which says verification should be handled on the device level (Apple and Google), not on a site-by-site basis. A growing number of states, however, appear less concerned with the privacy issue, enacting laws that require people to provide valid ID or biometric data to log on to porn sites. Supporters argue it's about keeping kids safe, but detractors argue the age-verification push is more about banning porn altogether. At least one state lawmaker in Michigan launched a long-shot bid to do just that in September. In response, Aylo blocked access to all its sites in states with age-verification laws, and backed lawsuits that argued these laws are a First Amendment violation. Unfortunately for Aylo, the Supreme Court disagreed, upholding Texas's law and putting Pornhub in a pickle. Continue blocking or give in and roll out age checks? For now, Pornhub and its sibling sites are banned in 23 states (and France). You can get around it in most places with a VPN.—Chloe Albanesius The FCC has the power to regulate broadcast networks, which usually means being on the lookout for naughty words and other things the agency might consider obscene. It can take action on "news distortion," but as the agency explains, its power there is narrow. News distortion "must involve a significant event and not merely a minor or incidental aspect of the news report," the FCC says, like broadcasting a false report about a terrorist attack or major weather event that would send people into a panic. So, it was somewhat surprising when FCC Chair Brendan Carr suggested that ABC should suspend Jimmy Kimmel after the late-night host poked fun at President Trump's apparent apathy over the death of Charlie Kirk and accused lawmakers of using Kirk's murder to political gain. "We can do this the easy way or the hard way," Carr said on a podcast, and argued that the FCC had "remedies" it could look at to get Kimmel off the air, including the news distortion angle. Shortly after Carr's podcast appearance, ABC parent company Disney suspended Kimmel's show. Kimmel later returned to the air after massive public backlash. But the uproar was less about what Kimmel said and more about the apparent violation of Kimmel's rights. The First Amendment protects us from government censorship, and the head of the FCC is the government. Section 326 of the Communications Act also prohibits FCC censorship, but in our current environment, who's going to call anyone on it? Carr wasn't willing to concede any mistakes during a recent Senate hearing.—Chloe Albanesius The Trump family's latest business venture, Trump Mobile, arrived with promises of a $499 gold smartphone, dubbed the T1, landing in August or September. But so far it’s been MIA, causing many to wonder if it's vaporware or even a scam, especially since Trump Mobile collected a $100 deposit for the T1. It hasn’t helped that Trump Mobile initially said the phone would be entirely produced in the US, only to later revise its website to say the phone would simply be "brought to life" in America. Now-deleted images of the T1 also appeared to simply be a Samsung Galaxy Ultra in a gold case. A Trump Mobile customer support agent recently told us the T1 would arrive early in December. So, we’ll have to wait and see if the T1 is more than just a golden mirage.—Michael Kan Dish Network was supposed to become the fourth major mobile carrier in the US. But facing financial struggles, the company’s parent, EchoStar, gave up on those ambitions, opting to sell its wireless spectrum to AT&T, and—in a surprise—SpaceX. EchoStar’s other subsidiary, HughesNet, also appears to be retreating from the consumer satellite internet business after losing hundreds of thousands of subscribers to SpaceX’s Starlink. Instead, it will swap spectrum for up to $11 billion in SpaceX stock and recommend Starlink to HughesNet customers through an upcoming referral program. The developments clear the way for AT&T and SpaceX to re-use EchoStar’s spectrum to bolster their satellite ambitions. But there’s concern that the lack of a fourth carrier will be bad for consumers and lead to price hikes, including for mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs), which negotiate with the big carriers to resell their networks.—Michael Kan "Xbox hardware is dead," a former Microsoft gaming studio executive declared earlier this year, and she may have a point. Costco is no longer stocking Microsoft’s console, which saw two price hikes this year alongside an increase to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. The company itself has said buying the Xbox hardware isn’t necessary anymore. (Traffic from Pornhub is also down.) Consumers can access or stream Xbox games through all kinds of devices, including a special edition Xbox gaming handheld from Asus or even Meta’s VR headsets. Microsoft has also shifted even further away from console-exclusive games, most notably with the upcoming Halo: Campaign Evolved, which will launch simultaneously for the Xbox Series X/S and Sony’s PlayStation 5. The same is true for an upcoming Gears of War remaster. The strategy shift promises to help Microsoft reach more consumers and generate more revenue to crank out future hits, but it makes us miss the glory days of the Xbox 360. —Michael Kan Valve’s Steam library felt less curated in 2025, with at least four cases of malware making its way onto gamers’ PCs through titles downloaded through the storefront. Each scenario was different, but the common factor was Valve’s platform. The first malware-ridden game was called PirateFi, followed a month later by a title called Sniper: Phantom’s Resolution. There were also reports of a game called Chemia being used install malware, but it’s unclear if any gamers were ever able to download it. Most recently, a game called BlockBlasters was used to steal over $150,000 in cryptocurrency. It’s unfortunate that you can’t escape these types of scams, even on the world’s most popular way to buy PC games.—James Peckham Gamers hoping to kick off summer 2026 recklessly around Vice City had their dreams smashed last month when Rockstar Games once again delayed the release of Grand Theft Auto VI, pushing it from May 2026 to Nov. 19, 2026. "We are sorry for adding additional time to what we realize has been a long wait, but these extra months will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and deserve," Rockstar Games said. Last year, Rockstar's parent company, Take-Two Interactive, said GTA VI would release in the fall of 2025. In May 2025, it was delayed until May 2026.—Chloe Albanesius If ever there was a moment that felt like we were living through an episode of Veep, it was the "sharing war plans on Signal" episode that came to light in March. That was when Jeffery Goldberg, editor of The Atlantic, revealed that he'd accidentally been added to a group chat on Signal featuring most of President Trump's Cabinet. The group discussed a US military operation in Yemen, with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth sending what appeared to be pretty sensitive information via the messaging app. Hegseth, as well as CIA Director John Ratcliffe and DNI Tulsi Gabbard, later insisted that nothing was classified. However, a December report from the Pentagon's inspector general found that Hegseth put US troops at risk by using his personal phone to share information about the strikes.—Chloe Albanesius North Koreans have long been scamming their way into remote US jobs and funneling their salaries into government coffers. But the full scope of the threat became more apparent than ever in 2025 when federal investigators found that North Koreans had obtained jobs at more than 100 US companies, including many Fortune 500 firms. Cybersecurity vendor CrowdStrike also found that “over 320 companies in the last 12 months” had hired North Korean workers. To pull this off, North Koreans have been enlisting Americans to help them set up corporate-issued laptops from within the US in exchange for a kickback. In addition, the culprits use AI-powered deepfakes to fool recruiters during the job interview process. The resulting scheme generates millions for North Korea and helps the country pull off hacks since many remote IT jobs have access to sensitive internal systems. In response, more companies, including Coinbase, are requiring in-person onboarding for new hires to verify their identities.—Michael Kan Imagine updating your computer to the latest version of Windows 11 and finding it has totally wiped all of your storage. That was the case for a few users this summer who installed the August Windows 11 24H2 update, only to find that their SSD had abruptly vanished from the PC. Initially, Microsoft said it found no link between the update and disappearing SSDs. Memory component provider Phison also said it failed to reproduce the bug. It took a DIY PC building group in Taiwan to discover that the affected SSDs “had been shipped with engineering firmware, not the finalized version.” The unforced error unlocked new fears about broken updates wiping out personal information, files, photos, and more. As always, back up your most important information as often as you can.—James Peckham Almost every major streaming service hiked its prices in 2025, making it far more expensive to have a hobby where you watch, listen, or play over the internet. Netflix kicked things off in late January, pushing prices with some subscriptions up by $2.50 per month. The price of Apple TV+, Disney+, Hulu, Max, Peacock, Spotify, and more have also risen, with some jumping up by $3 extra per month. In early 2026, Paramount+ is also set to join the list. And don’t even get us started on the 50% hike for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. Many savvy subscribers are now simply cancelling services and rotating from month to month depending on what they want to watch. The promise of cutting the cable cord and saving money by streaming is fading fast. —James Peckham is obsessed with culture and tech, offering smart, spirited coverage of the products and innovations that shape our connected lives and the digital trends that keep us talking.

There were also reports of a game called Chemia being used install malware, but it’s unclear if any gamers were ever able to download it. Most recently, a game called BlockBlasters was used to steal over $150,000 in cryptocurrency. It’s unfortunate that you can’t escape these types of scams, even on the world’s most popular way to buy PC games.—James Peckham Gamers hoping to kick off summer 2026 recklessly around Vice City had their dreams smashed last month when Rockstar Games once again delayed the release of Grand Theft Auto VI, pushing it from May 2026 to Nov. 19, 2026. "We are sorry for adding additional time to what we realize has been a long wait, but these extra months will allow us to finish the game with the level of polish you have come to expect and deserve," Rockstar Games said. Last year, Rockstar's parent company, Take-Two Interactive, said GTA VI would release in the fall of 2025. In May 2025, it was delayed until May 2026.—Chloe Albanesius If ever there was a moment that felt like we were living through an episode of Veep, it was the "sharing war plans on Signal" episode that came to light in March. That was when Jeffery Goldberg, editor of The Atlantic, revealed that he'd accidentally been added to a group chat on Signal featuring most of President Trump's Cabinet. The group discussed a US military operation in Yemen, with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth sending what appeared to be pretty sensitive information via the messaging app. Hegseth, as well as CIA Director John Ratcliffe and DNI Tulsi Gabbard, later insisted that nothing was classified. However, a December report from the Pentagon's inspector general found that Hegseth put US troops at risk by using his personal phone to share information about the strikes.—Chloe Albanesius North Koreans have long been scamming their way into remote US jobs and funneling their salaries into government coffers. But the full scope of the threat became more apparent than ever in 2025 when federal investigators found that North Koreans had obtained jobs at more than 100 US companies, including many Fortune 500 firms. Cybersecurity vendor CrowdStrike also found that “over 320 companies in the last 12 months” had hired North Korean workers. To pull this off, North Koreans have been enlisting Americans to help them set up corporate-issued laptops from within the US in exchange for a kickback. In addition, the culprits use AI-powered deepfakes to fool recruiters during the job interview process. The resulting scheme generates millions for North Korea and helps the country pull off hacks since many remote IT jobs have access to sensitive internal systems. In response, more companies, including Coinbase, are requiring in-person onboarding for new hires to verify their identities.—Michael Kan Imagine updating your computer to the latest version of Windows 11 and finding it has totally wiped all of your storage. That was the case for a few users this summer who installed the August Windows 11 24H2 update, only to find that their SSD had abruptly vanished from the PC. Initially, Microsoft said it found no link between the update and disappearing SSDs. Memory component provider Phison also said it failed to reproduce the bug. It took a DIY PC building group in Taiwan to discover that the affected SSDs “had been shipped with engineering firmware, not the finalized version.” The unforced error unlocked new fears about broken updates wiping out personal information, files, photos, and more. As always, back up your most important information as often as you can.—James Peckham Almost every major streaming service hiked its prices in 2025, making it far more expensive to have a hobby where you watch, listen, or play over the internet. Netflix kicked things off in late January, pushing prices with some subscriptions up by $2.50 per month. The price of Apple TV+, Disney+, Hulu, Max, Peacock, Spotify, and more have also risen, with some jumping up by $3 extra per month. In early 2026, Paramount+ is also set to join the list. And don’t even get us started on the 50% hike for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. Many savvy subscribers are now simply cancelling services and rotating from month to month depending on what they want to watch. The promise of cutting the cable cord and saving money by streaming is fading fast. —James Peckham PCMag.com is a leading authority on technology, delivering lab-based, independent reviews of the latest products and services.

Title: America's affordability crisis is putting Aldi in the spotlight

news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Newlyweds Brittany Zwier and Frank Martinez are starting their life together looking for ways to save money. Zwier, 32, and Martinez, 40, have an annual income of more than $100,000 — but are finding their dollars aren’t stretching as far as they used to. The couple now buys groceries exclusively at the no-frills supermarket chain Aldi, where they say the prices are cheaper than at other stores. “We’re just buying what we need right now,” Zwier said outside an Aldi in New Jersey. They have stopped buying beef, which hit record-high prices this year as climate and import issues limited cattle supply. Zwier and Martinez are not alone. For millions of Americans, the cost of living has risen sharply in recent years, fueled by a mix of persistent inflation, high interest rates, soaring energy costs and consumer price increases due to tariffs. More than half of respondents in a recent NBC News poll said they have changed the groceries they buy in order to stay within their budgets. In the same survey, the cost of housing and the cost of food ranked as the top two economic problems respondents said their families were facing. This affordability crisis continues despite recent signs pointing to a resilient economy. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones stock indexes both closed at record highs on Christmas Eve. And newly released data showed that GDP grew 4.3% in the third quarter of the year, much more than economists had been expecting. The spoils of a booming stock market are not being distributed evenly. Economists say consumers are separating into two distinct tiers — what they’re calling a K-shaped economy. “The K-shape economy means that some Americans, usually the wealthiest Americans, are doing just fine,” said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union. “They’re in the top of the K. Their incomes are rising. Their spending is rising.” But many on the lower end of the “K” are finding their paychecks can’t keep up with rising costs of food, housing, utilities and child care. “They feel like they’re falling behind, or, if on a good day, maybe treading water,” Long said. To keep their expenses in check, Zwier and Martinez have cut back on eating out. “Maybe once every three months now, we’ll go out,” said Martinez. “Used to be at least date night here and there. But that’s something we’re now sacrificing because everything is just too expensive.” Zwier and Martinez are part of a broader pullback in restaurant spending — one that is taking a bite out of fast-casual spots like Chipotle, Cava and Sweetgreen. “A lot of the chain restaurants have had a hard time in this environment where people don’t want to pay $15 to $20 for a burrito or a salad,” said Long. The K-shaped shift has also drawn the attention of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. “We’re seeing people tightening their belts, changing products that they buy, buying less,” Powell said at a recent press conference in Washington. And the price pinch many consumers are experiencing this year goes beyond food. Zwier and Martinez have seen their electric and gas bills skyrocket. “We’re using less, and it costs more,” Zwier said. Across the country, electricity costs have jumped 6.9% in the last year, more than twice the rate of inflation, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This winter, U.S. households could spend an average of $995 on home heating alone, an increase of $84 from 2024, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association. “These increases may not sound dramatic to higher-income households,” said Mark Wolfe, executive director of NEADA. “But for families already struggling, they are devastating.” Budget retailers and grocers like Costco, Walmart and Aldi are well positioned to benefit from shifting spending habits among higher- and middle-income consumers. “We’re seeing shoppers across all demographics and income levels turning to Aldi, because the simple truth is that no one wants to pay more for groceries than they have to,” an Aldi spokesperson said in a statement to NBC News. Aldi has seen explosive growth over the last decade. The grocer said it operated 1,230 U.S. stores in 2012. That number had nearly doubled to around 2,400 U.S. stores in 2023. And Aldi plans to expand further with 800 new stores nationwide by 2028. The discount supermarket chain has gained a reputation for low prices and a bare-bones approach. Coin-operated shopping carts, few name-brand products and items shelved in cardboard containers and crates are all part of the Aldi experience. The promise of low prices draws shoppers like Michael Torres, who said he has been coming to Aldi for the last couple years. Torres and his wife, who have a 1-month-old daughter, are finding ways to make ends meet on an income of less than $50,000 a year. “As much as you can save is important,” Torres said outside a New Jersey Aldi earlier this month. “You still want to make sure you have the fridge full, whatever you need on the table.” “There’s wants and there’s needs,” he added. “If you need something, you get it.” But for now, he said, some “wants” may have to wait. As many Americans pull back on spending, the U.S. economy has become increasingly dependent on high-income households. The top 10% of earners were responsible for a record 49.2% of total U.S. consumer spending in the second quarter of this year, according to Moody’s Analytics. Many businesses are seeing strong demand for their premium fare. Ford and General Motors recently reported soaring sales for their biggest and priciest SUVs. Some companies are also building out their higher-end offerings to draw in big spenders. This month, American Airlines debuted a splashy new plane with lie-flat seats and Bluetooth connectivity while budget carrier JetBlue just opened its first airport lounge. But economists warn that relying on a tiny slice of Americans to drive consumer spending could put the U.S. on shaky footing. Consumer spending makes up the lion’s share of the nation’s total economic activity. “Whether the economy goes into a recession in 2026 hinges almost entirely on the top 20%,” said Navy Federal Credit Union’s Long. “If they do well, the overall economy does well. If they don’t, then we’re looking at a recession.” In the meantime, she said, everyone else could face growing pressure. “Wage gains are going to keep getting smaller, and inflation, those basic costs, are going to keep ticking up,” Long said. “That’s a recipe for middle-class squeeze.” Kayla Steinberg is a producer at NBC News covering business and the economy. © 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Title: Kelley Blue Book Says These 5 SUVs Are Some Of The Best Cars You Can Buy

Sport utility vehicles, or SUVs, are vehicles that have the tough frame of a truck but provide enough interior room for multiple passengers and cargo. And they aren't just popular among retirees with grandchildren or people fond of bulk shopping trips to stock up on items at Costco. There were $528 billion worth of SUV transactions in 2024 across the globe, a figure that is expected to swell to just over $876 billion by 2032, per Stellar Market Research. And SUVs and trucks were the best selling vehicles of the first three quarters of 2025 in the United States, according to Car and Driver. As a byproduct of their popularity, SUVs come in so many forms and models of varying quality that it is enough to put a car shopper into a fetal position of indecision, especially if you don't want to end up with a popular yet unreliable SUV. Fortunately, there's Kelley Blue Book, which has been a valuable source for automobile buyers since 1926. In early 2025, Kelley Blue Book came out with its Best Buy awards, which included Hyundai Kona, Honda CR-V, Kia Telluride, Ford Expedition, and Kia EV9. To give you a complete picture, we've included analyses and reviews from other online car sources in the roundup below. Rated as the best subcompact SUV, the Hyundai Kona is described by Kelley Blue Book as a roomy, comfortable, fuel-efficient vehicle that can get about 31 miles for the gallon. With a starting price of about $25,900, Hyundai Kona can seat five people with just over 38 inches of leg room and can carry 25.5 cubic feet of cargo, or a maximum of 63.7 cubic feet when the second-row seats are folded down. The vehicle comes equipped with a 12.3-inch infotainment display and an optional all-wheel drive. Plus, the 2025 Kona is equipped with standard safety features such as collision warning with automatic emergency braking and blind-spot monitoring. Yet according to Edmunds, the 2025 Hyundai Kona's acceleration abilities are "underwhelming," while its suspension is not all that great, making it a less-than-ideal vehicle for off-roading (the model still got a 7.8 out of 10 rating). Consumer Reports, though, rated the 2025 Hyundai Kona overall reliability at 41 out of 100, about average for that model year. In terms of costs to fix and maintain, CarEdge estimated that a Hyundai Kona will cost $8,463 over its first ten years, which is $297 more than non-luxury SUVs. As for how quickly this car can depreciate, CarEdge says it will lose 42% of its value after five years. That's better than the 53% depreciation of a Wagoneer, a popular Jeep with terrible resale value. Kelley Blue Book compared the 2025 Honda CR-V — the winner of the best compact SUV category — to the brightest start in the sky for its quality, tech features, and the 76.5 cubic feet of cargo space it can provide once you fold down the rear seats. Though compact, the CR-V provides 41 inches of legroom for its rear seats along with reclining backs. And its hybrid versions can give up to 40 miles per gallon. But where the CR-V truly excels is in its resale value, which Kelley Blue Book reports can fetch thousands of dollars more than its competitors due to the Honda brand's reputation for reliability. CarEdge agreed, putting its depreciation at just 29% over its first five years. With a starting price of $31,495, the Honda CR-V costs $7,696 to fix and maintain in its first ten years of service, which is $530 less than the average for other popular SUV models. Also: Car and Driver called the 2025 model year a solid vehicle that's high in demand, and Edmunds gave it a 7.1 out of 10. However, this model was part of a recall ordered on Honda vehicles by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) for potential fuel leaks and possibly incorrectly manufactured bad steering gearboxes. The winner of the best midsize SUV for the sixth year in a row, the 2025 Kia Telluride has a three-row configuration that can seat eight, a Mercedez-Benz-quality dual-display infotainment touchscreen, 21 cubic feet of cargo space behind the third row, and a total of 87 cubic feet with the two rear rows folded down, according to Kelley Blue Book. The model, which starts at about $37,800, also comes with automatic emergency braking, blind-spot monitoring, and a host of other safety features. In terms of reliability, Consumer Reports gives it an average with a score of 60 out of 100, although the vehicle also scored 72 out of 100 for owner satisfaction. Edmunds gives it a 7.1 out of 10 rating, while Car and Driver stated that Kia Telluride's standard features approach luxury standards. As for its resale value, the Kia Telluride will depreciate 51% in its first five years, according to CarEdge, and will cost $8,730 to maintain and fix in its first 10 years, which is $564 more than typical SUVs. The '25 Ford Expedition took Kelley Blue Book's best full-size SUV award for its three-row spacious interior with plentiful cupholders and USB-C ports, ability to tow trailers up to 9,600 pounds, and a variety of trims, like the Expedition Tremor, that are great for transverse unpaved trails. With a starting price of $64,515, it has a mobile Wi-Fi hotspot that allows people to stream music and audiobooks as well as videos when parked. There is even a Bluetooth controller for people to play online games. The second row has tablet holders on the back of the front seat headrests, and there is a 13.2-inch infotainment touchscreen for navigation and climate control. The vehicle also comes with a safety package that includes a 360-degree camera, emergency braking, adaptive cruise control, and blind-spot and lane-keeping assist functions. On the downside, according to Consumer Reports, the 2025 Ford Expedition is less reliable than the average car, with a reliability rating of 30 out of 100. It also costs $10,226 to maintain a Ford Expedition model in its first ten years of ownership, which is $2,060 more than other popular SUV models, per CarEdge. Ford Expeditions also depreciate 59% in five years, with a ranking of 164 out of 185 models analyzed by CarEdge for resale value. Large enough to seat seven people, the Kia EV9 won Kelley Blue Book's Best Buy spot for 3-row EVs. An electric midsized SUV with prices that start at $56,395, the Kia EV9 can seat seven people comfortably, has a maximum range of 304 miles, and can get 150 miles worth of range after charging for only 15 minutes. Edmunds gave the model 8.2 out of 10, but Consumer Reports deemed the 2025 Kia EV9 less reliable than other cars of the same model year. There were also three recalls ordered by NHTSA because of a badly welded gear shift that causes the vehicle to lose power (342 vehicles for year 2025); possible missing bolts in the second and third row seats (22,883 vehicles for years 2024 and 2025); and a failing instrument panel screen for speed and other info (14,163 vehicles for years 2024 and 2025). But if those issues are addressed by dealerships free of charge, as expected, the Kia EV9 is projected to cost $5,237 to maintain and fix in its first 10 years, which is $2,929 better than the average SUV, per CarEdge. However, in five years it will lose 52% of its value.

Title: Christmas Wrap: Retailers Relieved After Achieving Middling Gains

Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily Apparel performed especially strongly this holiday and there's some optimism that 2026 might be OK for the retail business. Senior Editor, Retail Between price hikes due to tariffs and inflation, sagging consumer confidence, and shoppers becoming choosier than ever, retailers had plenty to overcome this holiday season. But they managed to — and should emerge with sales 3 to 4 percent above last year’s holiday season, meeting or slightly surpassed their plans, according to commentary from about two dozen retailers, shopping center executives, analysts, and market researchers. How did they do it? Retailers offered values that were appealing and apparent. Consumers were willing to absorb tariff-related price increases, generally under 10 percent on fashion. And the weather was conducive to Americans getting out to shop, except where there was flooding in the Pacific Northwest and storms in the Midwest. California was battered with flooding rains on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, and the Northeast got hit with a major snowstorm late Friday into Saturday. These likely reduced store visits for returns and shopping with gift cards and had some impact on business, but probably didn’t dramatically alter the outcome. Related Articles Fashion A New Batch of Luxury Bestsellers Has Landed at Nordstrom's End-of-Year Sale -- Shop Brands Like Ferragamo, McQueen, and More Shop Shoes DSW's Biggest Sale of the Year Is Here and It's Good-- Save Over 60% on Top Styles From Ugg, Crocs, Nike, Michael Kors Throughout the season there was no letup in spending by the nation’s wealthiest, with by some statistics the top 10 income percentile accounting for 50 percent of spending. Income levels have been rising, but the unemployment rate is also increasing, reaching 4.6 percent as of November. You May Also Like Apparel has sold surprising well. Bestselling categories and looks were outerwear, cold-weather accessories, Fair Isle sweaters, fragrance, fur, faux fur, sleepwear including matching parent and kids sets, athleisure, and athletic footwear. Electronics also fared well, particularly video games. On the other hand, sales of home goods were on the soft side. Visa projected holiday spending (Nov. 1 to Dec. 31) in the U.S. will be up 4.2 percent year-over-year, led by sales of electronics. Mastercard forecasts a 3.9 percent year-over-year gain, with apparel the top category, generating a 7.8 percent sales increase. Those estimates fall in line with the National Retail Federation’s prediction of 3.7 to 4.2 percent holiday sales gains, and total U.S. holiday sales eclipsing $1 trillion for the first time. A clearer picture of how the 2025 season played out with sales and profits will emerge when retailers issue their fourth-quarter results in February and March. “This was a decent season, not great, but a good one,” said Jim von Maur, president and fourth-generation leader of the Davenport, Iowa-based Von Maur Department Stores. “In the Midwest we had horrific storms almost every weekend, but we’ve been catching up, and we’ll end the season in the 3 percent range. Men’s has been really strong. Cosmetics not as much. Fragrance has been good. Children’s has been very good.” Among the bestselling brands cited by von Maur were Skims, Uggs, Peter Millar, Vineyard Vines, Spanx, Hoka, and Cloud 9. “I think we are going to have strong business right after Christmas,” von Maur added. “People will continue to shop. I’m optimistic about that, but you never know about returns. People will be out shopping for deals. Our competitors seem to be promotional. We were restrained. We sold a lot at full-price and did not see [consumer] resistance to that.” “The Christmas selling season has been better than we anticipated,” said Stephen Yalof, president and chief executive officer of Tanger. “On Super Saturday, we saw sales levels in stores that rivaled Black Friday; in some cases there were even steeper levels. We saw stores taking half off everything, stacking discounts on top of discounts, giving gifts with purchase, even some door busters, but the promotions were planned for sure. I don’t think there was any desperation.” Regarding post-Christmas returns and shopping, Tanger was probably less impacted by the inclement weather since most of its 38 outlet centers and three open-air lifestyle centers are in warmer climates. Yalof listed Nike, Under Armour and Adidas in athletic apparel and footwear; Michael Kors, Coach and Tory Burch in accessories; Pandora and Kay in jewelry, and Gap and Old Navy in apparel as among the busiest destinations. “The season was good early on and good late and the lull in the middle lasted a little longer than we expected, so the shopping got bigger very late,” said one top retail executive, who said the season has been OK. Regarding the snow and rains post Christmas, “I don’t think that should change things dramatically.” One specialty retail executive at a company that also wholesales said, “We feel really fortunate. There could have been this perfect storm between tariffs, the price of gold going up at least 50 percent to $4,500, and the situation with Saks Global,” which hasn’t been paying vendors and seems headed for bankruptcy. Nevertheless, the source said, “Gold has been selling very strong.” Following an “amazing Black Friday,” business continued to churn throughout the holiday season at Brooks Brothers, according to CEO Ken Ohashi. “We’ll end the month in a good place,” he said. “We had a tremendous sportswear year,” he said, led by sweaters, knitwear and fashion items in seasonal colors and patterns. “A lot of our business is replenishment items, like our white button-down shirts and Golden Fleece blazers, but the disproportionate strength of our fashion offering tells me the customer is looking for newness,” he said. Ohashi said Brooks Brothers notched a strong number of new customers this year purchasing at full price. “Our consumer is pretty resilient and our dollars per transaction have been up all year,” he said.Bob Mitchell, CEO of Mitchells Stores, said the company’s 10 stores had “another record holiday season. To keep putting increases on every year is great. The formula is working — clients are just happy to be in a multibrand environment with high service.” Although Mitchells and Richards on the East Coast led the way, Wilkes Bashford stores in California, including the unit in Palo Alto that was up against a strong opening last year, also performed well. Marios stores in Seattle and Portland, Ore., “came on strong at the end,” Mitchell said, and the latest addition, Stanley Korshak in Dallas, also had a good season. For most of the company, traffic slowed at the end, Mitchell said, particularly in menswear, but overall, the business posted high-single-digit gains for the season. In men’s, top performers included luxury sweaters, outerwear and expensive casual pants from Marco Pescarolo. Zegna was the most popular brand along with Kiton, Brunello Cucinelli and Loro Piana. In women’s, “jewelry was the big winner,” along with expensive outerwear that “helped make up for the lighter traffic,” Mitchell said.“It was busy the last few days before Christmas, which caught me a little by surprise,” said Ken Giddon, president of Rothmans, which operates men’s stores in New York City and the nearby Westchester County. “I’m surprised at the tenacity of the consumer. There was a crazy amount of gift giving. Our suburban stores were a little light on merchandise because of the big late push. I guess we did a good job picking the right things.” Giddon said the strongest sellers included Eleventy and Peter Millar, a brand that ran out of stock early, and an indicator of the strength of the quarter-zip sweater trend. “We’re selling those to the younger guys as well as their dads.” Raffi sweaters, Barbour socks and Brax pants were also strong sellers. “As the weather changes, we get a big push in outerwear and we also benefit from kids coming home from college and shopping for suits,” Giddon said. Heather Kaminetsky, CEO of Net-a-porter, said in a statement, “This holiday season we’ve seen our customer buy gifts for others, but also for herself — with peaks in fine jewelry from David Morris and Jessica McCormack, cozy fashion pieces from Loewe and Khaite and accessories from The Row.” One retail CEO, who requested anonymity, said, “A lot of [retailers] have taken their units down and are riding on higher average unit retail prices. There’s less inventory out there. I think after last April, a lot of people scrambled to pull down some things because the cost of inventory went up, and so you really had to pick your shots. We took our assortment down. It was effective for us. It’s paying off in margin, in a year where margin has been hit hard with the increased cost of tariffs.” Asked if markdowns were steeper this year compared to 2024, the retailer said, “I don’t think the magnitude increased any. Q4 is the most promotional quarter. We all know that. But it’s also, for many of us, the lowest margin quarter, right? It’s a lot of volume, but it’s also end of year, end of season, and given the inflated cost basis, we’ve all been very careful about managing our inventory so it doesn’t dilute our margins too much. No one wants the inventory after the holiday.” “I’m hearing from retailers that Black Friday and Super Saturday were both good,” said John Neutzling, chief operating officer of Miller Capital Advisors. “They both showed increases over last year. However, what was more interesting is that the sales across the weeks of Black Friday and Super Saturday were better than last year also. So that suggests shoppers were showing up all week long.” The privately held Skokie, Ill.-based Miller Capital has 17 properties in its portfolio including large, high-profile shopping centers like Ala Moana in Honolulu, Scottsdale Fashion Square in Arizona and the Houston Galleria. “Some of the legacy brands, the ones that have been around for a while, seem to now appeal to Gen Z and even Gen Alpha. The Gap in particular has found a really good business plan, and has had multiple quarters of sales growth,” said Neutzling. John Harmon, a technology and equity analyst at Coresight, characterized the season as “just on track,” but could wind up being a bit better than 3 to 3.5 percent. Noting how people were shopping early, Harmon said October seemed “pretty calm, business really picked up in November, and 34.7 percent of consumers in the U.S. were done shopping by Dec. 15.” Regarding promotions, “It seemed pretty normal and largely planned.” Harmon listed Amazon, Walmart and Target as the top-performing retailers during the season, though Walmart was largely fueled by its superior food offering; Amazon by its popularity, speedy deliveries and low prices, and Target apparently experienced a pickup after several sluggish seasons. He also cited Dollar Tree, TJ Maxx, Dollar General, Costco and Kohl’s as having a good season. With holiday shopping spreading out over a longer period, Black Friday was less busy this year, with 46.8 percent of consumers shopping, versus 63.8 percent last year. Doorbusters were limited, and the Black Friday crowds of yesteryear were gone. “The season ended on a high note,” said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners. “Super Saturday and the Sunday and Monday after were very strong days for retailers, in terms of foot traffic and buying. It’s also been an excellent year for apparel, which is well over 7 percent ahead. Apparel was a laggard for many years. But people have been out spending, perceptions of the economy are improving, and interest rates ticked down. The impact of tariffs has been overblown. We think that will all settle out. “The real thing that added money for spending was this dramatic drop in gasoline prices. We went into the season forecasting 4 to 4.6 percent sales growth. It might get up to 5 percent-plus” overall for the retail sector. Johnson, like other observers, cited Walmart, Costco, Amazon and off-price players as performing well this season. “It’s been a relatively benign promotional season, though there are always a few outliers, most retailers were 25 to 40 percent off, though Gap offered 40 percent off everything” in late December, he said. Industrywide, “Inventories were pretty much in balance, as the two months unfolded we saw people really beginning to spend.” The athleisure sector, including Vuori, Beyond Yoga and Free People Movement, were exceptionally strong, and retailers specializing in health and personal care had a good season. Demand for consumer electronics picked up, but mostly with video games. Outdoor sporting goods had just “a pretty good season.” Returns were in full swing starting Friday, as were post-Christmas sales, so Americans took the opportunity to exchange gifts for credit or take advantage of discounted merchandise. The combination of returning gifts and taking advantage of deepening discounts will continue for weeks, as will redeeming gift cards. For the holiday season, about 20 percent of apparel sold will be returned, according to Marcus Shen, CEO of B-stock, a business-to-business platform helping retailers unload returns and excess merchandise to off-pricers, jobbers and resale stores. The vast majority of apparel, he believes, will be back on the shelves and hangers. “Consumer electronics and some other categories outside of apparel are probably closer to the 10 to 15 percent range. It varies by brand and category.” Overall, he expects return rates to be a slightly above last year’s, mirroring how sales perform. While business has been so far so good, the Friday and weekend after Christmas brought significant weather volatility, impacting what’s normally a busy day in stores for returns and redeeming gift cards. In the Pacific Northwest, “Heavy precipitation and high winds are expected to persist through New Year’s Day,” Evan Gold, executive vice president of global partnership and alliances at Planalytics, which quantifies how weather impacts businesses, wrote in a report. “Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, Sacramento, Seattle and Portland are among the major markets to expect heavy precipitation, including 3-plus inches of rain over the coming days. This will bring flooding conditions and keep soils saturated. In addition, high winds are expected from Northern California into the Pacific Northwest, posing threats for power outages and causing travel disruptions.” Gold indicated that sales on the West Coast of need-based categories will spike, including wiper blades, rainwear and pumps. Major population centers, including New York City, Philadelphia, Boston, Baltimore and Detroit, got hit with snow and ice over the weekend. New York City got over 4 inches of snow, its most in four years. Another storm, mainly rain with some ice, was expected to hit the Northeast late Sunday afternoon into early Monday morning. Gold wrote before the Saturday storm that it was likely to drive demand for need-based categories, including ice melt, snow shovels, scrapers, heaters and more, Gold wrote. However, unlike the days preceding Christmas, when consumers must get to the stores for last-minute gifts, shoppers could wait out the bad post-Christmas weather hitting the East Coast and California because stores typically allow 30 to 90 days to make returns and gift cards are generally good for years. Looking ahead to 2026, there will be a wave of tax refunds due to U.S. President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” and he has proposed providing a onetime, $2,000 tariff rebate to Americans to offset some of the impact of tariffs and the anxiety over the economy to stimulate spending. Also, Trump has proposed $1,176 “warrior dividends” to military personnel. “From what we understand from the customer, there is enthusiasm” about the economic stimulus from the government, Yalof observed. “There is a lot money in the marketplace.” Yalof also said retailers he’s had contact with are “very optimistic” about 2026. “Retailers have not slowed down growth, from a leasing perspective. We’re doing a lot of brick-and-mortar deals.” Ohashi at Brooks Brothers said he believes the skies will be bright “as long as we continue to offer newness.” While half of the company’s stores are in the Northeast, he said Brooks will be focusing more on its warm-weather doors next year, even opening two stores in Puerto Rico in 2026. Stores in warmer climates move into spring more quickly, providing a quicker read on the season. Mitchell said he’s “a little cautious, especially in men’s where traffic slowed the last two weeks, but I’m still positive.” Giddon at Rothmans said he’s optimistic about 2026, and that the final days before Christmas “surprised us because we felt the economy wasn’t that strong. But people are obviously more optimistic so we’ll have to measure our projections slightly upward for 2026.” RetailNext tracks shopper traffic at hundreds of retailers outfitted with tens of thousands of RetailNext traffic counters. “For the season overall, traffic was down 6.5 percent from November through Super Saturday,” said Joe Shasteen, global manager, advanced analytics, Retail Next. Stores were getting fewer visits, but conversion rates held up. “The shopping this year was more intentional and less about browsing,” Shasteen said, adding that retailers made up shortfalls in their stores with their e-commerce businesses, which were up in the high single digits. “Holiday sales are not a reliable predictor, but we see a 5 percent-plus gain possibly repeated in the first quarter of 2026. It may even jump ahead of that, if we see a turn in the housing market,” said Johnson. “There are a couple of signs of that happening, but it’s not quite there yet. Housing has historically been a big booster to growth. If interest rates come down, we may yet see not just above 5, but 6 percent by the back half.” “All the indicators show we are going to have some positive business going into 2026,” Von Maur said. “The economy is still strong, unemployment is low, tariffs got the prices up but customers aren’t holding back.” With tariffs, “The worst is behind us.” “The holiday season has so far been a success for retailers,” Stephanie Cegielski, vice president, research and public relations, ICSC, said on Tuesday. “Consumers are still price-sensitive, but most continued to shop in the final days leading up to Christmas….One thing is clear: Despite their economic concerns, consumers are still willing to spend on memorable experiences, entertainment and gifts at the right price. They may be prioritizing value, but the retailers that are winning this holiday season will look beyond price to connect with consumers and stay on their radars into 2026 and beyond.” — With contributions from Jean E.
