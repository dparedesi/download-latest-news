Plus: DeepSeek’s Debut Chills Markets, Trump Remakes IRS And Tax Policy In His Image, DEI Wins And Loses, Boeing’s Bad 2024 Continues A Trend Of Losses Monday was one of the worst days the Nasdaq has seen in two years, thanks to a massive tech selloff. Chinese AI model DeepSeek, an apparently self-funded platform that reportedly cost just $5.6 million to train, and which was likely developed with less powerful chips than those behind U.S.-based models from companies including OpenAI, made many U.S. tech investors pause and pull back. DeepSeek, which outperformed some OpenAI models, showed the U.S. that a Chinese tech company could become a frontrunner in the race to develop generative AI platforms, despite extensive restrictions placed on U.S. tech exports by former president Joe Biden to prevent that. Investor and billionaire Marc Andreessen wrote on X that DeepSeek’s model is “AI’s Sputnik moment,” Forbes’ Rashi Shrivastava and Richard Nieva wrote. DeepSeek pulled the tech-heavy Nasdaq down more than 3% on Monday, but individual companies saw much deeper losses. Nvidia, which makes the processors that power the U.S.’s AI revolution, saw its stock fall nearly 17% on Monday, setting records by shedding nearly $589 billion in the company’s market value. In a statement, Nvidia called DeepSeek’s model an “excellent AI advancement” that actually does use “significant numbers” of Nvidia’s GPUs, but they’re less powerful ones made for use in China that are “fully export control compliant.” Nvidia wasn’t the only company to see a big loss on Monday driven by DeepSeek. Chipmakers Broadcom saw a 17% one-day drop, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, whose stock fell 13%, were also hurt by the news. The markets slowly began recovering Tuesday, but increases were more gradual. There’s long been speculation that AI companies were becoming overvalued. Nvidia rocketed from a company that made graphics cards for video games to the leading player in AI hardware—and now with eyes on self-driving cars, robotics and smart warehouses—in a matter of years, and has at times been the world’s most valuable company. While Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet, Meta and Apple have several other services, company progress on AI has played an outsized role as in how their shares have performed. And private companies including OpenAI—valued at $157 billion—and Anthropic—worth $6 billion after a pending $2 billion funding round is finalized—are pulling in dollars and influence. According to Crunchbase, close to a third of all global venture funding in 2024 went to companies in AI-related fields, totaling more than $100 billion. Is this the beginning of the burst of the AI bubble? It could be. Before DeepSeek impacted U.S. markets, Forbes contributor Abdo Riani compared AI to the tech bubble a generation ago, when early dot-com companies quickly went from ballooning fortunes to struggling to keep the lights on. The dot-com bubble was fueled by investor over-optimism in the power of the internet, overlooking rational considerations of what the technology could do and deliver. The companies that survived the bubble’s burst, including Amazon, Google and eBay, Riani wrote, used the technology to bring specific values and usage to the technology. The stock market leader of two years from now may be a company that can use AI to make a difference through AI-powered agents, or mostly autonomous robots and vehicles. But maybe it will still be Nvidia, which will continue creating the hardware for AI, and has a good track record of recovering from drastic swings in its value. The CFO’s role in a company is always evolving. I talked to Megan Weis, vice president and general manager of finance & accounting outsourcing services at finance talent company Personiv, and host of a weekly CFO podcast, about the changes she’s seeing in the job. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. President Donald Trump speaks at a White House news conference last week. Taxes are important to Donald Trump, and he’s pressing forward with remaking the IRS in his policy likeness. Former IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel officially left the department on January 20, writes Forbes’ Kelly Phillips Erb, clearing a path for Trump nominee Billy Long to take over. IRS commissioners serve five-year terms and are generally not replaced as administrations change. Werfel’s term wasn’t up until late 2027. No confirmation hearings appear to be scheduled for Long, a former congressman and Trump loyalist with no direct background in tax policy. Among his day one executive orders, Trump put a 90-day federal hiring freeze in place throughout the government so the new Department of Government Efficiency could figure out the correct size of the government workforce. However, the IRS hiring freeze seems more permanent, and will remain in place until the Treasury secretary determines it’s in the national interest to lift it, Phillips Erb writes. Biden boosted the IRS’s personnel funding in order to provide better and faster service to taxpayers, as well as to pursue high-wealth individuals, large corporations and complex partnerships to ensure they are paying their fair share. In November and December 2023, the IRS offered positions to more than 560 new accountants. This week, Phillips Erb writes, job offers have been rescinded to job candidates with start dates after February 8. Trump has also talked about firing existing IRS employees, aiming at the 87,000 new IRS workers—for positions ranging from customer service and IT to enforcement—that would be hired over the next decade through 2023’s Inflation Reduction Act. “They hired, or tried to hire, 88,000 workers to go after you and we're in the process of developing a plan to either terminate all of them, or maybe we'll move them to the border,” he told a crowd last week at the Circa Resort & Casino in Las Vegas, Phillips Erb reported. While Trump passed large tax cuts in his first term and has said extending—or even increasing—them is a priority in his second, Republicans in Congress are hashing out the best way to do that. Trump has said he wants everything in one bill so it’s easier to get everything that is wanted. The Senate confirmed Scott Bessent as Treasury secretary on Monday, so the leadership to enact those cuts is now in place. As far as international taxes, Trump also issued a memo saying that any commitment made under the Biden administration to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development with respect to the Global Tax Deal will not be followed. The OECD determines how international corporations are taxed by all countries, and Trump’s memo says that Congress will work toward a more America first tax policy, Phillips Erb writes. A Costco store in Richmond, California. As some companies rein in their diversity, equity and inclusion efforts—last week, Target joined the list of companies scaling back policies to increase hiring and promotions of people of color and women—others are doubling down on them. Costco’s shareholders almost unanimously bucked a challenge to its diversity policies, writes Forbes senior contributor Pamela Danziger. The National Center for Public Policy Research had petitioned the retailer to audit the company’s “litigation, reputational and financial risks” caused by its DEI policies. Costco’s leadership rejected the proposal last month and urged shareholders to vote it down, saying that the retailer regularly evaluates its policies. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon also stood firm in his commitment to DEI initiatives, saying, “Bring them on” in an interview with CNBC last week, Forbes senior contributor Jack Kelly writes. However, business DEI policies may be thrust in an uncomfortable spotlight by Trump, who opposes the policy. He signed a day one executive order ending federal DEI programs, saying that the “illegal and immoral” plans “demonstrated immense public waste and shameful discrimination.” Another executive order brings this crackdown to the private sector by rescinding a 1965 anti-discrimination order for federal contractors from President Lyndon B. Johnson. Trump is now requiring agencies to identify contractors who use “coded or imprecise language” to “obscure” DEI initiatives, as well as identifying up to nine potential civil compliance investigations of private sector entities “to deter DEI programs or principles…that constitute illegal discrimination or preferences.” The attorney general will take this information and issue a report of recommendations to take action within 120 days.

With a shocking in-flight plane malfunction, a rejected plea deal for two fatal crashes in 2018 and 2019, and a seven-week machinists strike halting production, Boeing had a terrible 2024—posting a stunning $11.8 billion loss. But, Forbes’ Jeremy Bogaisky writes, that’s actually part of a pattern for Boeing. The aircraft company is on a six-year losing streak, and is likely to have lost a total of $35.7 billion in that time period. Forbes senior contributor Jim Osman writes that activist investors—including investment titan Warren Buffett—may be looking closely at Boeing as a potential target. Personiv Vice President and General Manager of Finance & Accounting Outsourcing Services Megan Weis. As vice president and general manager of finance & accounting outsourcing services at finance talent company Personiv, Megan Weis has her finger on the pulse of how the CFO’s profession is changing. She also talks with different CFOs about their work in her CFO Weekly podcast. I talked to her about the CFO’s evolution in 2025. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. How do you see the CFO’s role continuing to evolve in 2025? Weis: I can’t have a conversation these days without hearing about generative AI. It’s still pretty nascent. Most smaller to mid-size companies are experimenting with some things here and there at the moment, whereas enterprise companies are using it to turn data into actionable insights. Technology is going to continue to evolve. Cybersecurity is becoming a huge issue these days, and CFOs are becoming more and more responsible for managing that risk. Hackers are becoming more clever, and the risks are just becoming more and more. Globally, it’s becoming very unstable. We have supply chain issues, there are currency fluctuations, inflationary concerns. It’s becoming more complex. Soft skills are becoming and more and more of a requirement. The CFO role is like a ringleader; it’s very collaborative. The CFO is becoming more responsible for communicating across the organization, and that ties back to the idea of being the storyteller. With so much data out there, it’s becoming increasingly necessary to digest that data, turn it into actionable insights, and be able to communicate it back to the organization in a way that finance or non-finance and accounting people can understand, whether that be employees or investors. How did the evolution to CFO-as-storyteller begin, and what stories can the CFO tell that a company would miss otherwise? It started when the CFO role started gearing toward being more of a strategic role, or a right hand to the CEO. The CFO is becoming more responsible for bridging the gap between finance and other departments. They’re responsible for collaborating. A lot of them throughout their career are stepping out of finance for a time and concentrating more in operational areas. [It’s important] being able to communicate to investors [and] employees, and really humanizing financial data. At this point, there’s just so much data that's available to finance and accounting and the CFO that you really have to take that data, boil it down, digest it, tell a story with it, and then align that story with the culture and the objectives of the organization. In general, the world is looking for more transparency. They’re looking for organizations who stand for something, and that’s part of where the storytelling comes in. People want to work for organizations that are purpose-driven and where the stories align, whether that be the stories they’re trying to sell to investors or the story that their financial data is telling. Transparency is becoming more and more critical. Historically, CFOs have been more of a news reporter. They’ve taken historical data and regurgitated it back to investors and companies, whereas today, they’re more forward-looking, more strategic. They still have to get the numbers, but they’re helping to shape the story more than just report the news. How do fractional CFOs work, and how often are they being used? Fractional CFOs are something that I hadn’t really heard about before I’d started this podcast. I do think that they are becoming more prevalent. They’ve grown over the last decade or so, and they’re being used a lot for small and mid-size businesses who can’t afford a full-time CFO, but still need the guidance of someone with experience being a CFO. The fractional CFO plays really well into the gig economy: People wanting a portfolio of work, and maybe not just relying on one employee to be their employee for their entire career. That’s not the way things work anymore. An employe[r] might not hold on to you for your entire career. Building a portfolio of clients for CFOs is the route that they want to go. Also, with more PE-backed companies, those PE firms are looking for CFOs, and someone with the experience of a CFO to help make strategic decisions for those organizations, help guide them through growth periods. I also think fractional CFOs play a big part in a company being able to be agile and pull in experts when those experts are needed. Every company goes through different stages, whether that be growth or crisis, and I think the fractional CFO allows those small companies to be agile and pull in the right talent when it’s needed. Unionized employees at Costco voted to go on strike when their contract expires on January 31.

Title: U.S. Retail Sales Projected to Increase by 4% in 2025, Reaching $5.2 Trillion Amid Economic Challenges

Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily Bain & Co. report details strategic resolutions for retailers, while also highlighting growth in non-store sales. Executive Editor According to a research report from the retail team at Bain & Co., nominal U.S. retail sales are pegged to see a 4 percent increase, year-over-year, in 2025 — “barring major macroeconomic or geopolitical shocks,” the firm noted. The report also included “resolutions” that successful retailers are focusing on this year. “That equates to around $5.2 trillion in estimated total sales in 2025,” the authors of the report said. “It’s a strong outlook, given a stagnant consumer outlook, tempering inflation, negative [year-over-year] employment trends, diminishing consumer savings, rising credit card delinquencies, elevated nondiscretionary costs and potential trade disruptions.” Related Articles Technology Retail C-Suite to Boost AI Investment Amid Growing Adoption, Workforce Readiness Concerns Interior Design EXCLUSIVE: Interior Designer Nina Magon on Becoming a Global Brand The Bain advisers said they expect growth will be fueled by a 10 percent increase in non-store sales, “while in-store sales will see modest 2 percent gains, led by general merchandise, apparel, and health and personal care stores.” You May Also Like The report was written and compiled by Bain partners Aaron Cheris, Kurt Grichel, Marc-André Kamel and Darrell Rigby as well as Stephanie Koszyk, practice director. “Retailers face a pivotal moment in 2025,” the report’s authors said. “The challenges of shifting consumer behaviors and demands, economic volatility, regulatory changes and trade complexities persist, reshaping the retail game. Successful businesses will go beyond the familiar, tapping into cutting-edge technologies, reimagining loyalty programs and fortifying supply chains against an unpredictable global backdrop.” The report said that while headwinds remain, “opportunities such as potential interest rate cuts, tax incentives and momentum from a strong 2024 holiday season suggest 2025 may be a year in which innovative moves can set the stage for lasting success.” Regarding resolutions for success, the Bain report said companies should take cues from “scale players” such as Walmart and Amazon (with large assortments, along with Costco). The report’s authors said these brands “have become the go-to for many shoppers, accounting for 57 percent of retail growth over the last three quarters and 17 percent of total U.S. retail sales in 2024 — a 6-percentage-point increase from 2014.” The firm said competing directly with these giants is harder than ever. “But by crafting a unique value proposition, retailers can carve out a winning position alongside them and capture significant rewards.” Bain said a clear and compelling value proposition starts “with the fundamentals, be it fast shipping, consistent quality or reliable digital experiences. Miss here, and irrelevance is almost inevitable.” The fundamentals include having balanced assortments that cater to customer preferences, which can boost sales by 2 to 5 percent. “Private brands are becoming an especially powerful tool, adding value through exclusivity,” Bain said noting that the firm’s research shows high-performing private brands can boost grocer share of wallet by 12 percentage points. Pricing and promotions will also be a key to success. “Strong value perception doesn’t always mean chasing the lowest price,” the report stated. “Retailers with a competitive advantage build structured pricing architectures that align with their customer and product strategies, balancing margin growth and market share. Personalized promotions tailored to individual preferences can further enhance value perception and influence buying behavior — ultimately improving ROI.” With the supply chain, Bain recommends diversifying supplier sourcing, which involves retailers adopting “right-shoring strategies” to optimize operations balancing cost, resilience and speed. The firm said the focus is not on shifting entirely to one region, but creating a flexible system capable of addressing priorities such as response times, market proximity, or resource access during volatility. Bain said its research showed that about 70 percent of retailers said they intend to augment onshoring or nearshoring in the next three years, with many U.S. companies lessening dependence on China in favor of regions such as India or North America. For example, Steve Madden plans to cut imports from China by 40 percent to 45 percent next year by establishing alternative production and sourcing in different countries. The footwear brand was one of the first to act in response to an announcement of possible tariffs on China from the administration of President Donald Trump.The report’s authors said optimizing networks with “digital twins” can also mitigate sourcing challenges. Digital twin platforms are virtual models that use real-time data to test the impact of different variables. Retailers are adopting these platforms to simulate disruptive scenarios such as weather or labor shortages, allowing for quick network adjustments and long-term strategic planning. Integrated with real-time tracking for comprehensive visibility, digital twins help pinpoint vulnerabilities, enhance processes and strengthen supply chains.In addition, predictive analytics are increasingly used for smarter inventory management, enabling retailers to anticipate demand shifts and optimize stock levels effectively. “Amid fast-changing consumer preferences and frequent disruptions, precise forecasting is crucial,” the report’s authors said. “AI-powered tools can help analyze demand in real-time, allowing retailers to dynamically adjust inventory placement to reduce transit times, lower costs and prevent costly stockouts or excess inventory. Bain’s experience shows custom AI forecasting models can cut excess inventory by 40 percent and boost accuracy by nearly 50 percent compared to manual planning.” Sign up for WWD news straight to your inbox every day Get all the top news stories and alerts straight to your inbox.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Fundamental Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) stands against other best fundamental stocks to buy now. The S&P 500 index closed 0.3% lower at 6,101.24 on Friday, January 24, reversing its course after hitting a fresh intraday record earlier in the session. The Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average also slipped, with the former dropping 0.5% to 19,954.30 and the latter falling 140.82 points to 44,424.25. This marked the end of a four-day winning streak for the three major indexes. The decline was largely attributed to investors taking profits, particularly in mega-cap tech stocks. Despite this, the market remains bullish, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq posting their second consecutive positive week, rising 1.7% and 1.7% respectively. The Dow climbed 2.2% over the same period. In other news, President Trump made headlines on Thursday by calling for interest rates to drop immediately and asking Saudi Arabia and other OPEC nations to lower the price of oil. Market participants are closely watching the President’s statements, which have had a significant impact on the market. However, the market’s optimism is largely driven by President Donald Trump’s pro-business policies, which have boosted risk assets. Investors are also relieved that the President has only made threats on the tariff front, rather than taking formal action, during his first few days in office.

In an interview with CNBC on January 23, Mike Bailey, Director of Research at FBB Capital Partners, discussed the current state of the market. He noted that companies have had a great quarter, which reflects the fact that the economy is doing well, people have jobs, and they’re buying things, which trickles down to the market. This, in turn, has a positive impact on the tech sector as a whole. However, Bailey advised investors to take a more nuanced approach and consider the specific fundamentals of each company. Bailey believes that large-cap companies have the greatest opportunity to meet or exceed investor expectations for growth. He noted that while small caps are trading cheaper, they may not be the best option for long-term investments or high-conviction plays. Bailey explained that his firm’s approach is focused on identifying companies with strong earnings growth potential, and larger cap companies tend to have more resources and a stronger track record of delivering on their growth promises. However, he did acknowledge that small caps can be a good option for investors who are looking to capitalize on a short-term economic cycle or recovery. Bailey emphasized the importance of looking beyond the top ten stocks that make up 50% of the market, which often dominate the conversation. He suggested that there are plenty of other companies that are worth considering. These companies, according to Bailey, offer a compelling combination of growth potential, valuation, and dividend yield, making them attractive options for investors looking to diversify their portfolios. Furthermore, Bailey emphasized the importance of having a long-term perspective and not getting caught up in short-term market fluctuations. He encouraged investors to focus on the underlying fundamentals of each company and to avoid making emotional decisions based on market volatility. Large-cap companies with stable revenue and consistent net income growth remain attractive options for investors seeking reliable returns and long-term stability.

Title: Thinking about Getting a Costco Membership? Here's How Much You Can Save

Reviews ethics statement Costco offers deals on bulk groceries, home essentials and more. But exactly how much can you save? I did the math. A Costco membership can save you more than $1,000 yearly in groceries alone. Groceries are the biggest ongoing expense for most families after housing, and they've seen an annoying uptick since the pandemic and all its supply chain chaos. In fact, the price of food rose 25% from 2019 to 2023, according to the US Department of Agriculture. One way to combat high supermarket prices is buying in bulk and nowhere is that more easily done that at Costco -- if you have one in your town or city. At Costco, groceries are packaged in larger quantities and sold at cheaper per-pound prices, meaning you can save major dough as long as you have the space to store a 50-pack of paper towels or a 20-pound bag of rice. Shopping at Costco also typically means fewer trips to the store, which translates to less gas. To see exactly how much money you can save by buying bulk groceries from Costco, I decided to price out a grocery list at the wholesale club and a more typical grocery store. After running the numbers, it's possible to save over $1,000 in one year by shopping at Costco instead of a supermarket. Below is a breakdown of how I reached that figure. (And if you get a Costco Executive membership, you could save even more.) Using grocery list templates available online, I assembled a list of 25 typical, staple grocery items that are suitable for longer storage, either in the pantry, refrigerator or freezer. This ruled out most fresh produce with some exceptions. If you're hosting a large gathering, buying produce in bulk may be worthwhile. Bulk shopping doesn't mean buying a year's worth of groceries all at once, but I didn't include anything that wouldn't hold up well for at least a month, with the notion that bulk grocery shopping can be done less often. Bulk buying also requires spending more upfront, which is why Costco's per-item total is considerably higher than Stop & Shop's. Assuming either bi-weekly or monthly consumption of those staple grocery items for a household of one or two people, I came up with the approximate yearly consumption for each. I chose Stop & Shop to represent a conventional grocery retailer, as it's largely considered to be a quality store with median prices, and Costco to represent bulk buying, as its Kirkland Signature products have a bit of a following in their own right -- Costco is the Trader Joe's of the bulk set, for sure. Unless a national brand is otherwise indicated, I used Stop & Shop's SB brand, or the least expensive name-brand product for a given item, to compare to Costco's Kirkland Signature brand. For the Stop & Shop items, coming up with the yearly price for each item was a simple matter of multiplying by 26 for bi-weekly consumption, or 12 for monthly consumption. For Costco's items, I scaled the prices accordingly based on whatever package size Costco offers to indicate a yearly cost for the same amount of a given item. If you can afford the freezer space, buying meat in bulk will save you big money over the course of a year. Since I was primarily interested in food cost savings, I didn't factor in cleaning supplies, paper products or other items, but you can safely assume these also amount to big saving potential over the year when bought in bulk. Also, since my calculations were based on a small household, the bigger your household, the bigger the savings. Costco requires a membership to take advantage of its bulk savings and low-cost signature brands. A basic membership costs $65 a year and is valid at all locations. Read more about the different Costco membership options. The economics of buying in bulk is simple: The more you buy of something at one time, the less it costs per count or unit of weight. Producers, distributors and retailers are able to offer lower prices this way not only because bulk items often require less packaging, but also because for them it's a sure sale over a potential sale -- they'd rather have your money now, even at a discount, than parsed out over a period of time. Shelf-stable items including cereal, sauces and coffee make up some of the biggest savings when buying in bulk. Given this particular grocery list, buying in bulk would allow you to save over $1,000 during the course of a year, representing a 33% savings overall over conventional groceries. (In today's economy, it is worth mentioning that you also save gas money with fewer trips to the store.) In a few cases, the Stop & Shop item ended up being the cheaper option: organic milk, carrots, potatoes and frozen salmon filets, for example. In all of these cases, there wasn't a huge size difference between the conventional and bulk items. Milk is an especially good example, as it's still offered in a larger quantity at Costco, but there's only so much of it you can buy at one time without risking it spoiling, and so the bulk offering is comparatively modest. Costco also doesn't have a Kirkland brand offering of organic milk, whereas Stop & Shop does. The savings for bulk fresh produce were not as significant as pantry staples and shelf-stable groceries. Generally speaking, the larger the scale on the bulk item, the larger the savings. If you buy a 40-ounce quantity of Cheerios, for example, rather than the 12 ounces you get in a typical box, they become nearly 75% cheaper. Buying 25 pounds of white rice all at once instead of 2 pounds at a time saves you 60%. With at least a grand in savings available yearly for just a portion of your grocery list, even if you need to buy additional home storage to accommodate it, the verdict is clear: Bulk grocery shopping is well worth the effort. Some of the biggest savings by percentage come from shelf-stable and pantry items including chips, crackers, jarred sauce, rice and whole-bean coffee. These items are typically easier to store and less likely to spoil or deteriorate in quality. Buying pantry items in bulk from a discount grocer such as Costco represents a clear and risk-free strategy for saving money on your grocery bill over the course of a year.
