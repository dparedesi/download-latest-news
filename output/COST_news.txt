Hello, and RIP to Instagram (sort of). The app is testing out a new feed that opens right into its Reels feature. BI's Katie Notopoulos has more on the change. In other tech news, OpenAI's Sam Altman (yes, the Sam Altman) stopped by the Berlin headquarters of our parent company, Axel Springer. He chatted with the father of quantum computing, and they agreed on a Turing Test 2.0. In today's big story, we're looking at how President Donald Trump's new H-1B visa fee will impact Big Tech, startups, consulting, and Wall Street. What's on deck: Markets: The future of trading is … doing it in person. Wait, what? Tech: The startups making big money by training AI with humans. Business: Costco's new exclusive hours are proving to be a boon for the business. But first, the price of hiring just went up. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. The dust is still settling on President Donald Trump's new H-1B visa fee, but one thing seems clear: Corporate America is in for a shake-up. Late last week, Trump sent businesses into a bit of a tailspin when he announced that each H-1B visa, which allows companies to hire foreign skilled workers for specialized roles, would come with a $100,000 fee. There was some initial confusion about whether that fee applied to current visa holders (it doesn't). But even with the focus only on new visa applicants, the impact is still expected to be big. JPMorgan economists predict the US will see work authorizations drop by 5,500 a month. Business leaders continue to weigh in, with reactions ranging from optimism to concern. And while a lot still remains unknown, we're getting a sense of what it means for different industries. Here's a breakdown on how the new fee could impact some of the industries that rely on the H-1B visa the most. Big Tech: Tech giants are some of the biggest users of H-1B visas, so you'd think the new fee would hurt them the most. But size matters. When your company is worth more than $1 trillion, an extra $100,000 won't move the needle. In fact, you could argue that Big Tech would welcome the fee if it served as a deterrent to smaller competitors going after the same talent. Still, it's not all good news. The scale at which Big Tech companies hire workers on H-1B visas means the costs could eventually add up to billions of dollars for top sponsors. Startups: It's easy to think of startups as high-flying companies with lofty valuations, but the vast majority of them are simply small businesses. And without the deep pockets of their larger peers, startups could be left scrambling in the all-important war for talent. Even if a startup is willing to pay the $100,000 fee, it will almost certainly only do it for the most senior-level employees who have the skills and salary to justify the cost. You could argue that was the original intent of the visa, but the change could also upend the pipeline of young talent working at startups. Consulting: When it rains, it pours. Consultants aren't in a position of power, as we've covered here before, and the fee certainly won't help things. Simply put, consulting is experiencing a talent crisis, and any additional hurdle is likely to make it worse. In some cases, like data scientists and other highly technical roles, the competition for talent will just increase. However, building out offshore hubs in places like India, Mexico, the Philippines, and Argentina, which was already a trend, could be another option to bypass the visa issue entirely, analysts told BI. Wall Street: Financial firms aren't too far behind Big Tech when it comes to using H-1B visas. JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, and Citigroup each have more than a 1,000 certified H-1B filings. However, the calculation of H-1Bs on the Street is different than in Big Tech. A majority of financial firms' H-1B visa roles are focused on technology. And as much as banks and investment firms value their digital transformations, techies aren't as high in the hierarchy as money makers like traders, investment bankers, and wealth managers. Still, the visa feel will be felt on the Street, especially when it comes to Wall Street's junior banker hiring. 1. This retail investing platform wants to take trading IRL. Moomoo is opening a physical retail store in 2026, located in NYC's Herald Square. With human employees there to help, its CEO sees the storefront as an opportunity to increase brand trust and community engagement. 2. The US economy's greatest strength could turn out to be investors' biggest weakness. America's economic resilience has allowed it to escape many recession forecasts over the years. But that could create a blind spot, financial pros told BI. One strategist said investors' complacency is reminiscent of the 1990s. 3. This lowkey billionaire is the real winner of the new iPhone launch. Wang Laisheng's company, Luxshare Precision Industry, started out making accessories for Apple. Now, it assembles iPhones — and the recent iPhone 17 launch sent its stock spiking 32% and Laisheng's net worth to $14.3 billion. The success has even OpenAI knocking on its door. 1. AI companies are shelling out for human trainers. Companies are raising billions to recruit humans to teach chatbots everything from Japanese to finance to memes. Workers can earn hundreds of dollars an hour at some of these companies. See which startups are cashing in. 2. Post-IPO is not the time to rest on your laurels. As Klarna's staff celebrated its $15 billion IPO at its employee conference in Stockholm, CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski shared a stark text he received from chairman Michael Moritz: Klarna was still "10 years behind" a competitor. 3. Keep your friends close. Abridge became a $5.3 billion darling of healthcare tech with the help of medical records giant Epic. Now, Epic is releasing its own tech to compete with Abridge's AI medical scribe. It shows how partners and former shareholders can quickly become competitors. 1. Where does Trump vs. Kimmel go next? It's possible that the president will simply move on from his beef with Kimmel. But regardless of the aftermath, we should still take the whole ordeal seriously, writes BI's Peter Kafka. It's also shown Corporate America that there's one line it can't cross when it comes to free speech. 2. Costco is proving the haters wrong. Some employees were concerned that Costco's plans to open stores early for its executive members would backfire. Foot traffic data from Placer.ai says otherwise. The data indicates that the extended hours are getting customers to shop faster and more frequently. 3. Trump's economic holy trinity is a tough nut to crack. The president has three economic goals: boost US manufacturing, crack down on immigration, and keep prices low. These work fine on their own, or even in pairs, but many economists and trade experts say Trump can't accomplish all three at once. Here's why. Luigi Mangione's federal judge orders DOJ to stop making prejudicial pretrial statements after Trump retweets. Jimmy Kimmel's comeback show reached 6.26 million viewers, Disney says. Sean Combs launched a jailhouse 'Free Game with Diddy' course to teach fellow inmates business skills: lawyers. Disney investors demand internal records on Jimmy Kimmel's suspension, say the board may have breached duties. Honda ends production of its Acura EV in the US, citing 'market conditions.' Nexstar says it's 'engaged in productive discussions' with Disney but won't show Jimmy Kimmel yet. Dan DeFrancesco, deputy executive editor and anchor, in New York.

Title: How To Earn $500 A Month From Costco Stock Ahead Of Q4 Earnings
URL: https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/dividends/25/09/47862562/how-to-earn-500-a-month-from-costco-stock-ahead-of-q4-earnings-2
Time Published: 2025-09-25T14:10:58Z

Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ: COST) will release earnings results for the fourth quarter, after the closing bell on Thursday, Sept. 25. Analysts expect the company to report quarterly earnings at $5.81 per share, up from $5.29 per share in the year-ago period. COST projects quarterly revenue of $86.06 billion, compared to $79.7 billion a year earlier, according to data from Benzinga Pro. Costco has beaten analyst estimates for revenue in two straight quarters and in five of the last 10 quarters overall. With the recent buzz around Costco, some investors may also be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends. Currently, Costco offers an annual dividend yield of 0.55%, which is a semi-annual dividend amount of $1.30 per share ($5.20 a year). So, how can investors exploit its dividend yield to pocket a regular $500 monthly? To earn $500 per month or $6,000 annually from dividends alone, you would need an investment of approximately $1,090,842 or around 1,154 shares. For a more modest $100 per month or $1,200 per year, you would need $218,357 or around 231 shares. To calculate: Divide the desired annual income ($6,000 or $1,200) by the dividend ($5.20 in this case). So, $6,000 / $5.20 = 1,154 ($500 per month), and $1,200 / $5.20 = 231 shares ($100 per month). Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time. How that works: The dividend yield is computed by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stock’s current price. For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and is currently priced at $50, the dividend yield would be 4% ($2/$50). However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price falls to $40, the dividend yield rises to 5% ($2/$40). Similarly, changes in the dividend payment can impact the yield. If a company increases its dividend, the yield will also increase, provided the stock price stays the same. Conversely, if the dividend payment decreases, so will the yield. COST Price Action: Shares of Costco rose 0.2% to close at $945.27 on Wednesday.

Title: The Financial Sector Was Tottering Even Before Trump
URL: https://newrepublic.com/article/200901/financial-sector-tottering-private-equity
Time Published: 2025-09-25T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
I’ve written a good bit about the economic wreckage wrought by President Donald Trump’s economic policies—tariffs, manipulation of the Federal Reserve, a deficit-doubling tax cut for the rich—and how these might tank the economy. Today let’s consider how, even if Trump weren’t president, the finance sector could tank the economy all by its lonesome through shadow banking, most especially in the private equity industry. The term “shadow banking” was coined in 2007 by a money manager named Paul McCulley to describe financial institutions that mimic what commercial banks do—money markets, mortgage companies, investment banks, hedge funds, and, yes, private equity—but are not regulated like banks. It’s called shadow banking because these firms lack banks’ transparency. Shadow banks furnish a higher return than banks typically do, but their investments are much riskier and lack government protections for investors. Much of the mischief in the 2008 financial crisis was caused by shadow banks, whose combined assets were as large or perhaps larger than those of commercial banks. Five years later, shadow banks’ holdings represented nearly 80 percent of global gross domestic product. Nobody disputes this makes the global financial system less secure. Even those parts of the financial system that would seem to have nothing to do with you and me can disrupt our lives. I’d never even heard of “family offices” until I read Chuck Collins’s excellent 2021 book, The Wealth Hoarders: How Billionaires Pay Millions to Hide Trillions. (Clearly, I don’t hang with the right crowd.) Family offices are organizations set up by very rich people to preserve their wealth over multiple generations; they’re more or less Thomas Jefferson’s worst nightmare. Although family offices have been around a long time—the Cabots and the Lowells had them in the nineteenth century—more than half of those now in existence, per Collins, were created in this still-young century. Jeff Bezos’s dad just expanded his. Sometimes family offices combine into multifamily offices, or family funds. Vacationing in Nassau last year, I drove past what looked like a Walmart or Costco; on closer inspection, it was a big-box family fund. (It won’t surprise you to learn that family funds flourish in tax havens like the Bahamas.) Family offices and family funds are perhaps the most blatant engines of what Thomas Piketty calls “patrimonial capitalism.” That makes it tempting to greet the prospect that they might collapse with a hearty, “Good riddance!” And yes, if they declined in some gradual, stately manner like the Magnificent Ambersons, that’s what I’d say too. The trouble is that they’re at least equally likely to decline abruptly, taking the rest of us down with them. As The Economist observed in 2018, “Family offices could endanger the stability of the financial system. Combining very rich people, opacity, and markets can be very expensive.” When the family fund Archegos went bust in 2021, it cost Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley more than $10 billion, with ripple effects in the stock market of $33 billion. If your retirement fund held stock in CBS or Discovery then it was hard cheese for you. The corner of shadow banking that appears shakiest today is private equity, which is what we called leveraged buyouts before the convicted junk-bond king Michael Milken gave them a bad name in the late 1980s. Private equity firms use debt to buy existing firms; manage them to be more profitable, typically through layoffs; then take them public. Defenders of the practice used to say this made the target companies more efficient. But today almost everybody who doesn’t work in private equity hates private equity for loading up companies with insurmountable debt and raking in so much money on fees that private equity firms don’t have to care all that much whether this or that company survives. Another common criticism is that private equity puts the squeeze on certain enterprises—hospitals, retirement homes, even hospice providers—that were never intended to be profit-maximizers, weakening the quality of the vital social services they provide. Can’t afford to buy a house? In his latest book, Burned by Billionaires: How Concentrated Wealth and Power Are Ruining Our Lives and Planet, Collins demonstrates various ways in which private equity drives up housing costs. One Ohio firm invests in short-term and vacation rentals—Airbnb, Vrbo, etc.—to the tune of $1.5 billion, with capital from the Blackstone Group and other 800-pound gorillas in private equity. Lately I’ve had trouble reconciling two story lines in the financial press about private equity. One story line is that private equity is taking over the world. The other is that private equity is on the verge of extinction. Bethany McLean, the superb financial reporter who last week started a column in The Washington Post, squared the circle in her inaugural essay by explaining that private equity is swallowing up everything in sight precisely because it’s in financial trouble. McLean’s piece was about President Donald Trump’s executive order last month directing the Labor Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission to ease fiduciary requirements to encourage people to invest their 401(k)s in private equity and other “alternative assets,” by which Trump meant shadow banks. As it happens, Blackstone’s chief executive, Stephen Schwarzman, gave $37 million to Republican and conservative groups in the last election cycle. I’m sure that’s just a coincidence. Trying to herd grandma into private equity is insane. The rationale for private equity going unregulated is that the customers are either rich people or investors for giant pension and other funds who are savvy enough to take risks you and I shouldn’t, and rich enough that, should the risk go sour, no great harm is done. That’s the precise opposite circumstance from defined-contribution pensions, which until now have been regulated to the hilt to protect grandma from getting swindled. McLean doesn’t put it as bluntly as I do here, but her bottom line is that while you don’t particularly need private equity, “it is absolutely clear that private equity needs you—or rather, the trillions of dollars Americans have in our retirement accounts. Without our money, the industry is slamming into a brick wall of its own making.” I phoned McLean to ask her whether that brick wall is something that you and I need to worry about. Might private equity take us down with it? Absolutely, she replied. “Private equity has become too big to fail,” she said, “which raises a whole question of whether it should be private at all.” The solution, McLean said, is to regulate private equity as we do commercial banks and public corporations, with comparable transparency and legal limits on what it can do with our money. Private equity started to falter around the time Lina Khan became chair of the Federal Trade Commission, because any limit on mergers is a limit on how private equity firms reassemble the companies they acquire. Rising interest rates dealt another blow. Mostly, though, private equity was a victim of its own success. It ran out of things to buy and bid up the price of whatever was left. Default rates for private equity–backed companies, McLean pointed out, hit 17 percent during the previous three years, more than double the rate for companies not backed by private equity. By 2022, nearly half of all the supposedly slimmed-down and tuned-up companies exiting private equity firms were sold to other private equity firms, prompting one investor to tell The Financial Times, “This is the start of, potentially, I’m saying ‘potentially,’ a pyramid scheme.” In January, the FT columnist John Plender, writing about systemic risks in private equity, concluded: “No prizes for guessing where the next financial crisis will emerge from.” Of course, Trump doesn’t help matters by urging us all to throw our money into private equity and other risky shadow banks. But barring strict regulation of this sector to a degree that seems politically impossible at the moment, these outlaw financial institutions are fully capable of crashing the economy on their own.

Title: I've had an executive Costco membership for 10 years. It pays for itself — and then some.

Time Published: 2025-09-23T15:53:28Z
Full Content:
Costco has always been a part of my life. I remember taking family trips to the warehouse as a kid and sharing soft-serve with my siblings. When I moved away for college, I still asked my parents to take me to Costco, often "borrowing" their membership card for big shopping trips to stock up on food and household items. Later, my partner and I went all in, splurging on our own executive membership and even getting the Costco Citi card. Now, as adults, we're at Costco multiple times each month, filling up on everything from gas to groceries. We make almost all our large purchases there, and have even booked Costco vacation packages. As a longtime shopper, I can confidently say the benefits of a Costco executive membership are worthwhile. Here's why I think it's worth upgrading to the higher membership tier. A standard Costco membership costs $65 a year, and the executive version is double the price at $130 annually. However, we recover the cost of the upgrade just by making qualifying purchases at the warehouse. That's because the executive membership comes with a 2% cash back reward, which allows shoppers to earn up to $1,250 back on qualifying pre-tax purchases. To break it down, this means that if we spend about $3,250 a year at Costco, we earn back the cost of the executive membership upgrade. If we spend a little more, we're making money to spend at the warehouse. Once a year — about two months before our membership renews — Costco sends a cash back voucher, which can be redeemed on future purchases. Plus, Costco has a membership satisfaction guarantee, meaning the company will refund the price of the membership at any time if you're not satisfied with it. In addition to the 2% cash back perk, Costco executive members can often access extra benefits. For example, the company recently started giving executive members a $10 monthly credit to use on same-day delivery through Instacart. The credit is automatically applied at checkout when we spend $150 (before tax). After returning home from vacation, this perk was a game changer. Instead of fighting the weekend Costco crowds to stock up on our favorite products, our groceries were delivered promptly to our doorstep. We were even able to snag a coveted rotisserie chicken. And speaking of vacations, executive members also get extra benefits on trips booked through Costco Travel. A few years ago, I purchased an all-inclusive vacation package to Costa Rica. As part of the deal, my friend and I each received $50 to use at the spa and a complimentary fruit basket for our room. Earlier this year, Costco announced it would be opening its doors for an additional six and a half hours each week for US executive members. Now, we can begin shopping at the warehouse an hour early on weekdays and Sundays. On Saturdays, we can enter half an hour earlier than other members. We recently attended this special shopping hour on a Sunday and noticed a stark difference. For example, my store typically has a line out the door to get in at opening, but we were able to stroll right in without bumping into anyone. We didn't even have to wait in line to check out. We'll likely make it a habit to go during these exclusive hours, as it made for a much better experience overall. I've been shopping at Costco for as long as I can remember, and I don't plan on stopping anytime soon. Costco's greatest draws are its ability to provide value for the price and an unbeatable customer experience. For my partner and me, paying for the executive membership is a no-brainer. The 2% cash back means our $130 annual membership pays for itself. Plus, we love having access to all the premium perks. Jump to

Title: Fed Easing Cycle Resumes: Market Implications

ByBill Stone, Contributor. Following the Federal Reserve rate cut last Wednesday, the S&P 500 closed at an all-time high last Friday. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed the market. As outlined previously, the Federal Reserve delivered a 25-basis-point cut at its September 17 meeting. The statement from the committee said, “downside risks to employment have risen,” which indicates that the recent softness in the monthly jobs reports has shifted the Fed back into easing mode after a nine-month hiatus. The median projections from the Fed call for 25-basis point cuts in October and December. Previously, the Fed only expected a cut at one of those meetings. Markets have also priced in at the October and December Fed meetings. Notably, the Fed’s increase in the number of median rate cuts was by a very narrow margin, so these cuts are far from a sure thing with incoming data remaining crucial. Both two-year and ten-year Treasury yields are well below their highs for the year. As the threat of recession has waned, as illustrated by the lower betting odds of recession, stocks have rallied. At the early April stock lows, the massive US tariffs announced on Liberation Day sent the betting odds of recession soaring to 65%. As the tariff threat eased and some progress was made on trade agreements, stocks have recovered sharply. Recession odds declined following the Fed rate cut announcement, and stocks reached a new all-time closing high. The more economically sensitive cyclical stocks outperformed less economically impacted defensives last week, and since the stocks bottomed in early April, coinciding with the peak of recession fears. The lessening of the odds of recession benefited the more economically sensitive stocks. Beyond this relationship, smaller capitalization stocks, using the Russell 2000 as an example, have outperformed recently. Furthermore, bank stocks have continued to outperform, benefiting from a better economic outlook and a steeper yield curve. The most direct beneficiaries of the rate cut are companies (and households) with floating-rate debt. Another transmission mechanism for lower short-term rates to positively impact the economy is the housing sector. As housing affordability hovers near all-time lows since 1989, part of the equation has been due to higher mortgage rates. This lack of affordability is most pronounced for first-time homebuyers. The expectation of a decline in short-term rates has led to the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage dropping from a high of 7.41% in January to 6.37% most recently. The US housing market has been limping along with a depressed level of new single-family home building. Permits for new single-family home construction show a similar poor outlook for home building. While mortgage applications for home purchases remain depressed, the trend has been moving higher since mortgage rates peaked. Notably, mortgage applications for refinancing have spiked with the lower mortgage rates. Importantly, this puts extra cash in the pockets of US households. Unfortunately, this refinancing cycle is likely to be less potent than previous cycles due to the significant amount of refinancing that occurred when rates were at ultra-low levels during the pandemic. There are only seven companies in the S&P 500 scheduled to report earnings, with Costco (COST) and Micron Technology (MU) being the most notable for their economic insights. There are a whopping eighteen speeches from Federal Reserve members scheduled for this week. This Fedspeak will be closely watched for clues as to the timing of future rate cuts, none more so than Fed Chair Powell’s speech on Tuesday. Stocks continue to price in low odds of recession, given the strong performance of small companies, banks, and the more economically sensitive cyclical stocks. The Fed’s cut last week, along with the expectation of two more cuts this year, reinforced the notion that the soft spot in the labor market will not develop into a full-fledged downturn. The positive boost from easing monetary policy is lagged and variable, so it will be imperative to monitor the impact to ascertain if it is consistent with market expectations. There is little doubt that lower rates will have less potency than in previous cycles and may come at a more significant lag, given the legacy of ultra-low interest rates during the pandemic.

Title: There's a New Way to Play Quarterly Earnings With Polymarket's Latest Rollout

There's a new way to make a buck on companies' earnings reports—and in some ways, this one may be the most straightforward. Predictions marketplace Polymarket last week rolled out a new category of contracts that lets users put money on whether or not a company will beat Wall Street's expectations. It's a departure from what could be considered the traditional methods involving stocks and derivatives, but it's also a simplified way for people to profit from publicly-traded companies' bottom lines. A handful of well-known companies, including Micron Tech (MU), CarMax (KMX), and Costco (COST), are due to report in the coming weeks, and Polymarket has contracts for all of them. Here's how the new offering will work: Users can bet on the question of whether Costco will beat its quarterly estimate for earnings per share. At recent prices, a "yes" bet costs 79 cents and a "no" is 22 cents, indicating that the latter is seen as less likely. That means a winning $100 wager could result in a net profit of $21 on a beat, or $78 on a miss. Bloomberg's consensus estimates are used to determine wins and losses; if earnings aren't reported as scheduled, and don't land within 45 days, the contract is resolved as a "no." (If the earnings match estimates, it's a loss.) A wrong bet leaves you with nothing. There are, of course, other ways to go about this. One could trade a company's stock—long or short—or associated call and put options ahead of earnings reports, but those aren't so much direct bets on the results as tied to price movements that could be driven by the company's forward guidance, how optimistic or pessimistic management sounded during its earnings call, the earnings themselves, or other factors. When buying the stock, of course, you also own an asset that, broadly speaking, can be held as long as desired. Other prediction markets, like Kalshi, offer contracts on what might be mentioned on a company's earnings call, but not one specifically for earnings beats. Polymarket's new contracts are part of a broader trend marrying moneyed matters with social media. The prediction market platform launched the earnings report bets as they partnered with StockTwits, where users of the finance-focused social media platform will be able to view the probabilities of market-moving events on Polymarket directly in its app. Polymarket contracts aren't yet available in the U.S., though that seems to be moving closer to reality. The company is in the middle of a comeback in the U.S. after the the Commodity and Futures Trading Commission and Justice Department ended a probe into the company without filing charges. Polymarket did not respond to Investopedia's request for comment on the timing of its U.S. launch in time for publication. "Polymarket has been given the green light to go live in the USA by the @CFTC. Credit to the Commission and Staff for their impressive work. This process has been accomplished in record timing," Shayne Coplan, chief of Polymarket, said on social media in reference to the regulator's no-action letter on events contracts earlier this month.

Title: What to Expect in Markets This Week: Inflation Data; Fed Speakers; Earnings from Micron, Costco

The Fed is back to cutting rates. What'll it do next? We'll learn more this week. After last week's decision by the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates for the first time this year, market watchers will be eager for clues about whether more cuts are in store in the coming months. Several data points due this week should offer insight. Stocks ended last week on the rise, with all three major U.S. indexes finishing at record highs. The Fed’s preferred inflation measure comes as policymakers watch for evidence that tariffs are working their way into consumer prices. A string of Fed officials will deliver remarks over the course of the week investors will parse for hints about the possibility of further cuts at this year's two remaining meetings. The final revision to second-quarter gross domestic product (GDP) will also be in focus, as will data on home sales, jobless claims, and consumer sentiment. Traders will be watching for earnings from chipmaker Micron, retailer Costco, and used car seller CarMax. Read to the bottom for our calendar of key events—and one more thing. The Personal Consumption Expenditures index for August is set to be released on Friday. PCE inflation held relatively steady in July after accelerating in June. Friday's report will be the first reading on prices since Fed Chair Jerome Powell warned that elevated inflation and a weakening labor market give policymakers "no risk-free path" forward. The Fed has projected that it’s likely to cut interest rates at upcoming meetings, but Powell said officials will be closely watching economic readings before making further moves. Several Fed officials are on the speaking calendar this week, including Powell and the Fed's newest member, Stephen Miran. Economists on Thursday will get the final revision to second-quarter GDP, which was revised higher in August. Data for both new and pending home sales in August comes amid a decline in mortgage rates in recent weeks. Data on consumer sentiment, jobless claims, and durable-goods orders are also on tap. On the corporate calendar, Micron Technology is scheduled to report results on Tuesday. The chipmaker in June reported record quarterly revenue amid booming demand for its memory chips from data center clients. Analysts are generally bullish on Micron stock, which hit a record high last week. Costco is set to report its quarterly results on Thursday. In May, the bulk retailer reported sales rose by 8% amid continued growth in same-store sales. Recent retail sales data suggested that consumers are still spending. CarMax’s earnings on the same day will provide insight into the state of the used-car market. Auto parts seller AutoZone, business services provider Cintas, and advisory firm Accenture will also report this week. Quick Links: Recap Last Week’s Trading | Latest Markets News Monday, Sept. 22 Tuesday, Sept. 23 Wednesday, Sept. 24 Thursday, Sept. 25 Friday, Sept. 26 The Federal Reserve has come through with its much-anticipated interest rate cut. But what are the implications for your savings account? Investopedia’s Sabrina Karl explains what the rate cut means for savers here.
