ByRobert Daugherty ByRobert Daugherty, Contributor. Moody's lowered the sovereign credit rating of the US, joining S&P and Fitch in stripping America's AAA status. While this is historic and will attract media attention, it reveals what has long been the Federal government's poor governance and management. Spending more than it collects in taxes and lacking the courage to make difficult decisions and think long term. The current administration is admirably trying to right the financial ship. However, its on-again, off-again tariffs will never collect the intended revenue. Additionally, its proposed tax reductions come without corresponding serious spending cuts or addressing entitlement payments. While the Federal government operates under different constraints than states, a comparative fiscal analysis proves instructive. Washington State's prudent financial governance stands in stark contrast to Washington DC's struggle with fiscal discipline. The state maintains exemplary creditworthiness through constitutional balanced budget requirements and strategic reserve mechanisms that have earned it high ratings from credit agencies—precisely the credentials the federal government has now lost. Washington State's economic fundamentals further distinguish it: the state ranks among national leaders in both median household income and GDP per capita. As federal fiscal challenges mount under the weight of escalating debt, Washington State's diversified economy continues to thrive, powered by a formidable technology sector, robust job creation, and sustained investment in innovation that positions the region for continued long-term growth despite broader economic headwinds. Looking specifically at Washington state, one can imagine an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) that would likely best the S&P 500 with names like Costco (COST), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Redfin (RDFN) and Weyerhaeuser (WY). For investors seeking above-average long-term equity returns, these value stocks are primed to deliver. There are three Seattle-based companies that are worth buying now: Nordstrom (ticker JWN), Starbucks (SBUX) and Alaska Air Group (ALK), all of which offer attractive long-term returns. Nordstrom represents one of Seattle's most iconic retail success stories. Founded in 1901, this luxury department store chain has built a reputation for exceptional customer service and premium merchandise. After facing headwinds in recent years from e-commerce competition and pandemic disruptions, Nordstrom is executing a compelling turnaround strategy focused on omnichannel integration and its off-price Nordstrom Rack division. The company's most recent quarterly earnings exceeded Wall Street expectations, with stronger-than-anticipated same-store sales growth and improved margins. Nordstrom reports earnings on June 6th, so stay tuned to hear more about their turnaround plans. Despite the challenging retail environment created by the current administration's ADHD governance style which has whipsawed markets, Nordstrom remains on track to hit its 2025 guidance—no easy task in today's unpredictable economic landscape. The company's loyal, high-income customer base provides resilience during economic uncertainty. Nordstrom's digital investments are paying dividends with robust online growth, while its brick-and-mortar footprint remains strategically valuable in prime locations. The stock currently trades at attractive valuations compared to historical averages, suggesting significant upside potential as discretionary spending rebounds. Nordstrom's management team has demonstrated discipline in inventory management and cost controls while maintaining the premium shopping experience that differentiates the brand. Their focus on exclusive merchandise partnerships and personalized styling services creates competitive advantages that pure e-commerce players struggle to replicate. Seattle's global coffee empire is positioned for renewed growth after recent operational challenges. Starbucks' unmatched brand loyalty and extensive retail network of over 38,000 stores worldwide provide enormous competitive advantages. The company's strategic initiatives under new leadership are addressing operational inefficiencies while expanding digital capabilities and strengthening customer connections. Starbucks delivered a standout quarterly performance that surpassed analyst expectations across key metrics, including comparable store sales and operating margins. The company has projected $0.67 per share in the third quarter versus $0.41 per share in the second quarter. Despite navigating supply chain disruptions and consumer spending fluctuations caused by the administration's erratic policy shifts that have whipsawed markets, the company confidently reaffirmed its 2025 guidance—demonstrating remarkable operational discipline in an unpredictable environment. Starbucks continues to see strong international growth, particularly in China where the company is expanding its footprint despite near-term economic headwinds. The brand's ongoing menu innovation and premium positioning allow it to maintain pricing power even in inflationary environments. The company's rewards program boasts over 30 million active members in the U.S. alone, driving repeat business and higher average tickets. Recent stock price weakness presents an attractive entry point for long-term investors, with the company's robust free cash flow supporting both dividend growth and share repurchases. Starbucks' dividend yield currently exceeds historical averages, providing income while investors wait for the growth initiatives to fully materialize. LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - DECEMBER 04: An Alaska Airlines plane takes off from Los Angeles ... More International Airport (LAX) on December 4, 2023 in Los Angeles, California. Alaska Airlines has announced it plans to purchase rival Hawaiian Airlines in a $1.9 billion deal which must be approved by federal regulators. (Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images) This Seattle-based airline has built a reputation for operational excellence and customer satisfaction. Alaska Air Group has successfully integrated Virgin America while expanding its routes and partnerships to create a more competitive national network. The carrier's strong presence along the West Coast positions it ideally to benefit from the region's economic dynamism and population growth. Alaska Air's quarterly results flew past expectations with impressive load factors and revenue per available seat mile, despite the turbulence created by volatile fuel prices and changing travel regulations. Alaska expects to earn $1.54 per share in the third quarter on $3.5 billion in revenue, up from $3.2 billion in the second quarter. The airline has skillfully navigated the unpredictable policy environment—characterized by the current administration's ADHD governance style that has whipsawed markets—and remains firmly on course to achieve its ambitious 2025 financial and operational targets. Alaska's fleet modernization program is improving fuel efficiency and reducing maintenance costs, strengthening its cost structure compared to legacy carriers. The company maintains one of the industry's strongest balance sheets with relatively low debt levels, providing financial flexibility to weather industry cyclicality and invest in growth opportunities. The airline's loyalty program and credit card partnerships generate high-margin revenue streams that complement its core operations. Alaska's management team has demonstrated disciplined capacity growth and pricing strategies that prioritize profitability over market share. Recent expansion into premium cabin offerings addresses higher-yield business travelers while maintaining its value proposition for leisure customers. SEATTLE, WA - (Photo by Donald Miralle/Getty Images ) These three companies exemplify the broader economic strengths of Washington state. While federal finances deteriorate, Seattle-based enterprises benefit from the state's fiscal discipline, educated workforce, and innovation ecosystem. Investors seeking refuge from national economic challenges would be wise to consider these Washington state stalwarts for their portfolios. Their combination of established market positions, turnaround potential, and exposure to the dynamic Pacific Northwest economy offers compelling long-term value.

Title: Walmart’s tariff price hikes are likely weeks away

Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Walmart said in February that it wasn’t “immune” from the costs of President Donald Trump’s tariffs. Now it’s preparing shoppers to pay more, potentially within weeks. The retail giant is likely to start rolling out tariff-related price hikes “towards the tail end of this month, and I certainly expect more in June,” Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey told CNBC on Thursday, as the company reported earnings that exceeded Wall Street’s expectations. Sales rose by 4.5% at U.S. stores, and the company’s e-commerce business notched its first profitable quarter. Walmart is the nation’s largest private-sector employer, with a 1.6 million-strong U.S. workforce and 4,700 locations, which it says are within 10 miles of 90% of the population. The company pulled in $165.6 billion in revenue in the first quarter. It’s a challenging environment to operate in retail right now. Walmart Chief Financial officer John David Rainey But despite Walmart’s huge footprint at the center of the consumer economy, Rainey said “it’s a challenging environment to operate in retail right now,” speaking separately Thursday to Bloomberg. He indicated the Trump administration has further to go to resolve cost pressures that have risen at a scale and speed without “historical precedent,” echoing analysts on the heels of recent truces with the U.K. and China. Walmart’s stock was trading about 3.6% lower Thursday morning following its earnings report. Since Trump unveiled sweeping global tariffs on April 2 — then partially walked them back days later — its shares have risen 3.4%, outpacing the gains of Target and Costco, and remain up 2.9% since the start of the year. CEO Doug McMillon told investors Thursday that Trump’s 145% tariffs on China have had “the biggest impact” on the many toys and electronics Walmart sources there. He thanked the president for recent “progress” after the U.S. agreed to lower its effective tariff rate on China to 30% for a few months. “We’re hopeful that it leads to a longer-term agreement” and lower duties, he said. Rainey added on the investor call that many tariffs remain too high. Duties that in some cases are “approaching 50% for other countries is not a good outcome for retailers, not a good outcome for the economy,” he said. “Real prosperity is American workers being able to support their families and communities because they have good jobs that pay well and provide dignity,” White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement. These goals matter more than “cheap Chinese toys,” he said, and pointed to cooler wholesale and consumer inflation data for April released this week. Walmart is feeling pressure to raise prices on bananas, avocados, coffee and roses due to tariffs on Costa Rica, Peru and Colombia, McMillon said. He promised the retailer would “do our best to control what we can control in order to keep food prices as low as possible.” That could include absorbing higher prices and opting to “not simply pass on a tariff cost attributable to each item individually,” McMillon said. “We also have suppliers shifting materials from tariff-impacted components like aluminum to fiberglass, where there is no tariff. Our merchants, sourcing team and suppliers are being creative.” Walmart is firing the starting gun on a period of price increases. Neil Saunders, managing director, globaldata Large companies typically have the most leeway to make adjustments like these. For many smaller operators, tariffs pose an existential threat that could allow big corporate rivals to expand their market shares, as the powerful U.S. Chamber of Commerce and independent shop owners themselves have warned. “If Walmart’s coming out — with its scale and its buying power and its focus — and saying prices are going to rise, everyone else is going to have to follow suit,” said Neil Saunders, managing director at retail consultancy GlobalData. “Walmart is firing the starting gun on a period of price increases.” Already, a number of companies that sell products at Walmart, such as Stanley Black & Decker, Adidas, Mattel and Procter & Gamble, have raised prices or signaled expected hikes. “Should the duties go away, there will of course not be price increases,” Adidas CEO Bjorn Gulden said in late April. “Should this duty stay or even be higher, then of course it will cause a price increase in the market in general.” Saunders said he expects grocery prices across the retail industry to rise 3% to 5% by the end of this year, while merchandise more dependent on global sourcing could jump by 5% to 7%. “It’s not just the odd 1% that people can almost absorb and ignore,” he said. “We’re looking at reasonably substantial inflation.” Other big-box retailers, including Home Depot, Lowes, Target and BJ’s Wholesale, are set to report first-quarter earnings next week. Several major consumer brands have already revised or scrapped their financial outlooks for the rest of the year, struggling to game out how ever-shifting trade policies will affect them. Walmart, for its part, maintained its 2025 sales and profit guidance. But it decided not to offer guidance on operating income or earnings per share for the second quarter now underway, due to “the range of near-term outcomes being exceedingly wide and difficult to predict.” Nationwide, retail sales rose just 0.1% in April, down sharply from a revised 1.7% increase in March, new federal data showed Thursday. Last month’s level was in line with analysts’ expectations but reflects consumers tightening their belts after a buying spree in which many scooped up products before more tariffs hit. Walmart said Thursday that it brought in new customers last month and saw growth among shoppers of all income levels. “They’re maybe a little concerned about possible looming price increases,” Rainey told CNBC. But so far, “their behaviors largely have not changed,” he said. “They’re still looking for value.” Steve Kopack is a producer at NBC News covering business and the economy. J.J.

Title: At This $5 Billion Ohio Advisory, Financial Planning Comes With A Wall Of Touch Screens And A Dose Of AI

BySergei Klebnikov BySergei Klebnikov, Forbes Staff. CEO Craig Findley works in the Venture Lab. Walking into Venture Visionary Partners’ gleaming Sylvania, Ohio headquarters just outside of Toledo feels less like entering a wealth management firm and more like stepping into the lobby of a Silicon Valley innovator. A serene waterfall greets you at the door; sleek glass offices line the halls, while oversized digital screens pulse with real-time data and market updates. But the real centerpiece—and increasingly a beating heart of the operation—is tucked beyond the conference rooms up on the second floor: the Venture Visionary Lab. A brainchild of founder and CEO Craig Findley, the high tech control room is an unusual setting for a wealth management industry steeped in virtues like patience and measured growth. “It’s like having a second brain in the room,” argues Findley with a smile, gesturing to the space where every wall is a floor-to-ceiling touch screen. Essentially a war room meant to resemble a mini New York Stock Exchange, it combines institutional-grade investment research with Venture’s proprietary tools—and a heavy dose of cutting-edge AI, powered by OpenAI. The Lab is both an R&D center and an expensive client marketing tool used to impress its mostly midwestern clientele. "It helps clients see that we take this seriously," says Findley, 55, a finance and marketing major who graduated from Michigan’s Hillsdale College, a small, Christian, liberal arts school, in 1992. And for clients who love tech? "They’re frankly blown away." Originally envisioned as a trading, research and collaboration hub, the Lab has evolved into something much more ambitious. The room’s four walls are giant, interactive planar screens, connected to laptops through a simple barcode device. Facial recognition is required for entry, and a virtual AI assistant—cheerily nicknamed "Venture"—is ready to take notes, pull up investment research, or even recall a client’s last conversation at a moment's notice. Soon, Findley hopes, the Lab will be fully voice interactive. "Eventually, it will greet us—and clients—when we walk in," he says. Today, it's already partially there: Ask Venture about a company or client, and within seconds it retrieves curated information drawn from its approved research sources and CRM system. Founded in 2019, the $5.1 billion (assets under management) registered investment advisory firm prides itself on building deep, personalized relationships with clients, but now technology has supercharged that approach. All that high technology is not free. Findley figures his outfitting Venture Visionary Lab cost him no less than $500,000 to complete. In terms of fees, his firm traditionally charges 1% to 1.5% of assets, according to its SEC filings. One of the keys to Findley’s approach is the quality of his data inputs. New clients fill out a 62-question personality and values assessment, probing everything from relationship priorities to legacy goals. Questions vary from seemingly trivial matters about whether a client has hired a lawyer or made up a will to to more in-depth enquiries such as the core values that guide their work and personal lives. Once complete, a client’s answers are reflected back to them across the Lab’s vast digital screen in a personalized “mind map.” While this discovery process isn’t new for Venture, displaying these answers for clients in the Lab over recent months has not only made it a more interactive process but also more efficient, where Findley and his team can better identify client priorities. “It allows us to better get in the weeds during the discovery process,” he adds. The Lab doesn’t just wow clients—it helps Venture's advisors work smarter with its AI capturing meeting notes and assigns follow ups. If a client mentioned their daughter’s college acceptance during a meeting six months ago? Venture will remember—and suggest a timely congratulatory follow-up at the next touchpoint. Investment committee meetings take place inside the Venture lab. The Lab also plays a helpful role in Venture Visionary Partners’ process as a tool during investment committee meetings. Say Findley and his team are looking at Tesla stock for instance. The AI assistant can quickly pull up summarized analyst reports, financial documents and earnings calls for review, helping the firm spot patterns faster when it comes to portfolio management. They have also begun leveraging Boosted.ai’s Alfa chatbot to improve the efficiency and accuracy of market research. For instance, the team recently prompted Alfa to analyze Russell 1000 companies that reported earnings over the past three months and identify those that beat both EPS and revenue estimates. “We then paired that data with Seeking Alpha’s Earnings Revision Scores to highlight ‘triple beat’ companies—those that not only exceeded earnings and revenue expectations but also raised forward guidance,” says Findley. The firm’s flagship strategy is rising dividend stocks, primarily focusing on U.S. large-cap companies. For more aggressive investors, Venture offers a growth-at-a-reasonable-price strategy that seeks to capture long-term capital appreciation without chasing overheated momentum stocks. For opportunities that don’t neatly fit either profile, the firm runs an opportunistic strategy, giving the investment team flexibility to pursue compelling outliers. Some of the team’s top stock picks from these strategies include tech giants Meta and Amazon, which are trading at lower price to earnings multiples than slow-growth consumer staples like Coke and lower than top retailers Walmart and Costco, respectively. Findley also likes brokerage app Robinhood, which he says was undervalued after the market drop in April and should continue to perform well thanks to rapid earnings growth. Another top stock pick is Morgan Stanley, which could see robust growth on the back of increased corporate dealmaking and rising markets. “The stock is still 11% below the February high and trades at a fairly reasonable 14 times earnings,” says Findley. Venture also offers an ETF-based strategy that balances passive investing with tactical tilts toward sectors like technology and communications. On the fixed income side, the firm is content to take advantage of higher near-term yields by investing in government bonds, structured notes, and private credit opportunities. “We try to take the emotions out of investing," Findley says. "Clients get so caught up in politics or short-term news. History—and a visual—is worth a thousand words.” That discipline has been particularly important in recent months, as a barrage of headlines relating to Trump administration policies have whipsawed markets. Though major indexes like the S&P 500 tanked more than 10% following Trump’s initial tariff announcements in early April, the market has since leveled out and is now once again positive for the year. “Tariff policy, although well intended, caused considerable uncertainty,” says Findley. When asked about the future, Findley’s has a clear vision: Even more integration and automation for the client experience and decision-making process—but always with a human touch. “I want a client to walk into the Lab, have it recognize them by face, greet them personally, recall their last visit, and pull up everything we need without lifting a finger,” he says. But will Findley’s expensive AI-fueled rocketship also help create higher returns for Venture Visionary’s clients? The jury is still out.

Title: Trump's trade agreement with China is another big win for investors

Hello there! Want to be a LinkedIn influencer? (Yes, that's a real thing.) A recent study that included interviews with more than two dozen influencers broke down the key things to remember when building that network. In today's big story, the stock market popped after a temporary trade agreement between the US and China was reached. We look at what some top Wall Street minds expect going forward. Don't forget to subscribe to Tech Memo, a weekly BI newsletter from Alistair Barr. Sign up here! What's on deck Markets: Check out five of Goldman Sachs' AI tools aiming to revolutionize how its employees work. Tech: Amazon is rekindling with its old flame FedEx, according to a document obtained by BI. Business: Costco's gold bars are such a hot commodity, the retailer put new limits on buying them. But first, another big win for investors. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. President Donald Trump's tariffs had investors heading for the hills. A little over a month later, they can't come back fast enough. An agreement between the US and China to significantly reduce tariffs for 90 days sent the market skyrocketing. Major indexes gained considerable ground, erasing the losses from Trump's April 2 "Liberation Day." In all honesty, we should have seen this coming. On May 8, Trump told a press pool at the White House, "You better go out and buy stock now." It was the second time in the past few months that Trump has telegraphed market-moving news coming down the pipeline by urging people to buy stocks. Now, investors who followed Trump's advice are sitting pretty. Tech stocks, including the all-important Magnificent Seven, were up big since many have supply chains and/or customers tied to China. And stocks weren't the only thing heading in the right direction. The progress made on US-China trade talks has people less fearful of a recession. Betting markets dropped the chances down to 40% from 52%, where it was last week. Can the stock market's good vibes last, though? That's what some of the brightest minds on Wall Street tried to think through when reacting to the news. Here's a rundown of their thoughts. Not to be a party pooper, but the trade agreement reached between the US and China is still only temporary. The two sides must iron out many issues before anything permanent is established. Let's not forget the actual tariffs. Both sides have significantly lowered the trade taxes against each other (China 125% to 10%, US 145% to 30%), but the risk remains. Fed Gov. Adriana Kugler said Monday that the current trade policies still "appear likely to generate significant economic effects even if tariffs stay close to the currently announced levels." Roger Altman, founder of investment bank Evercore, estimated the US's overall tariff rate is around 14% compared to 3-4% during President Joe Biden's administration. All of that is to say, the concerns economists have always had about Trump's trade policy — a rise in inflation, slower economic growth — are still very much on the table. 1. How Goldman Sachs is supercharging employees with AI. The bank's GS AI Platform has been growing its suite of tools aimed to boost employees' productivity. BI spoke with multiple Goldman executives over the past year and compiled intel on five of its AI tools. Here's everything we know. 2. Retirement travel dreams, deferred. BI spoke to several retirees who planned on spending their golden years traveling. Now, between rising costs and financial concerns, they said they're either finding creative ways to afford it or rethinking their plans altogether. 3. Another House representative made money on tariff turmoil. It's not just Marjorie Taylor Greene: Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz bought tens of thousands of dollars of stock during the market chaos in April. Both lawmakers say their trades were made by an outside financial advisor. 1. Amazon is getting back together with its (Fed)Ex. The two companies, which split in 2019, signed a partnership deal in late February, according to an internal document obtained by BI. Amazon cited FedEx's "cost favorability" over UPS, which previously said it would reduce its shipping volume for Amazon packages over profitability concerns. 2. The tortoise and the hare. Last week, Bill Gates announced plans to close the Gates Foundation in the next 20 years. Instead of the foundation winding down spending, he's ramping it up. It's a stark contrast to Elon Musk's chainsaw-wielding approach with DOGE — and Musk could take some notes. 3. The women powering little tech in 2025. Meet BI's Seed 40, our annual list of the best women early-stage investors with a knack for spotting and working alongside founders. This year's honorees have placed bets across some of 2025's hottest verticals, from AI to health tech. 1. Tariffs are going to hit Gen Z especially hard. In the face of tariff price hikes, Gen Z is already disadvantaged by having less wealth than other generations. But tariffs could hit some Gen Z-specific products to the point of extinction, from Korean beauty products to anxiety meds. 2. Costco tries to stem the gold rush. The wholesaler has been putting limits on purchases of gold and other precious metals in recent months. Gold prices have been on a tear this year, and even with earlier restrictions, Costco said its inventory had sold out "within a few hours." 3. Temu's left out of Trump's tariff reprieve. Although goods from China are being taxed at 30% and not 145% for the next 90 days, Temu and Shein are still subject to high duties which remain on small packages shipped directly from China. Fortunately, Temu has a workaround. Cannes Film Festival begins. The Business Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York. Hallam Bullock, senior editor, in London.
