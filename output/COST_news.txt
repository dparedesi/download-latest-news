ERIC KIM Ultimately when people study Warren Buffett, Charlie Munger etc ,,, what all these guys are searching for is wisdom. I think this is good and important because principles wisdom, is resistant to time and technology, but at least for myself, I was born in 1988, searching for practical wisdom has always remained elusive for me. I think difficult thing is that my circumstances were unique. I was born in the states, yet grew up poor; my definition of poor is not being sure whether you would be homeless next month because your dad just gambled away the rent money again, going off to Reno in the middle of the night. I think on two fronts this was useful to me: First, it taught me self independence at a very young age. I knew that if I wanted anything, I had to work for it. This motivated me to pick up lots of part-time jobs when I was like 13, 14 or 15, tutoring English, through my honors program at school, working at the local community center, getting a $200 a month stipend etc. ￼ In fact, my biggest personal pride and joy; essentially, purchasing my first car with my own money! At the age of 15, getting my drivers permit in California, $1000 or maybe $1200 1991 Sentra XE, 5 door sedan, 5 speed manual transmission car — it didn’t even have a tachometer! I learned how to shift gears simply by hearing and feeling the engine? This began my first love affair with manual transmission cars; In fact, another point of pride, every car I have purchased my own money has always been a used manual transmission car, never exceeding $2500 USD. In fact, the last car I purchased one in Providence Rhode Island before Seneca was born was a 2002 Subaru outback, five speed manual transmission, listed on craigslist for 1000 bucks, was able to negotiate down to $900, then $800 in cash! Lying out those eight $100 bills was the most obvious decision I’ve made in my life. ￼￼In terms of my decision-making philosophy, my unorthodox beliefs; obvious decisions are obvious. ￼ What that means is before making any sort of decision life decision etc., you don’t need to think about it too much. Obvious decisions are staring you right at the face, and whenever you have to hesitate before making a certain decision, don’t do it. Why? Your brain is still working out the details, whether or not you should do the thing or not. For example, buying microstrategy stock, MSTR, ￼￼to me is a 100% obvious decision. For the traditional markets, it’s literally the only asset worth purchasing. Why? Essentially they have discovered a free money hack or infinite money hack, which they could leverage their 30-year-old business, which is regulated, and mainstream… And leverage their position, borrowing money at less than one percent to buy bitcoin, which is accretive forever, and continuing the virtuous cycle. Bitcoin is cyber manhattan: 256^3￼ I think the idea of a cyber Manhattan, cyber real estate company is fascinating to me. And the difference between bitcoin, cyber real estate and Cyberman Manhattan is that it is actually backed by real electricity and power. For example, the problems with all these fake virtual worlds is that it is just powered by a computer code, one and zeros, Any nerd can click a button and create a skyscraper in Sim city. But what if, if you wanted to build a skyscraper in Sim city, you actually had to expand $1 billion of real capital in the real world, before transferring it and transporting it to cyberspace? This is the 1000% paradigm shift; The bridge between the physical, embodied reality, ￼ physical world and realm, to the digital cyber realm… Which is still backed with physical electricity? Or it’s a feature, not a bug? I think what a lot of these goody two shoers don’t get or understand is about real life physics in the game, skin in the game, energy in the game. Everyone wants some sort of hidden upside without any real life downside? I’ll give you example, everyone wants to rid the world of suffering pain injustice and the like. However, a life without suffering pain injustice and overcoming is not a life worth living. You cannot have happiness without pain and suffering, nor can you have joy with without sorrow and misery. If we think about this from a Taoist perspective, ￼I think about yin and Yang, you cannot have the good without the bad. You cannot have the virtuous without the evil. For example, obviously being in poor health sucks, and bad weather also sucks. But, when things get much better, you are 1000 times more joyful grateful and happy when things shift! This is why funny enough, I think people on the East Coast, New England, Providence Rhode Island are happier than people in LA because the weather shifts are more extreme. For example, when you’re suffering in the winter time for months on end, no sunshine whatever, and then boom, one day the sun comes out, everyone is overjoyed! It is still 55° and cold, but at least it is sunny; everyone runs out and gets their picnic blankets, And the joy of the sunlight is 1000 times more extreme than in Los Angeles where everyone is trying to hide from the sun, even though they love it? My simple analogy is everyone in LA is like a solid 7.2 out of 10, in terms of happiness, whereas in the East coast, your happiness goes from a -10 to a +500% when the weather is good! ￼ So I suppose, the philosophical question them becomes, is it better or more favorable to have a steady mediocre thing forever, or more extreme highs and lows, which will be a benefit to your happiness? Then a simple thought, the reason why I love bitcoin is because of the extremes; I would prefer an extreme life to a steady and boring one. ￼ I think for me my number one principle in investing ￼￼is yield. I think what a lot of people think is what they’re trying to do with their money is they are trying to securitize it, and make it safe, stored in really really safe assets like treasury bills, bonds, or “safe” investments like Apple Amazon Facebook Google and like. But, my personal thought is life should not be conservative; the point of life isn’t to just conserve your wealth, but rather, to grow it! Even the story of Jesus, you don’t just take your wealth and hide it and bury your talents, your gold talents in the ground because you’re afraid of losing it. No, the virtuous thing is to go out and multiply it! And I also think the same thing is with wealth; the virtuous calling is to multiply it to grow it, not to just bury it, with the fear that it might go down. OK, a lot of these fools, they want quick gains in order to go out and buy the Lamborghini or whatever. But once you find out that only small dick losers drive Lamborghinis, ￼ and also, that the useful lifetime value of a Lamborghini might only be three or four years, that is the point in which the maintenance costs and the insurance costs and fixing it up will destroy the price of it in just three or four years, then it becomes obvious; you wish the Lamborghini onto your worst enemy, you don’t desire one for yourself. ￼ My simple thought is take a stoic spartan approach; essentially live like a super super poor person, the only thing you should ever spend money on is weights barbells and weightlifting equipment, and meet… Everything else should be essentially free. This means, Essentially, the easiest way to become rich is not go broke.￼ So essentially, I’ve literally I think watch every single Michael Saylor interview that he’s ever done everything that he posted to Twitter or YouTube etc. Maybe about 100 of them. Anyways, probably the most fascinating thing that I’ve learned about the value of an asset is the value of an asset is essentially the cost of something or the value is something divided by the maintenance cost. Now I think this is something that people don’t really think about — ￼the maintenance cost. So for example, now that all of my millennial friends are growing up, I’m 36 now, in four years, I’m gonna be 40 years old, everyone’s trying to think about the future buying a single-family home or a condo or property or whatever. And what beguiles a lot of people or shocks people is when they buy a house, all the maintenance costs! Even talking to my friend Anton (congrats on your new kid!) he told me a story while we were in downtown LA about how he bought a house, but the water heater went out, and him having to fix it, and what a nightmare it was. Also simple things that we millennials never think about… You need a new roof and boom, that’s $50,000. That’s $50,000 I would rather put into bitcoin. There are so many things that exist on the planet, in real world, in embody reality which cost a premium in terms of insurance, maintenance, etc. Once again, almost nothing in the physical realm is ever worth it. ￼ If you want a new car, just download some racing game to your iPad, or even PlayStation or whatever; better to spend 50 bucks on a virtual car then drop $50,000 or more on a new one!￼ ￼ Or, just buy an oculus quest, play some racing game, at least this way you want to kill yourself, or another family in a car with two kids or more. –> The worst thing in life isn’t dying or killing yourself, but it is accidentally killing another family, accidentally killing kids in the car seat of another car, and you having to live with the guilt for the rest of your life. ￼￼ Bitcoin is not real, but, if it costs $800 billion to produce, it’s real! Let’s again, things must have a stake in the physical realm, if it doesn’t, it is just air coin, or the foundation is just built on cotton candy. I think we must avoid these fake environmentalists, a bunch of vegan losers. Essentially, if I psychoanalyze a lot of these fake environmentalists; essentially everyone is seeking a new religion, a new godhead which is the “environment“, but ultimately my critical thought is that once again it just comes down to money; For example, Al Gore, I wonder… How much money has he collected from doing his talks on an inconvenient truth, ultimately being funded by taxpayer money? And also, James Cameron, and also Arnold, how much money they have collected from the vegan pea protein powder plant factory, just follow the money. ￼ Much more profitable to sell a $50 container of vegan protein powder, than a meat company to sell beef rib or beef liver. ￼ Also a random aside; if you really wanted to be a real environmentalist, you would actually have a 100% organ meat diet, only beef heart beef liver beef kidneys and intestines, because these parts are typically thrown away. “Being naked is the ultimate sustainable option. We’re number two.” – Reformation marketing copy ￼ The truth is environmentalism is very profitable. For example a lot of these clothing companies, I think also like the new one “Reformation“, a female clothing company, they talk about sustainability and blah blah blah, but once again, is it just another marketing tactic to sell their mediocre clothes. For example, people talk that leather in animal products are evil blah blah blah. Yet the truth is, you’re cheap vegan leather jacket which is made out of petroleum is probably 1 trillion times worse for the planet than a fashionable one made out of 100% real leather. A pleather vegan jacket might only last you a few years, a good leather jacket can you last you 50 or beyond.￼ Because if you critically think about it, things which last, are better for the “environment”. And typically animal products last. I love leather!￼ Also nowadays, people talk about Native Americans and stuff like that, don’t you know that historically the way that natives lived off the land was in harmony with animals, like can you imagine a Native American who didn’t use animal power, ride on horses, or eat meat and bison? Besides maybe virtue signaling America, ￼there is no great civilization that has ever existed without animal products whether food labor etc. ￼ Once again I think the biggest issue is in today’s world, nobody likes risk anymore. Risk is seen as something which is dangerous bad and to be avoided. For example anybody who buys a Mercedes car an Audi, a Porsche a Lamborghini whatever… It is ultimately a risk free option in the sense that no one’s gonna make fun of you for owning those type of cars. So in some ways it is a cowardly act; For example everyone thinks a Porsche 911 is cool, a Lamborghini is cool, a Mercedes or an Audi is cool. Yet ￼ maybe I’m the only one with the big dick in the room, I brag that I drive a Toyota Prius? Everyone is always so shocked and impressed. Real investors and economists must and should drive a Prius! OK, whenever I discover anybody who’s a professor, who teaches in a business school, is an economist, academic or scholar or whatever… Yet just puts all of their money in a boring mutual fund… Or index fund… It is a signal that they are not a real economist, and they are actually not really connected to reality. We need some sort of risk exposure to the real world. For example, easy to be the typical fat American who is drinking beer or wine watching sports and American football, giving their opinion on sports teams and players yet they are not actually exposed to the risk of playing real tackle football? And once again… The more I think about it the more bizarre it is. To watch UFC or mixed martial arts, to watch any sport that you have not yourself played… It kind of like mental masturbation? To sports? Sports is masculine physical sports masturbation pornography? Just think about it the average person eats nachos french fries drink beer or alcohol smoke marijuana before watching the big game. But what a athlete who is actually participating in the sport down a beer really quick before putting on their armor and hitting the field? Obviously not! So why is it that alcohol food beverages is marketed to these individuals, for watching a sport? It is the new risk free premium hedonism; the joy of seeing people get murdered on a field, or in our arena without any real exposure. People are always so surprised that I played real football real American tackle football in high school, they are shocked to hear that I was linebacker, first outside linebacker then inside linebacker. ￼ I think it is actually racism; you never expect an Asian guy to play linebacker because we are not seen as masculine or aggressive enough. But if I were African-American or black, even though I am on the more lean side — you probably would not be shocked, because in America, athletes are always seen as being African-American, never Asian. Even an Asian professional sports athlete is almost seen as a glitch in the system, not the real deal. Even when first deadlifted 465 pounds, sumo style off the floor, and everyone was so shocked, I was talking to my friend Jemal and I asked him — “If I was African-American or black, but people will be asshocked or surprised?” He laughed and said no! So I think the first thing you have to think philosophically is what are you really searching for, and why? My very simple thought is think 300 years ahead, your kids kids kids. The current lifestyle is like the Persian slave lifestyle?￼ I think the issue we are facing today in today’s world is hedonism — the new hedonism. We seek companionship through humans or dogs, yet we don’t want to have children, we want to preserve our freedom travel the world go to Japan eat good sushi whatever. But, your dog cannot inherit your bitcoin. ￼￼ I think maybe in the past life was actually easier and more straightforward people. You got married, you built up a family legacy and empire; this was actually a pretty good strategy in life. And I think people were actually much happier, productive, and joyful! Think about all the modern day melodies of depression anxiety whatever, they are all modern day sociological ills. In fact, the ancient Greeks, thinking about the Iliad; certainly things are natural like courage, cowardice, and fear… But depression anxiety was not. My sociological theory on why so many people are so depressed and anxious is because of YouTube, Spotify, podcast, TikTok Facebook Instagram, Twitter, news, fear porn. ￼ Have a theory; a lot of people are secretly waiting and twiddling their thumbs, they actually want to see the world burn to the floor, to be able to have the indignant feeling; “I told you… I was right all along!” For example, all these people, are during Covid and pre-Covid and post Covid whatever, thought that there was gonna be food riots and blah blah blah, none of it happened. Humans are 1 trillion times more resilient than we make them out to be. ￼This is where also, philosophically I don’t really believe in short selling; even if you could cop a massive profit. For example there are certain things that I am certain which will go down to zero, like Ada Cardano and the like because it is fake. But rather than hoping that something is going to burn the floor, better to just bet on things that you think that will go to Mars! ￼ For example, everyone hates Elon Musk, and they are secretly waiting and plotting for him to fail. Yet doesn’t it take more courage to wish and hope and desire to see people succeed? Even I remember the Tesla model 3; everyone thought it would be impossible, but now, it is certainly the new Ford model T; the coolest, most desirable, most futuristic and affordable car on the road. I personally plan on driving my Toyota Prius until it dies at 1,000,000 miles, but if for one reason or another I was forced to purchase a brand new car, it would definitely be a Tesla, maybe the robotaxi? The reason why I encourage everyone to watch the Robo taxi, Robo van announcement is that it is the ultimate disruptor. For example, the Robo van, the two door coupe, insanely awesome design, with the butterfly McLaren doors… I find like there is no more reason to ever even want to buy a loser Lamborghini, or McLaren or whatever. And I really really love that rose gold, MATTE Rose gold Color on the Robo taxi, and also the rims look awesome! Once again, assuming that you’re a futurist like myself, the trillion dollar questions “why doesn’t the future actually look like the future?“ For example, if you really do believe in the digital transformation of things, like you care about Apple Tesla Amazon Facebook digital media whatever… Why would you ever buy analog property like a single-family home or whatever? Wouldn’t you prefer to buy digital property which is bitcoin? And also, issues with tax, property tax. Also assuming that you’re a libertarian, or some sort of anti-government person, bitcoin makes sense because it is like digital or cyber real estate that can’t be taxed! And I think the truth is that real rich people, know how to do tax deferment, or to avoid taxes, this is a real reason they become and stay rich. “My accountant so good I’m practically living tax-free!” – JAY Z￼￼￼ For example, even if you live in the lowest tax jurisdiction place which is Florida, and nobody wants to live in Florida, still… Under a base case scenario you’re still playing at least 1.1% in taxes. And that means then, the life of your asset is only 70 years; within 70 years Assuming you buy a $1 million property, you’re gonna pay $1 million in taxes in 70 years. Then, if you own a single-family home or whatever, or property the coal is actually trying to rent out your property at a premium, but two people who have never really had experience with property property management… It is a fucking nightmare and headache. Finding good tenants and keeping them; the holy Grail. Too much counterparty risk with properties; people who fuck up your property, end up not paying rent in squatting your place, people who start to grow marijuana inside your property, people who turn your property into a brothel (true story), or just physical wear and tear and decay. Anything in the physical realm in my opinion has too much risk. ￼And this is where still… In my eyes, Tesla is too much of a risk. Why? Having to build all those cyber trucks, Robo taxis, is just in my opinion, too much of a gargantuan physical task. Even if you automate the whole thing with robots, still, extracting lithium from the Earth, making the cars, delivering the cars, my personal estimate is you won’t see Robo taxis on the road for at least another five or seven years? To me that is too long. I think the best investment is something that you have a 100% certainty will go up in 30 years, and you just ignore the volatility and the noise on a day-to-day level. Yes especially if it is digital!￼ Also the funny thing is; bitcoin was the classic the first only immaculate conception; technically Ethereum from Vitalik was just a bitcoin copycat.￼ My very very basic suggestion is just download Coinbase to your phone, buy bitcoin from your traditional bank account, and once you’re done buying it, delete the Coinbase app from your phone, and never check prices. And what you doing instead it’s just go to michael.com, watch all the Michael sailor interviews, and read books on economic theory philosophy etc. I personally believe that the best wisdom is in the past; read Aristotle on economics, Fernandinho Galiani on money Della moneta, the principles of economic theory from Karl Menger etc. you should be able to find free PDFs of all these online, just read it on your iPad. ￼*** You buy the bitcoin, and you never sell it, just keep buying it until you die, and the idea is just give it to your kids kids kids. And you’re a supreme happiness and joy is through weightlifting, one red maxing, and seeing the numbers go up! ￼ My suggestion is never ever ever sell the bitcoin, for anything. If you need spare cash for living or whatever, better to borrow the money at 7% interest or lower, assuming that bitcoin is going to go up 21% year over a year, compounded rate forever. ￼ I would say only by microstrategy MSTR if you just cannot get access to capital to buy bitcoin directly. At the end of your life, he or she with the most bitcoin is going to be the winner. Or the corporate entity like micro strategy, who owns the most bitcoin. The goal is a Nakamoto, which is the mythical 1 million bitcoins. The same amount of bitcoins in Satoshi‘s wallet, which he hasn’t touched. ￼￼This is currently $60 billion! ￼ honestly because I live like a poor person, for me, at this point investing is just a new passion, almost like a new hobby. Still for me my critical passion is photography, blogging and like. ￼So the simple thought; know that investing in money is a means to an end not the in itself.

Title: My Favorite Tools For Working From Home

Zody II by Haworth Most people under invest in their office chair while working from home. It’s likely the most important piece of furniture that will determine how you feel physically and if ergonomic — will help you avoid things like future back pain. The best piece of advice I received was to always try a chair in person to make sure it’s the right fit for you. What I love about the Zody II by Haworth is that it’s the perfect cross between form and function. Because of back pain, my chiropractor recommends that I stand every 30 minutes which means I have to lift my desk to use it as a standing desk. The Zody II has a perch function (dual posture configuration) where you can raise it high enough and you can use the forward tilt feature which allows your seat to slope forward so you can extend your legs. Haworth has coined it forward tilt adjustment, if you ensure your configuration includes it you wont’ regret it. Additional ergonomic features include being able to adjust your seat depth and lumbar support. I’ve found myself adjusting the arm height frequently depending on if I’m actively typing or just listening in a Zoom meeting to take relief off my shoulders. Depending on preference, you can move the arms inward or outward which I often find myself adjusting as well. The Zody II includes other features which you’d expect in premium chair like easily adjusting the tension and seat height. What’s also fun is that you can customize things like color and fabric to truly make it your own. While the Zody II carries a premium price tag (which can depend on configuration), Haworth recently introduced the Breck chair which nails all ergonomic requirements without breaking the bank. Sitting in Breck feels responsive and you can adjust height and seat depth easily. They’ve designed the lumbar support to be easily adjusted and overall it’s more comfortable than most office chairs I’ve sat in over the years. Breck Office Chair Many companies provide an office stipend and if you can get your work to cover this expense it’s a great value for chair with a 12-year warranty for around $500. Purchasing can be a personal decision, like buying a mattress. Sometimes you need to try it out for a while or even a couple of visits to feel comfortable in your decision. As was told to me, try the chairs in person if you can as Haworth as a dealer locater available on their website. One of the most versatile pieces of furniture I’ve used comes from a company called Joybird. Buying nice furniture online can feel like a gamble, thankfully they have showrooms in major cities across the country. While it can naturally be used as a bedroom dresser, I prefer to use it as office storage in my living room. Fenton Chest What surprised me most was the quality of the Fenton Chest which is made with solid Acacia and engineered wood with walnut veneers. It feels well crafted and is made to last. It also arrived put together which is a huge plus. It’s also a nice touch that the top drawer is lined with a felt base. I solicited Gifty Walker, Director of Merchandising at Joybird, about what pieces of furniture people should consider when building their home office from scratch. “Since I personally need my home office to double as a guest room, I would first build around a sleeper sofa. My top picks are our Briar or Miller Sleeper Sofa. From there, I’d go with our Carver Desk. It’s the perfect size and it has drawers to keep things organized and out of sight for when you have guests over. To complete the room, I’d select the Monroe Floor Lamp that gives just the right amount of lighting for ambiance and video calls, while the machine washable Radha Rug helps tie your space together. Plus, the rug is a breeze to clean.” Gifty mentioned that storage is often one of the aspects often overlooked. She suggests considering a desk with built-in storage or a secondary furniture piece like a console cabinet to maximize space. I have a standing desk that has a small drawer so I can appreciate more storage especially within arms reach. While Joybird is rooted in Mid-Century style and bold colors, they’ve adapted to color trends like whites and neutral palettes. Another strong differentiator is that Joybird actually manufactures all of their customizable upholstery pieces. You can see their unique design embedded into much of their furniture pieces as they cover everything from home office to dining room and even decor pieces. “Where does the inspiration come from?” I asked. “When it comes to interior design, inspiration can be found anywhere. We spend time at trade and design shows that give us glimpses into what’s coming. Since design is not solely about aesthetics, but it is also about function and utility, we may see something that could be amazing but not resonate with our customer so we’ll modify based on what customers have shown interest in through sales. Interior trends and colors specifically often follow the fashion industry so we will keep a pulse on that. Other great sources are architecture design and nature. Think about the doorway arches and now we’ve seen that become a trend when it comes to rounded edges over clean and sharp corners. Green is often a top design color because it provides the same calming effects of being in nature,” Gifty explained. Perhaps my biggest takeaway from Gifty is that we often have to think about multi-functional spaces instead of the traditional dedicated office with traditional furniture. She said this shows up as a guest room and office combination and we need the right pieces like a sleeper sofa to fit the room’s needs from day to night. It’s a great reminder to question furniture purchases with function in mind. One of the significant changes I’ve made is my wardrobe. I don’t want to wear jeans at home because they’re not exactly comfortable, but I also don’t feel the best version of myself when I’m wearing sweatpants while I’m working. Men's Everywhere Pant Cozy Earth is widely known for their super soft bedding and they’ve extended their line into clothing. The Men’s Everywhere Pant is just that — I can wear them all day at work and run out for errands while being comfortable and never feeling like I have to change. They pair nicely with their Everyday Polo and unlike every other polo I’ve owned they don’t shrink after washing them (ideally cold water and hang drying). Working from home has motivated me to cook more. I’ve picked up the hobby of batch juicing and even bake bread for the family. I’ve used Caraway pots and pans for a few years and naturally learning how to use stainless steel was my next step as it’s generally a safe option to avoid toxins in your food. However, there is a bit of a learning curve. Stainless Steel Cookware Set You can be captivated by the colors and appearance of the Caraway lineup and I’ve found their Stainless Steel Cookware Set to deliver on that same promise. Stainless steel is designed to have more heat retention than non-stick pans. When used properly, your food should not stick to the pan. One of my favorite Caraway pieces is their dutch oven. As you may know, not all dutch ovens are created equal because the way one cooks may be slightly different from another. I’ve made braised short ribs thanks to YouTube chef Alison Roman to perfection with their dutch oven. Their stainless steel set, however, comes generously with four pieces and a nicely sized 10.5’’ frying pan which I find myself using most often — especially to make a quick and healthy piece of salmon. The pan storage unit it comes with has been very helpful for organization and since they’re stacked horizontally it prevents them from scratching one another. While it’s an investment in the stainless steel set, it seems built to last like my previous Caraway set. Over the last few years I’ve continued to tweak and optimize my home office and desk setup. There are two lights I’ve come across that have been very unique and could be useful depending on your needs. As someone who has a standing desk and attempts to minimize clutter in my office space, I have numerous mounts from Elgato that have been invaluable. The mounts themselves have eliminated the need for two tripods around my desk. I also used to have a key light which was my main source of light on myself along with a massive light box hanging above my desk. It’s a big space commitment for this type of lighting and it doesn’t look conducive if you’re trying to use the space for other things. Elgato Key Light Air Elgato makes a number of light sources, but what I like about their Key Light Air is that it’s an edge-lit LED panel with a small footprint that packs a big punch in terms of lighting. They come with very solid stands, but once again I use their Master Mount L to clamp both lights at the edges of my desk. I was skeptical about how much light these would produce, given their name “Air” and comparing them to the other models with larger LED panels. However, I can tell you I often have them in the 5-10% range of brightness and it’s plenty lit. The one thing to note is that they are controlled through the Elgato app. That means after pairing the lights you have to use the app to turn them on or change the brightness and color temperature. I haven’t had any major issues and it seems to work well most of the time. Once in a blue moon it will take an app refresh for both lights to connect. They have an on and off switch behind the panel, but it would be a nice touch if you could modify the brightness with a physical button. Just something to consider if you feel like you prefer a physical switch on a light. Dyson’s floor lamp is called the Solarcycle Morph and it definitely looks like something out of this world. There are many things that are unique about it but one of the benefits I appreciate is that is serves a dual purpose. You can extend the light out to shine directly or you can magnetically snap the light back into the tall cylinder and it creates an ambient light. The ambient light is perfect for reading, relaxing, and it’s the perfect lighting for the background of a Zoom call. Dyson Solarcycle Morph The Solarcycle has physical buttons and you can control the same settings through the Dyson app. The light also has a USB-C charging port on bottom, a feature I have not used often but it’s a convenience for some. Dyson offers a desktop model but I prefer the floor lamp if you have the space for it. Dyson is widely known for their vacuums and other beautifully designed items like cooling fans. One thing that’s important to me is saving space. They have a product that acts as both a cooling system, heater, and an air purifier called the Purifier Hot+Cool Formaldehyde purifying fan heater. It’s a mouthful but deservedly so because it has three functions in one so I don’t need a fan, space heater, and air purifier. While I have all of those products separately, I’ve been able to put them in storage for now. The same Dyson app will pair with both the light and the purifying fan heater which is convenient. I mentioned batch juicing. One of the staples in my kitchen over the last year has been the Nama J2 juicer. It’s newest addition, the J3, is equally impressive. J3 Cold Press Juicer Because of the chambers that slow juice, it saves time because you can cut fruits and vegetables as you go and then put them inside. If you have children who like to help, it makes juicing fun because they get to watch the fruits swirl around as they begin to go down the chamber. Cleaning up takes about five minutes as you should hand wash and dry when you can to avoid any stains on the juicer itself. While I’ve made many batches of juice with it’s predecessor, the J3 yields about 16 oz of juice which is half as much as the J2. It also has a smaller sized base which makes it a great option for apartment living or if you like to travel with your juicer. If you plan to drink your juice right away it might make sense to consider J3. Performance wise they have the same motor (50 rpm). One thing I’d recommend, whether you use a Nama juicer or an alternative — find at least one recipe book that will inspire you to try new recipes. I typically make two juices per week. One being the green juice staple, and the other will either will be a rotating recipe or something completely new depending on what’s in season. As you cook more in the kitchen you have a need for different types of knives. As an adult, the only real knife I purchased was a Togiharu from Blue Apron that I broke in half inside of a watermelon. It was probably my fault, however, there are two brothers — Jared and Jordan, who have reinvented this houseware category. So much so that I can’t take a trip Costco without noticing one of their beautiful sets of knives. Cutlery Knife Set Admittedly, I’ve also bought knives that come in a pack of three from Bed Bath & Beyond and they ended up in the garbage within a few months. These knives are built to last as they’re made with German stainless steel. I always hand wash them and try to dry them right away and the condition of them remains outstanding. You can invest $150 in a set of knives that will probably last you at least a decade or more. The sets typically come with a small manual that tells you exactly what each knife is for — and honestly I’ve misplaced mine. Nonetheless — the chef’s knife works flawlessly. The bread knife works as advertised, and whether you’re cutting through a watermelon or a steak you’ll feel like you’re using a thousand dollar knife. What’s nice about their knife blocks is that you can keep them up and away from the kids rather than having them easily accessible in a drawer. I highly recommend it if you have little ones roaming around the kitchen. Another office solution that I wish I discovered years ago is the combination of the monitor arm by Humanscale along with their M/Connect 3 and Pro Dock. It’s given my desk plenty more room because I can put away my clunky stand that came with my Lenovo monitor. The arm is one of the most ergonomic inventions on the market. I used to use one from Fully (now Herman Miller) — but the Humanscale design and functionality makes it the iPhone of monitor arms. It’s beautiful and minimalistic. I also use my monitor as a movie screen and I can easier bring it forward with no hassle. What’s even more interesting is the hub on bottom. One of the biggest issues with a monitor that is also designed as a docking station is that all of your wires and connections hang from the monitor. I have an 8-inch hub literally hanging off the side of my monitor which is an eye sore. M/Connect 3 with monitor arm Taking a look under the hood, there’s an actual dock that sits below your desk — out of sight. In other words, you get the benefits of the minimalistic space saving design with the additional USB and USB-C charging ports, as well as the entire hub clamped under your desk (see below). M/Connect 3 with Pro Dock Unless you need your monitor stand and have a docking solution you’re in love with, I can’t think of a cleaner and more efficient setup. I know many people like to have a dual monitor, so you can pick and choose which type of monitor arm makes the most sense for you. You can also decide on three colors in terms of the Pro Dock that suites your color scheme. My standing desk has white legs so I prefer the white dock. Set aside 30 minutes to setup your monitor arm and docking station and you should be in business. Humanscale’s Vice President of Product Management, Mark Consolla, shared how your home office setup can support your overall health and productivity. "An ergonomic home office setup is essential for maximizing both your health and productivity. With more people working remotely, it's critical that workstations at the home are designed to support comfort and well-being. Our M2.1 monitor arm, with its easy-to-assemble and dynamically configurable design, helps users achieve an optimal ergonomic position, reducing strain and promoting better posture throughout the day. By investing in tools like the M2.1, professionals can enhance both their efficiency and their long-term health wherever they work." One of the tech gadgets I’ve found myself using most over the last few months is a device from Courant called the MAG:2 Classics. Essentially, it magnetically connects to my iPhone and serves a dual purpose. It’s a charger and a phone stand in one — as well as having a place to charge your AirPods on the base as well. I’m a fan of the brown leather look while they also have a linen option. MAG:2 Classics I find myself carrying it around with me much of the day. It’ll be at my desk when I’m working. In the kitchen if I’m cooking or washing dishes so I can watch YouTube clips. I’ve also used it to play workout videos because it serves as the perfect stand. It has a non-slip construction so you can use it almost anywhere. MAG:3 Classics Courant also makes a charging catch trays, one which they’ve coined the MAG:3 Classics. It has the MagSafe capability so your iPhone and AirPods will connect and charge very easily. I have it by my bedside and use it daily. I also don’t want to scratch the wood on my nightstand which is another reason why I keep it there for protection. One of the staples for any office space is an area rug, unless you’re in a carpeted room of course. Ensuring that you have a run on hardwood floors will also help with your sound quality as you want furniture and things to fill the room to avoid an echo. I searched high and low for a contemporary rug that’s easy to clean and I kept coming across a company called Revival. Their Shell rug was exactly what I was looking for. It’s very soft on your feet and easy to vacuum. Some rugs are insanely heavy. This was folded and packaged nicely, and it was light enough for me to carry around by myself. This specific rug comes in 4 color and 11 different sizing options. Always be sure to have a rug pad underneath because it will feel nicer and provide your rug with longevity. Shell washable rug I solicited Ben Hyman, co-founder and CEO of Revival about the inspiration behind the Shell rug. “We wanted to make a machine-washable rug that didn’t read as washable, but instead looked and felt as thick and soft as a standard hand-knotted rug. It was important to us to use recycled materials. The look of the collection was inspired by the accidental designs you find on the beach, made by waves on sand.” Revival is most known at the intersection between quality, design, variety, and affordability. However, buying a rug online is difficult. While it’s not exactly like buying a mattress — people often want to see and experience the rug in person before making the commitment. I asked Hyman how they’ve tried to make that experience more seamless for the customer. “Since the beginning we’ve invested heavily in our photography and descriptions to make sure we’re conveying all the important details about each rug. We have impeccable customer service, well-designed boxes, free shipping, complimentary interior design consultations, an augmented reality tool that lets you view your rug in your room, and a swatch program, so you can order samples of our bestselling rugs before you buy. We’re also constantly investing in the digital user experience on our website so that the experience feels intuitive and snappy. Collectively, these features make Revival a special place to shop.” Some people prefer a wool rug but they’re often very expensive. Typically, you have to take them to a rug cleaner which you have to take into consideration when it comes to the lifetime cost of the rug. Hyman and his global team have leveraged having a presence in places like Casablanca and Istanbul because it gives them access to local artisans. They’ve also somehow made wool rugs that are washable. “We’re proud of the R&D we’ve done around rug utility and sustainability, without compromising design. This focus on construction and materiality has resulted in products like our washable wool Lino and Helen rugs.” The team at Revival has kept their pulse on the market over the last few years, adapting to the needs of customers. “We started off as a purveyor of vintage rugs, a small niche within the much broader rug category. Early on we realized we needed to find a way to offer customers more than vintage; that it was important they have access to a wider range of time periods, including contemporary. Within a few years of producing new rugs it became clear customers were looking for washables, which has become a huge part of our business. it’s been a gradual evolution,” Hyman explained. While the pandemic wasn’t exactly an accelerator like it was for many e-commerce companies — there was a silver living for the team at Revival. “In 2020 we launched items like other textiles and furniture on the site. Yet we struggled to find our footing from both an operational and marketing perspective in these other categories, as we spread our small team too thin. In 2022 we came full circle, pivoting back to a more exclusive focus on rugs, and expanding our offering further in that category. This additional focus on high-quality, affordable rugs sets us apart; it took a while – and some missteps – to get there.” This led to them eventually establishing a significant inventory in the US so that stock issues wouldn’t hold them back, and rugs could ship out to their customers in 2-3 days. As we concluded our interview, I solicited Hyman for the best piece of advice he’d give someone shopping for a rug. “First — measure your room. Second — buy a rug pad. These two surprisingly simple things will make a huge difference in how good your rug looks.” One of the habits I’ve broken (in a good way) is buying coffee out and it’s saved a lot of money. I typically make tea at home but one thing that becomes frustrating is that my tea is either too hot or too cold. Enter the Ember Mug 2. Ember Mug 2 To admit, I was skeptical at first. However, when I keep the tea temperature at 145 degrees it’s just right — and the Mug 2 can keep that temperature for 80 minutes off the charger. The temperature can be controlled through their app and the design and color options are sleek. I do wish, however, they made an even larger option than 14 oz. It’s definitely big enough to function well but I am a fan of large mugs. I’ve also found and tested a $13 mug warmer from a local grocery store and it did the job, but you have to keep it on your desk or within reach. That’s a nice touch with the Mug 2 is that you can keep the charger in the kitchen and not have to worry about more clutter on your desk. I’m often looking for ways to save time and one tool that’s been helpful is the robotic pool cleaner by Polaris, specifically the FREEDOM Plus model. FREEDOM Plus Overall, using a robotic cleaner has saved me nearly 8 hours per month of manually scrubbing the pool and I don’t get the lactic acid and soreness built up in my shoulders and arms. Also, robotic cleaners use less energy because you don’t have to rely on the pool’s filtration system as often. I appreciated how lightweight thee FREEDOM Plus is because it makes it very portable. The inclusion of a charger stand with wheels makes it even more portable and convenient. The cordless feature is a notable advantage, as it eliminates the risk of entanglement and allows for uninterrupted use of the pool while the device is operational. This is a substantial improvement over traditional corded pool cleaners, which can be cumbersome and restrictive. While most robotic cleaners come with a hefty price tag it’s definitely worth exploring so you can save more time and invest that elsewhere. An important tip I learned from a course I took on setting up a home studio is the importance of plants in your Zoom background. It plays a significant role in how people perceive your office. One of the keys is to use artificial plants because you will always have a consistent look compared to a real plant that changes shape every so often. One of the biggest drawbacks to real plants is that there is often more work involved than meets the eye. You can’t just “set it and forget it.” Most plants need to be in sunlight and if they have issues you have to troubleshoot the humidity in your office and a plethora of other things that become more work. If you are a plant enthusiast that is another story. Artificial Fiddle Leaf Fig Tree with Artisan Planter CG Hunter is a company who makes artificial plants and trees. I’ve traversed every craft store that carries artificial plants and CG Hunter’s quality is in another stratosphere. I initially came across some of their trees at Costco was floored because I thought they were real. What are the benefits of an artificial tree versus a real one? I asked an executive at CG Hunter. “Faux plants and trees bring the beauty of nature into the home or office without the maintenance. They provide the lush vibrancy of real plants without the need for watering or sunlight, making them perfect for spaces with low light. With their low maintenance and long-lasting durability, they offer a cost-effective way to enhance any space without the need for ongoing care. Artificial plants are also pet friendly.” I solicited them for any additional considerations. “It is important to consider scale when buying faux trees as you want to use them to deliver height or fullness and dimension as well as texture, color, and pattern. Carefully selected faux trees and plants can be used to hide unsightly plugs or cords other blemishes in a room.” It’s so true. If you use a standing desk, you want to be mindful about how your plants and trees are visible in the background depending on whether you sit or stand. My chiropractor recommended I stand every 30 minutes — so I’m always keeping that in mind. For example, if my plant is too short and I lift my desk then it may be out of sight. I’ve found it helpful to turn on a Zoom meeting, setup your background, and look at your monitor to see what the other people would see. One other pro tip is to have the plan partially in your shot because it makes the length and size of the room feel larger than it may be in real life. close up of Fiddle Leaf Fig Tree One thing I like about the Fiddle Leaf Fig Tree (pictured above) is the thickness of the leaves. If you are using a high quality web cam or a mirrorless camera for Zoom, you want to have a slight blur in the background. Not the kind of blur Zoom offers because your room is messy — I mean the slight blur that you see on a quality video podcast. Thicker greenery will often pop in your picture. As you can see the texture of the trees from CG Hunter truly come alive. Most importantly you have to test things out in your environment and see what works for you based on what look you are trying to achieve. Lastly, one of my favorite items that I’ve used to and from the office and coffee shops is my Briggs & Riley backpack. What I love most about it is that it doesn’t slouch over like most brands. You can sit it on the floor or next to your desk and it keeps shape. The design is thoughtful and intentional, and it has every compartment you would need — even for a quick flight. It always serves as my carry-on when I travel. Medium Cargo Backpack Like their timeless luggage, the backpack just works and it matches just about any wardrobe. What also makes Briggs & Riley stand out is their customer service. I’ve had luggage have issues in the past because the airline slammed them during transport and Briggs & Riley has fixed them with their lifetime warranty. They’ve also nailed the intersection of quality and price with unique products that last a liftetime. My previous favorite shoe that was easy to put on and incredibly comfortable was the Hupana Flow by HOKA. While they have discontinued the model, what I like about the Transport shoe is that have the quick-toggle laces where you don’t have to tie your shoes. You can just pull up the tongue and slip your feet in and go. HOKA is widely known for making the most comfortable shoes and this model delivers on that promise. Men's Transport shoe in Alabaster / Varsity Navy They’re also treated with a topical water repellent agent that make them a go-to for light drizzle. What I’ve found is that the further you go towards a rainboot, the less comfortable shoes can be. The Vibram outsole, which can be found on other models, makes it especially nice for the elements. So far these have been very comfortable and I’m glad they come in a wide option. Personally, I like to limit clutter around the front door so there are usually two pairs of shoes there. One for working out and another for running errands. I probably won’t throw away my Hupanas until there are more holes in them, but I’m optimistic the Transports will replace them in the near future.

Leading today’s Green Deals is an exclusive discount on Anker’s latest SOLIX C300 DC 90,000mAh/288Wh Portable Power Station that drops costs to a new $148 low price while also giving you some free gear. Next, we spotted Samsung’s AI-supported Bespoke All-in-One Electric Washer & Ventless Heat Pump Dryer starting from its $1,800 Best Buy low, with some additional chances to save. We have two great Greenworks deals – one on the 40V 20-inch Cordless Electric Push Mower that just hit a new $304 Amazon low, with a more advanced combo bundle that gets you a mower, blower, and string trimmer. Bringing up the rear is a one-day-only discount on GoTrax’s Z4 LITE Folding e-bike that has dropped it back to a $600 low. Plus, all the other hangover Green Deals in the links at the bottom of the page, like yesterday’s coverage of the latest sales on Velotric’s e-bikes and NIU’s KQi e-scooters, and more. Head below for other New Green Deals we’ve found today and, of course, Electrek’s best EV buying and leasing deals. Also, check out the new Electrek Tesla Shop for the best deals on Tesla accessories. We’ve got an exclusive chance for 9to5Toys readers to save more money than before on Anker’s newest SOLIX C300 DC 90,000mAh Portable Power Station while getting some free gear all for $148 shipped, after using the promo code 9TO5PBANK26. Down from a $200 price tag, we’ve already seen a few discounts for this unit since it first hit the market in August, with the biggest of them being its $150 launch price which we just saw repeat for the first time at the tail-end of last month. It’s getting beaten out here today though, as this promotion gives you a slightly bigger 26% markdown that saves you $52 and sets a new all-time low price. Not only does it beat out Anker and Amazon’s current markdowns to $180, but it also comes with a free USB-C charging cable as well as a carrying strap which hasn’t been offered with the station since its early-bird launch special. Anker’s SOLIX C300 DC power station arrives in a compact 90,000mAh/288Wh unit that easily stores away inside your bag, delivering up to 300W of power output for your more personal devices. This model boasts the first of Anker’s inclusions of boosted recharging speeds that you can take advantage of by using its two bidirectional 140W USB-C ports at the same time for up to 280W speeds. There’s also the bonus option of recharging its battery via a 100W solar panel that refills it in 3.2 hours. You’ll have a solid variety of output connection options with its four USB-C ports (a 15W port, a 100W port, and the two 140W ports), two 12W USB-A ports, and a 120W auxiliary port. Taking a note from its predecessor, the 60,000mAh PowerCore Reserve, Anker has continued the trend of including an integrated pop-up LED light in the C300 DC power station that provides three different brightness levels that can be used as a camping lantern or emergency light source. While you can monitor and adjust settings through the companion app via a Bluetooth connection to your smartphone, it also provides readouts on its display too. Best Buy is having a Samsung savings event through October 20 that is cutting costs on a lineup of Samsung devices and appliances to update and upgrade your home life, with the brand’s Bespoke AI 5.3 Cubic-Foot All-in-One Electric Washer & Ventless Heat Pump Dryer down at $1,799.99 shipped. Normally going for $2,800 at Best Buy, with a greater $3,324 price tag direct from Samsung, we saw it fall to its lowest rate back in June when Costco offered a short-lived markdown to $1,600, while Best Buy last saw its $1,800 low during Labor Day sales. It’s returning here today though, offering up $1,000 in savings while also offering $50 rewards for My Best Buy Plus and Total members. Bargain hunters can also save an additional $278 when buying this model in excellent open-box condition. One thing to note before we dive into its capabilities is that Samsung has this washer & dryer currently marked down to $1,999 shipped, with its open-box option being slightly higher than Best Buy’s at $1,599 (click the “add” box to the side), which does balance out the differences in cost with a few added benefits with either purchase. First, you’ll get two years of Samsung Care+ for just $1 over its usual $149 price on top of getting free installation too. This ENERGY STAR-certified all-in-one washer & dryer arrives AI-supported for less time consuming and easier managed laundry routines that you don’t have to babysit. The AI programming in this model lets the unit detect different fabric types and adjust its own settings in response to their soil levels. Its detergent tank has been given a larger capacity than we often see in these appliances, holding up to 47 loads worth of detergent before needing a refill – plus, its Flex One compartment takes the convenience to the next level as it can be split between 25 loads of detergent and 34 loads of softener. As is the case with models in the green category, we cannot gloss over the biggest design feature here: its ventless heat pump design. Not only does it allow you to rethink its placement in your home (as it doesn’t need to go where the one vent is located like standard models and plugs into a standard wall outlet), but its dual-inverter heat pump tech also significantly increases energy efficiency while working in conjunction with the AI system to calculate and predict your electricity costs to “reduce energy usage by up to 19%.” It’s also been given self-cleaning and self-drying tech to keep laundry coming out fresh, smart controls via the SmartThings app (as well as hands-free voice controls too), the EPA’s seal of approval, and much more. Head below to learn about the rest of what this appliance can bring to your home. Be sure to check out the entire lineup of Samsung appliances and devices that are benefitting from Best Buy’s sale, like tablets, TVs, PCs, laptops, monitors, and more that we covered when it first launched. You can also check out the direct offers from Samsung here. The colder months may be setting in on us, but lawns still need to be kept up and deals can often be better in these fall and winter months. Amazon is following this line of thinking as it offers the Greenworks 40V 20-inch Cordless Electric Push Mower for $303.98 shipped. Usually goes for $400, which isn’t too bad of a starting price for an electric mower (compared to some of the bigger high-end models). We’ve seen a few discounts over 2024 that bring costs down even lower, most repeating the same drop to the former $320 Amazon low, but today those rates are beaten out by this even greater 24% markdown that takes $96 off the price tag and lands it at a new Amazon low. Powered by the included 4.0Ah battery, this Greenworks mower’s 40V brushless motor delivers a nice uniform cut for yards up to 1/3 acre in size after one round of charging. Everything is housed within a 20-inch steel deck crowned by LED headlights for those early morning and late evening jobs, while the folding handles “saves 70% more space in seconds with vertical storage.” There are seven different cutting height levels to choose from here, as well as a 4-in-1 design that does the usual mulching, side discharging, or rear-bagging for your grass clippings on top of a turbo leaf pickup setting for a bit more versatile use. Of course, you’ll never have to struggle with a pull string here either, as it has been given a convenient push-button start to compliment its electric functionality. For folks looking to expand their lawn care arsenal beyond just a mower, Amazon is also currently offering a Greenworks bundle of an 80V 21-inch Self-Propelled Cordless Electric Lawn Mower, an Axial Leaf Blower, and a 16-inch String Trimmer at its lowest price of $630, down from $900. You’re getting a more advanced mower here that offers most of the same features as the above model, trading its turbo leaf pickup for an improved self-propulsion system alongside a greater runtime that can tackle yards up to 1/2 an acre. There’s also the Axial leaf blower that hits 580 CFM for yard-clearing power with a turbo mode and even cruise control locks, as well as the attachment-capable string trimmer with a bump feed head, variable speed control, and a load n’ go spool for faster and easier re-spooling. Courtesy of its Deals of the Day, Best Buy is offering the GoTrax Z4 LITE Folding e-bike for $599.99 shipped for the rest of the day. Normally priced at $900, we’ve seen it listed at higher rates between $900 and $1,100 from other third-party retailers. We’ve seen a few of these one-day discounts drop costs on this entry-level model, first to $650 at the start of summer, and then some repeated falls to $600 in July and August. After a lull on price cuts until now, this is a chance to save yourself $300 while also grabbing this commuting solution at the lowest price we have tracked. The GoTrax Z4 LITE e-bike makes a great first-time choice for riders looking to enter the e-bike world without dropping serious cash right away, delivering 20 MPH top speeds and an impressive traveling distance of up to 40 miles on a single charge (25 miles when you only use the throttle). The triple-folding frame design houses the 350W motor and the removable 48V battery while providing easier storage and transport options when not in use. It also comes along with 20-inch fat tires, dual front and rear braking, an integrated headlight and taillight that provides brake light functionality, a rear cargo rack, a kickstand, and a digital display. The savings this week are also continuing to a collection of other markdowns. To the same tune as the offers above, these all help you take a more energy-conscious approach to your routine. Winter means you can lock in even better off-season price cuts on electric tools for the lawn while saving on EVs and tons of other gear. FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More.

Title: ‘We like getting the variety boxes of chips at Sam’s and Costco’: Shopper shares hack to make your own variety box of Frito-Lay chips
URL: https://www.dailydot.com/news/frito-lay-custom-variety-pack/
Time Published: 2024-10-16T01:00:00Z

Melody Heald Some life hacks are just game-changing. Like this more efficient way to grate cheese. Or how to get a new tire for free. A customer thinks she just discovered one of these game-changing hacks while shopping online at Frito-Lay. “All right, tell me if this was a thing because up until a few days ago, I did not [know about this],” TikTok user Sammie (@sammie.sells) starts in her video. Sammie continues, explaining she and her family buy the variety boxes of chips at Sam’s Club and Costco. “But I always feel like we don’t always eat all the Cheetos. We don’t always eat all the Fritos. Like, we can never find a good mix of them,” she says. She came across a solution to this problem. “Did you know you can make your own box on the Frito-Lay website?” the content creator asks. Sammie flips the camera, showing off the box of chips she customized. “Look at this! I got to pick all of them out. None of this will go to waste because we will eat all this,” she says. Normally, a 30-chip variety pack is $20 at Sam’s Club. Ordering a custom variety pack online does a little extra. But for Sammie, those extra bucks are worth it. “It’s, like, $25 with shipping. It got here in three days,” she says. “I’m never buying chips from Sam’s or Costco again,” she concludes. The Daily Dot reached out to Sammie via TikTok comment and direct message. Her video has amassed 1.3 million views. Consequently, after watching Sammie’s video, some viewers rushed to the Frito-Lay website. Others said the price of the customizable box just wasn’t worth it for them. “How I need to try this,” one stated. “This is amazing if I’m able to order what I like.” “Raise your hand if you just learned you don’t have ‘build your own potato chip box’ money,” a second remarked. “Yep…but the cost is crazy compared to the grocery store,” a third shared. In a follow-up video, Sammie demonstrates how to order your own variety box through. First, she clicks on “snacks.com.” “You’re gonna click on the link, and it’ll take you here,” she says. “This screen will have all the chips that are in stock. You can put all the same ones or make it a variety pack.” After the content creator selects her 30, she scrolls to the bottom, and hits “view box,” “add to cart,” and “proceed to checkout.” Sammie also addresses viewer concerns about the cost of the product. “I understand it’s not cheaper. My whole thing is it gives me the chips that I want, and none of them go to waste,” she clarifies. In 2020, Frito-Lay gave customers the ability to create their own variety packs after discovering that two out of three customers were willing to pay for it. “Since we launched Snacks.com earlier this year, we’ve seen it resonate with consumers, and our team has uncovered insights to continue giving our consumers more of what they want,” Michael Lindsey, Chief Transformation and Strategy Officer, Frito-Lay North America said on the company’s website. “Our ability to own the end-to-end value chain enables us to deliver customized offerings like ‘Make Your Own Variety Pack’ to create a more personalized snacking experience.” The Daily Dot reached out to Frito-Lay via email.

Walgreens plans to close about 1,200 stores over the next three years in an effort to improve earnings and increase cash flow, the struggling company announced Tuesday. The downsizing plan by Walgreens Boots Alliance will target 500 stores during the current fiscal year, which began on Sept. 1, and comes months after Chief Executive Tim Wentworth acknowledged that about a quarter of the company’s 8,600 U.S. stores were underperforming. The company did not specify which stores will close but said it will prioritize underperforming locations owned by the company or at which the lease is expiring. Only stores in the U.S. will be affected. Walgreens Boots Alliance also owns the Boots pharmacy chain in the United Kingdom. Wentworth told analysts Tuesday that about 6,000 Walgreens locations remain profitable, according to the Associated Press. The company operates more than 580 stores in California, second only to Florida. The closures announced Tuesday include 300 already approved under a previous cost-cutting plan. Walgreens is not alone in its woes — competitors Rite Aid and CVS have also been forced to reconsider their footprints and close locations amid challenging times for the industry. Rite Aid has closed more than 200 stores since filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2023. Read more: 'My kids go to Costco now,' and other reasons Rite Aid, Walgreens and CVS are hurting On the retail side, chain pharmacies are facing heavy competition from giants such as Amazon and Walmart, while a drop in consumer spending and an increase in theft have continued to eat into profits, analysts said. On the pharmaceutical side, they’re seeing tighter margins because of lower reimbursement rates for the drugs they sell to customers. Much of the pharmacy pinch is rooted in the companies’ dependence on intermediaries called pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, that have significant control over how much pharmacies get reimbursed for the drugs they sell to customers. Two of the largest benefit management companies, OptumRX and Caremark, are owned by insurance companies that have been looking to cut costs by pushing down reimbursement rates, which has punished the pharmacies’ bottom lines. Chain pharmacies are also operating in an overcrowded environment, said Raymond James healthcare analyst John Ransom. Partly because of a real estate binge in the 1990s, urban communities are dotted with an excess of pharmacies, he said. “Like most retailers, we have been facing a challenging operating environment,” Walgreens external communications manager Samantha Stansberry said in August. “These factors have resulted in a growing number of store closures across the country as we invest in our other locations to deliver a consistent customer experience.” Read more: Walgreens woes continue with earnings miss, guidance cut and plans to shutter more stores The plan to close stores was announced as part of the company's release of its fourth-quarter and end-of-year financial reports, which underscored its dire straits. For fiscal year 2024, which ended Aug. 31, Walgreens posted a net loss of $8.6 billion, up 180% from the previous year. Total revenue for the company rose about 6% for the year to $147.7 billion. Investors reacted positively to Walgreens' cost-saving strategy, driving up shares in the company nearly 16% on Tuesday to $10.42. The rise, however, still left the stock down more than 61% so far this year. “Fiscal 2025 will be an important rebasing year as we advance our strategy to drive value creation,” Wentworth said in a news release detailing fourth-quarter and full-year financial results. “This turnaround will take time, but we are confident it will yield significant financial and consumer benefits over the long term.” Sign up for our Wide Shot newsletter to get the latest entertainment business news, analysis and insights.

Title: The Quiet Trump-Harris Trade Agreement

On chickens, cute trucks, semiconductor chips, and bananas Subscribe here: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | Overcast | Pocket Casts After former President Donald Trump’s surprise victory in 2016, his administration imposed several rounds of tariffs on China on everything from washing machines to steel. The move was described by the nonpartisan conservative organization the Tax Foundation as one of the “largest tax increases in decades.” And yet, protectionist economic thinking has since gained traction in both parties. In a rare instance of agreement, President Joe Biden retained most of his predecessor’s tariffs—and imposed even more earlier this year. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen described her own evolution on this topic succinctly: “People like me grew up with the view: If people send you cheap goods, you should send a thank-you note. That’s what standard economics basically says … I would never, ever again say, ‘Send a thank-you note.’” Essentially, Yellen used to think that if China wanted to flood the United States with cheap goods, why complain? Well, now she appears more concerned about the cost of all those cheap goods to the nation’s domestic manufacturing base. On today’s episode of Good on Paper, I’m joined by the Cato Institute’s vice president of general economics, Scott Lincicome, to examine this popular narrative—one that he doesn’t put much stock in, largely because the high cost of tariffs are disproportionately borne by poorer people, but also because of the political dysfunction they sow: “The economics of trade are counterintuitive,” Lincicome explains. “And so tariff policy is notoriously corrupt. And so there’s a lot of political dysfunction, along with just hiring all those lobbyists to get special tariffs or special exemptions. But also, it’s just a very politically perilous policy.” The following is a transcript of the episode: [Music] Jerusalem Demsas: There was an interesting policy exchange about tariffs between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris during their debate last month. Kamala Harris: My opponent has a plan that I call the Trump sales tax, which would be a 20 percent tax on everyday goods that you rely on to get through the month. Economists have said that that Trump sales tax would actually result, for middle-class families, in about $4,000 more a year because of his policies and his ideas about what should be the backs of middle-class people paying for tax cuts for billionaires. Demsas: Then Trump hit back, pointing out that the Biden-Harris team had been all too happy to keep the tariffs going. Donald Trump: First of all, I have no sales tax. That’s an incorrect statement. She knows that. We’re doing tariffs on other countries. Other countries are going to finally, after 75 years, pay us back for all that we’ve done for the world. And the tariff will be substantial in some cases. I took in billions and billions of dollars, as you know, from China. In fact, they never took the tariff off, because it was so much money, they can’t. It would totally destroy everything that they’ve set out to do. They’ve taken in billions of dollars from China and other places. They’ve left the tariffs on. Demsas: This exchange flew by many people. There was a lot going on in that debate, and this happened in the first few minutes. But Trump is pointing out something interesting here—that while Harris is calling his tariffs a sales tax, she and Biden kept the majority of his tariffs when they came into office. Looking back on 2019, Biden had similarly criticized Trump’s trade policy, arguing at the time that “any freshman econ student could tell you that the American people are paying his tariffs.” While I think it’s important to highlight this similarity, it’s also important not to overstate it. Trump is now promising a 60 percent tariff on goods from China and a 20 percent tariff on everything else the U.S. imports. And in a speech last week, Trump said he’d “impose whatever tariffs are required—100 percent, 200 percent, 1,000 percent.” This is far greater than anything Biden or Harris have publicly considered. [Music] Demsas: Welcome to Good on Paper, a policy show that questions what we really know about popular narratives. I’m your host, Jerusalem Demsas, a staff writer here at The Atlantic. And today we’re talking tariffs, trade, protectionism, and more. The standard economic narrative around tariffs is pretty negative. As my guest today has explained in a quip now famously memorialized on a novelty T-shirt: “Tariffs not only impose immense economic costs but also fail to achieve their primary policy aims and foster political dysfunction along the way.” It’s a busy shirt. Scott Lincicome is the vice president of general economics at the Cato Institute and has written broadly, including here at The Atlantic, about why the parties shouldn’t be so quick to embrace tariffs. [Music] Demsas: Scott, welcome to the show. Scott Lincicome: Well, thanks for having me. Demsas: We’re going to talk about tariffs today, so I’m going to start with the simplest question: What is a tariff? Lincicome: A tariff is a tax applied to an imported product, usually a good but, in theory, you could try to apply tariffs to services, as well. Demsas: What kinds of things that people commonly buy have tariffs on them in the United States? Lincicome: I think one of the most common examples we use is pickup trucks. In the 1960s, there was a dispute with the Europeans over chicken, of all things. That led to a tax on pickup trucks— Demsas: Wait. Wait. Wait. Slow that down. How do we get from chickens to pickup trucks? Lincicome: They were going after our chickens, so we put tariffs on their pickup trucks, and they stayed. Now we still have a 25 percent tax—tariff—on imported pickup trucks from everywhere except a few free-trade-agreement countries, like Mexico. So one of the reasons why we don’t have some of those cool little pickup trucks that you might see in Japan or whatever is because they’re subject to really ridiculous tariffs. And automakers abroad don’t want to have to deal with all the regulatory compliance and that kind of stuff and then pay another 25 percent tariff. It’s actually a great example of the things that tariffs do beyond just raising prices. They limit availability and consumer choice, and they stick around forever. We have tariffs on the books on shoes and clothing and other things that go back to the Smoot-Hawley days. They’re really hard to remove once you get them into place. Demsas: You just said something interesting. Who pays the tariff? Lincicome: It’s a little complicated. Legally, the importer in the United States, in almost all cases, is paying the tariffs. If you are a U.S. company and you are importing stuff, you’re going to be paying the tariff, by law. There’s a little exception to that, but we don’t need to worry about that. The more complicated thing comes in who actually pays, because, in theory, a foreign exporter can lower his price to essentially absorb the tariff costs. Let’s say you’re shipping widgets into the United States, and they’re $100. All of a sudden, a 25 percent tariff gets attached to it. You have, really, two basic choices: still sell at a hundred and have the importer pay $25 (25 percent of a hundred), or you lower your price to 80 and then have the importer pay $20 in tariffs. But to the importer, it’s all the same thing, right? It’s still $100. So the tariff hasn’t changed the calculus. In that sense, the foreign exporter is bearing the incidence of the tariff. Then we have the empirical question. So the empirical question is: What actually happens? Well, what actually happens is, in the vast majority of cases, importers and consumers pay the tariffs. You only have a situation where foreign exporters pay tariffs when the market that the foreign exporter wants to sell into is just massive—really important—and the exporter says, You know what? I just want to maintain market share, so I’m going to lower my prices. Typically, that’s not what happens. Typically, the consumer, the importer is going to pay the tariff. It might not be a hundred percent; the exporter might discount by a few bucks here and there. But, overall, as an empirical matter, typically consumers, importers pay. And that was certainly the case with the Trump-era tariffs on steel and aluminum and Chinese imports. Studies show that about 95 percent of the tariff incidence fell onto American companies and consumers. Demsas: And so as any listener listening to this can tell, you don’t really like tariffs. Economists, in general, don’t really like tariffs. Why is that? Can you walk us through the standard economic story for why tariffs are bad? Lincicome: I’ll start out with saying that economists are okay with tariffs in certain contexts—national security, for example. There’s a legitimate case that the United States—I’d say, a strong case the United States—shouldn’t be buying its tanks and planes and laser-guided missiles from China, that tariffs can serve a role there. But economists don’t like tariffs for a few reasons. First is that they’re costly. A tariff is a tax. It’s a tax typically borne by consumers and importers. Those consumers and importers typically are poorer, so it’s a regressive tax, meaning: More burden is paid by poorer people. They spend a larger share of their incomes on, say, tariffed bananas or whatever. But the second reason is that they are very inefficient taxes, meaning—so good tax policy is: You want a very broad base, and you want it to be very transparent, and you want to minimize gaming and other things that can poke holes and make the tax less distortionary. A tariff doesn’t qualify for anything I just said, right? It’s applied on a narrow set of products. It’s very opaque. Unlike a sales tax, you don’t get a receipt on that pickup truck that says, Oh, you just paid an extra 25 percent for this, right? It’s subject to all sorts of gaming because tariffs will vary, typically, based on the type of products. You get what’s called tariff engineering, where you’ll classify—I’ll go back to cars. There’s a famous example: Ford vans were imported without seats to get a lower tariff, and then, literally at the docks, they installed the seats and then drove them off to the warehouses. So it’s a really distortionary and inefficient way to raise revenue or do anything else you want to do with them. The other big thing, though, is that they’re pretty ineffective at boosting the companies that are getting protected and the workers that are getting protected. For example, I mentioned we have tariffs on shoes. Some of them are ridiculously high, more than 34—almost 40 percent. We have not saved any shoe jobs in the United States. We have almost no jobs in shoe manufacturing. You basically are just having consumers pay a tax for little to no good reason. And in case after case after case, what you see is: Most companies that are protected by tariffs either end up going away after the tariffs are lifted, or they’re seeking perpetual protection, right? The other big thing is that tariffs, by insulating companies from competition, discourage them from innovating. If you have a guaranteed market, you’re probably not going to be hyper-focused on staying lean and mean and really focused on delivering the best value to your customer. You will get fat, lazy, and happy. You’ll spend a lot of money on lobbying to maintain the tariffs, less money on being productive. For example, U.S. steel. So there’s probably no industry in the history of the United States that has received more protection than U.S. steel. It’s definitely on the Mount Rushmore of protectionist industries. And U.S. Steel is notoriously inefficient, in part because of that protection. It’s now trying to be bought out by Nippon Steel, a Japanese company. And the goal to—supporters of that deal, including U.S. Steel, by the way, say that Nippon Steel will help it innovate, provide it with better management practices, an influx of capital to upgrade its services. So put that all together, and economists say, You get high cost, you don’t achieve your objectives, and this is pretty bad. And then you throw in—the historians have looked back at tariff history, especially in the 19th century but even most recently. And tariffs are really historically associated with corruption and cronyism. And that goes back to them being kind of a hidden tax. Also, they target foreigners, and that makes it easier to sell. The economics of trade are counterintuitive. And so tariff policy is notoriously corrupt. And so there’s a lot of political dysfunction, along with just hiring all those lobbyists to get special tariffs or special exemptions. But also, it’s just a very politically perilous policy, as well. Demsas: You said a lot there. And I want to dig in on a few of these things, but I think as a broad overview, obviously, the idea is: You have to do a benefit-cost analysis of tariff policy. And you’ve obviously articulated a lot of reasons why there are high costs to tariffs, but, as you mentioned with national security, for instance, there are a lot of noneconomic things that policymakers are concerned with that they may want to use tariffs for. And so you think about the implications of what tariffs are trying to do, and often there’s this goal of, We want to spur some sort of industry in the United States. Often, it’s domestic manufacturing, right? You kind of asided to that with the shoe example. But there’s a history of this, right? Actually, last week, we just had on the show Oliver Kim, who was talking to us about the East Asian development miracle. And one thing that a lot of East Asian countries are credited with doing is having protected native industries and ensuring that those industries were able to succeed on the world market. And there was a lot of protectionism that was involved in doing that, including tariffs. And so what I guess I would ask you is, firstly, do you feel like that is a goal the U.S. government should have of trying to spur domestic manufacturing? Do you think that’s an important goal? Lincicome: No. At least not via tariffs. I think there is a million things that the United States government could be doing to boost the manufacturing sector. I should note, of course, the United States is the world’s second-largest manufacturing nation in terms of output, in terms of productivity. So the stuff we make per worker—we’re absolutely crushing it. No. 1 in the world, basically, for large, industrialized nations, so it’s not like the United States is this weak, nothing-burger nation when it comes to manufacturing. But that aside, there’s a couple caveats I think you need to include when you talk about Asian protectionism and industrial policy. First is: That came with a lot of free trade too. While, certainly, there was some protection for certain industries, there was also a lot of exposure to competition in export markets, in particular, but also in import markets. And, though, there was a lot of tariff liberalization for the things that manufacturers they were trying to support—that they needed. So it wasn’t this just blanket protectionist policy. The second big thing, though, is that there is a bit of a correlation-versus-causation thing in a lot of East Asian industrial-policy narratives because they were doing a lot of other stuff at the exact same time. And there’s a great book by Arvind Panagariya, who actually looks at South Korea and Taiwan and others and says, Actually, these economies performed better when they weren’t being protectionist—when they weren’t engaging this heavy-handed industrial policy—than when they were. So we need to be a little bit cautious there. But the third, and I think the most important one for the United States, is that the East Asian miracle applied to a radically different economy than the one in the United States in two big ways. One: Those were developing countries really trying to push infant industries, whereas most U.S. protection is—I mean, the U.S. is certainly not a developing economy. We’re a very developed economy. And most of our protection actually goes to lagging industries. It is not on the cutting edge, and one of the reasons—we have a lot of cutting-edge stuff. But typically, our protection goes to, again, shoes and steel and stuff like that—legacy industries. But the other thing is that the United States has far-more-developed capital markets than Asian economies did—very open, very fluid. And that means we have much-more-efficient investment where there might be the potential for that success and that innovation. And so it’s less likely that government planners in the United States are going to be able to pick the right industries, pick the right companies, pick the right whatever, as opposed to capital markets and VCs and private equity and all that great stuff. And in general, though, it’s just a radically different environment than what existed in, say, South Korea in the 1970s. Demsas: But then let’s take a look at the CHIPS and Science Act, for instance, right? That’s the 2022 law Joe Biden signed to bring semiconductor manufacturing to the United States. So during the pandemic, there’s a real concern about semiconductor chips, that we’re not going to be able to have as many. There’s obviously this big shortage. We’re really reliant on Taiwan, which is, of course, concerning because of its proximity to China and the threat that China poses to Taiwan’s freedom. It’s clear that there is a need to produce, at least in—if not domestically, we need to “friendshore.” We need to make sure can get those supplies from ally countries that we’re less worried about having some kind of future political risk with, but also just domestically because there might be supply-chain problems in the future that are unprecedented, like a global pandemic that we had not been expecting. And so the CHIPS Act is an industrial policy where there is a real push to get chips made here in the United States. We have factories opening up. I believe they are already producing chips. There’s an Arizona factory. Lincicome: Yeah. TSMC is not quite up yet. Demsas: Okay. Not up yet. But basically, we brought Taiwanese expertise to the United States, and they’re building here. We have American jobs that are being created here. And you may care about parts of that or not, but that seems like a policy where that’s on the cutting edge. It’s not confusing to make these chips, but it is a cutting-edge technology. It’s not a legacy industry. So how do you view the use of protection there? Lincicome: Yeah. Two things: One is that it’s really important to start by noting that this CHIPS Act is subsidies and not tariffs. Now, Biden just imposed some tariffs on semiconductors from China but, in general, the CHIPS Act is just about throwing money at companies. In general, if you’re going to ask an economist, What would you prefer: a domestic subsidy or a tariff? they’re going to say, A subsidy, nine times out of 10, right? That’s important because you’re at least—granted you’re subsidizing the production, but you’re at least—once the company gets up and running, going to be subjecting it to market forces and competition and its production and output and the rest. You’re not going to be artificially raising prices for downstream consumers and that kind of stuff. So a subsidy is definitely preferable to a tariff. And in fact, we actually applied tariffs to semiconductors in the 1980s. We had a big industrial policy push in the ’80s related to chips, Japanese memory chips. We applied a bunch of different tariffs, any dumping duties. There was a trade agreement restricting Japanese semiconductors. And what happened? Well, it raised the price of semiconductors and pushed computer manufacturers offshore from the U.S. computer manufacturers. So tariffs, again—historically not very good at achieving your objectives. But the other thing with the CHIPS Act is: It is starting to reveal some of the problems with industrial policy that we saw back then too. For example, back then, we actually picked—we, the government—picked the wrong type of semiconductor. The Department of Defense in the ’80s thought memory chips were going to be the big innovative thing of the future. So we targeted memory chips. Well, it turns out that the entire industry was actually moving towards logic chips, which are what we use today. And the government totally missed that, while imposing all of those costs. Right now, we might have a bit of a similar situation because you mentioned TSMC—and TSMC is a global leader. Okay. Cool. But also, the biggest subsidy recipient was Intel. Intel is our national champion. Intel is struggling like crazy. Intel is slated to receive as much as $45 billion in total subsidies because the CHIPS Act had grants, loans, and tax credits. So Intel is really in trouble. So did we, once again, pick a loser, along with TSMC? So that’s, I think, a concern we have to deal with. And that’s a traditional issue with industrial policy. Now, why did Intel get all that money? Well, Intel is an American company. Intel has an army of lobbyists in Washington, was instrumental in getting the CHIPS Act passed. Intel decided to locate its facilities in Ohio, a politically important place. And thus, there are questions about whether the government should, again, be giving $45 billion taxpayer dollars to a struggling company like Intel. Demsas: You’re pointing out a glut of good reasons why it’s not the most optimally efficient policy. But it seems obvious to me, at least, that it’s important for us to make semiconductors here or at least friendshore them. Is there an alternative way to do this? Lincicome: Yeah. Sure. Well, let me say one more thing about TSMC’s [fabrication facility], and then we’ll move onto your question. The other problem—and the thing I’m worried about—is that we’re actually not subsidizing bleeding-edge technology. TSMC’s fab that’ll be up and running next year is going to be very small, relative to its factories in Taiwan, and it’s not going to be producing the tippy-top-most innovative chip. It’s going to be producing four-nanometer chips instead of the industry two. It’s also insanely costly. Apparently, it’s costing about 50 percent more to build. And then, of course, a lot of other chip companies that aren’t TSMC are getting money, too, and not just Intel. And they’re getting money to produce what we call legacy chips. So these are clunky commodity chips that really have no security or even, really, innovative nexus. So I think we should be concerned. I don’t know the answer yet. You know, it’s still early in the ballgame, but there are some warning signs. Now, what could we do instead? A lot, because the big reason why companies weren’t producing a lot of chips here—although that’s a bit of a myth. About half of all chips consumed by American companies were still made in America before the CHIPS Act. But beyond that, we did lose some bleeding-edge capacity. Now, why did that happen? No. 1 reason is because of Intel. Intel was at the frontier and then totally botched it at 10 nanometers and has just become extremely behind the curve. So it’s just a corporate decision-making thing, nothing related to industrial policy. But the other big reason is because it costs a darn fortune to build a semiconductor facility in the United States. Now, some of that is just because we’re the United States. Things are more expensive than in a developing country. But a lot of it is permitting issues and materials issues and immigration issues. The semiconductor industry is one of the most immigrant-dependent industries in the United States. So tax issues, as well—we tax the construction of large structures at a much higher rate than we tax things like software and the rest. So you combine all these things, and there’s a free-market path to encouraging the onshoring of large manufacturing facilities, whether it’s semiconductors or anything else, and you could have tax reform and immigration reform and trade reform. Maybe we don’t put tariffs on construction materials and steel and everything else. So that’s a big part of it. And to the extent even that didn’t do the job, then you could see a role for the government to provide a targeted subsidy for national-security-related chips, so things our Defense Department needs or the tippy-tippy-bleeding-edge stuff that we need for, like, government supercomputers and the rest. But we didn’t get that. You know, that’s maybe a $5 billion bill. And, instead, we got this $60 billion—and then plus another $200 billion in potential tax credit—slush fund that just goes to anything and everything. So I think that’s a problem. And that’s a problem with industrial policy. What starts out as maybe a decent idea on paper just morphs into kind of a political albatross. Demsas: The only argument that I’ve seen that defends broad-based tariffs—because very few people will defend the, like, 60 percent tariff on goods from China, 20 percent on everything else the U.S. imports. I don’t think we even grow bananas. Even stuff we don’t actually make, no industries—coffee, stuff like that. But the one argument I have heard is that, while you don’t see increases in domestic manufacturing from these smaller tariffs, if you were to do this really broad-based tariff, it would just force industries to invest in the American economy, because American demand is just both lucrative but also, it would just reshape how capital markets thought about where to invest in companies. It would reshape the kinds of entrepreneurship that would happen, because now we do have to figure out how to satiate this American demand that they’ve been priced out of buying these cheaper goods from abroad. So setting aside the question about whether or not that would be good for the American consumer to have to now pay double or triple or whatever it is for these basic goods, why wouldn’t that work? Or what do you think would happen in a world where you actually saw these massive tariffs? You can go even higher. Like, you can say 60 percent tariffs on all goods outside the United States. What would actually happen here? Lincicome: Yeah. So basically North Korea, right? And I joke, but the reality is that tariffs also come with a deadweight loss, an economic loss in terms of economic growth and the rest. Yes. The United States is a big, diverse country with a very productive workforce and a lot of smart people and wonderful capital markets. But if you started imposing giant tariff walls, you’d have a few problems—the biggest being slower economic growth. By pushing workers into less productive industries, you would effectively be ensuring that the workforce, as a whole, is less productive. That means lower wages, less innovation outside of the sectors you’re targeting, right? You would push a lot of workers and resources into lower-value production. And let’s just leave aside the fact that you’d need giant greenhouses for bananas and stuff like that. We’ll leave that out. Demsas: Or we just don’t have bananas. No bananas. Yeah. Lincicome: Right. Heaven forbid. But I do think that’s the other thing that you would have to also consider. You would not just have lower economic growth and slower wages, but I think non-financially, it’d be a lower quality of life. And the grocery store is a wonderful example of that. I can remember back in the 1980s, the grocery store was not nearly as incredible as it is today. And a lot of that, today, is owed to open trade, globalization. And you would lose some of that. You would lose the variety and some of the things that make our lives richer. And I don’t just, by the way, mean bananas. And I don’t just mean food, although that’s a big one. We have this big globalization series going on. And we talk about fashion and film, and you can go down and on and on down the list. And there’s a lot of aspects of trade and open markets that make our lives fuller and richer in ways that aren’t just about where we’re working or how much we’re making, right? And so that would mean a little less, if not a lot less, of that too. I mentioned at the beginning those cool European and Asian pickup trucks we don’t get. Well, we wouldn’t get those either. We would just have fewer varieties of those things, even if, let’s assume prices are a little bit higher. Sure. But we just also wouldn’t have the variety. Demsas: I agree with you on this, but then it also gets to a point where sometimes I’m talking to people, and I realize there’s a difference in value. Some people don’t care about this, or they think it’s less important. They think that if we could get more manufacturing jobs in the United States, then it’s okay for us not to have bananas. It’s okay for us not to have a great variety of trucks. Is that stuff important? And I wonder, doesn’t this fall then down to political value judgment about what kind of world looks best? Lincicome: Yeah—yes and no, because I think if you started saying things like, Well, would you accept less medical innovation? Would you accept less scientific innovation outside of that? because resources are finite—so I think that if you gave people the fuller picture of the price of autarky, I think they would recoil. Particularly if you added things like, And also, your 401(k) is going to be smaller. Your houses are going to be smaller, there’s going to be less resiliency, not more. You might remember the baby-formula crisis, right? Well, we made all baby formula in the United States, except—because of protectionism. We had walls— tariff wall, non-tariff wall—around the country. Ninety-eight percent of baby formula consumed here was made here. We had a one factory closure, and the entire supply chain collapsed for a year. So you would have actually a more brittle economy than a more resilient one. We would not, at the end of the day, enjoy the much lower living standards, overall, just because we had a few more manufacturing jobs that people don’t even want. [Music] Demsas: We’re going to take a quick break. More with Scott when we get back. [Break] Demsas: Something you mentioned earlier on I always think is interesting is: The connection between tariff loving and immigration hating I always find very bizarre. We’re at low unemployment right now, so if you’re trying to spur more people to work in domestic manufacturing, it means you’re moving people out of other industries to work towards manufacturing. And if you have the kind of broad-based tariffs that are being proposed by the Trump-Vance ticket—I mean, they’re proposing, like, 60 percent on goods from China and up to 20 percent on everything else from the U.S. imports. These are massive, massive tariffs. That sort of thing means that you’re going to have the U.S. producing a ton more of the goods that Americans consume. And that would indicate that you would want more people coming here and working here. But at the same time, they’re opposed to immigration. So why do you think the anti-immigration and pro-tariff sentiments have gone hand in hand? They’re trying to deport millions of people too. I forgot about that. Lincicome: Nationalist sentiment, right? Look—I don’t think there’s a lot of logic or coherence in most economic nationalist arguments. And I think this is just a great example of it, for the reason you said, right? This isn’t 2014 anymore. Native-born employment has flatlined. We are an economy that needs more workers if it wants to grow at the rates we have grown accustomed to in the past. And that means we’re going to need just warm bodies. Just in terms of warm bodies, we’re going to need more of them. And obviously, immigration is a great source. I mean, babies are great, too, but they take at least 18 years to become workers, right? So we can’t do that tomorrow—at least, not that I’m aware of. I don’t know what the science is doing— Demsas: Latest technology? I think it’s still 18 years. Lincicome: Right. So we’re going to have a while on that. So immigrants are the obvious source for, you know—if we’re going to be making toasters in America again, like J.D. Vance wants, we’re going to need workers to do that. And robots are great, but robots can’t fill the gap entirely, particularly, again, in the near term. So there’s a huge disconnect there. And the other thing I’d note is that native-born Americans, in general, just don’t want to work in manufacturing. And this is something totally missed. We at Cato did a very expansive poll over the summer, asking people all sorts of questions. One of the questions we asked was a two-parter: One, Do you think the U.S. should have more manufacturing jobs? And it was, like, 80 percent yes. Yes. More people should work in manufacturing. Then we said, Do you want to work in manufacturing? And it was, like, 20 percent said yes. It’s almost the exact flip. There was a great article in Bloomberg a couple of years ago about furniture manufacturing here in North Carolina, talking about how they can’t find workers. And this was pre-pandemic, so it’s certainly gotten worse since then. You look at—the textile-manufacturing jobs in South Carolina pay $11 an hour to start. These are not the glamorous jobs that a lot of our politicians think they are. So to the extent we want these jobs in the United States, I am ambivalent. I want the market to determine that. Big surprise. They’re just going to have to come to the reality that we’re going to need more workers to do that. And, again, immigration’s the source. But there is another thing that I think the nationalists miss entirely, is that free trade actually can help reduce some of the immigration pressures in places like Central America, for example, because it’s going to boost the local economies and boost the stability of these places. Because a lot of immigration is that push-pull, right? People are living in terrible places. They’re like, I got to get the heck out of here. But also, the U.S. economy’s pulling them in. So to the extent that a trade agreement—and allowing companies to access the U.S. market to sell us shirts and stuff like that—can actually boost the local economies in places like, say, Guatemala, that’s going to actually reduce some of that push pressure on immigration, legal or otherwise. And there’s a fantastic study that actually showed everything I just said, most recently, and it said that you could reduce illegal border crossings by several hundred thousand if you had truly free trade with Central America for textiles, for the reasons I just described. So is that a panacea for the border issues? No. But would it help? Yes. And it is completely lost on our anti-immigration, anti-trade folks, the idea that trading more with places would actually reduce some pressures for more immigrants. They just want no trade and no immigrants, which just doesn’t make a lot of sense. Demsas: I want to get into some of the reasons for why tariffs haven’t been able to increase domestic manufacturing. There’s a really great study. Aaron Flaaen and Justin Pierce at the Fed—I hope, Aaron, I’m saying your last name correctly. I apologize if not. And they had this study where they looked at the Trump tariffs—the 2018, 2019 tariffs—and they find that the U.S. industries most exposed to tariff increases experienced reductions in employment. And they also find that counties more exposed to rising tariffs show increases in unemployment—more people are unemployed in counties that are more exposed to rising tariffs—and, of course, declines in labor-force participation. So people are just exiting the labor force entirely there. Why is that happening? Because why is even this narrow case of tariffs—they’re big tariffs, but they’re nothing like they’re being proposed now—why did that not improve domestic manufacturing? Lincicome: Right. For the moment, let’s just leave aside that the vast majority of us work in services. And if you work in services, you’re basically hurt by tariffs, regardless of anything. Demsas: Okay. This is one of my hobbyhorses, that whenever everyone talks about the working class, we pretend like everyone’s a manufacturer, but really everyone’s in the service industry, and it’s like, No one cares about those people. McDonald’s? Don’t care about them. It’s just bizarre. Lincicome: It’s crazy. Even for male-dominated professions—because we’re all worried about men not working and stuff—there are four times as many male-dominated, blue-collar jobs in services than there are in manufacturing. And we never talk about any of it, like you said. Whether it’s construction or security or repair, like automotive repair, you name it, there’s tons of jobs. Nobody talks about them. But anyway, we’re going to ignore all of those folks. Demsas: Just like our political leaders. Lincicome: Right. We’re going to ignore them. Sorry. Sorry, folks. We can get back to them later. Manufacturing—there’s three big reasons why tariffs actually harm American manufacturing. The first is that American manufacturing today is very much global. About half of everything we import into the United States is actually stuff used by American manufacturers to make other stuff—things like steel or machinery and semiconductors. The huge example of that is: The most advanced semiconductor-production technology comes from the Netherlands. We import that equipment to support semiconductor production in the United States, right? Demsas: These are intermediate goods. Lincicome: Yeah—intermediate. Oh, look at you! Nice. Yes. Exactly. Demsas: (Laughs.) Lincicome: When people use trade wonky terms, I’m always impressed. That’s great. So all these intermediate goods—you raise the price of those goods, which tariffs do, and you raise costs for manufacturers. That means those manufacturers spend less on employment and investment and the rest. You’re just raising their costs. It’s like a corporate tax but only for manufacturers that consume imports, which, again, is most of them. The second big channel is the export side, and that is through retaliation. Foreign governments typically don’t just sit there after a tariff is imposed on products they’re exporting and say, Oh, you got us. We’re toast. No. They retaliate. And they retaliate because they have their own domestic political considerations. They have strategic considerations about preventing even more tariffs. So that harms American manufacturers that export—American manufacturers that are already hurt because they’re facing higher import costs. So those companies are getting hit two ways: higher input costs and retaliation. The third channel is currency, and I won’t get into the weeds, but tariffs tend to increase the value of the domestic currency. So the dollar gets stronger. As the dollar gets stronger, there’s a good thing: That means that imports get a little cheaper. So it’ll offset some of that tariff pain. The bad thing is that it makes exports more expensive, and anybody who’s gone abroad and has a really strong dollar knows you can buy a ton abroad. That’s actually an import. You’re getting cheap imports. But if the dollar gets really weak and you go abroad, it’s the opposite. So just kind of think of it—it’s kind of those mechanisms, right? So those three channels, effectively, eliminate any benefit that manufacturers might get from tariff protection. And thus, like you said, the literature tends to show that countries with higher tariffs don’t have wonderful trade surpluses or burgeoning manufacturing industries. And in the United States, the empirical research from the Trump era shows much the same thing. Demsas: You’ve talked about the narrow cases in which tariffs make sense to you, which I think, largely, is around national security. But I think once you accept that logic, then it just becomes a political question about what things people value, right? There is this sense that people really care about protecting the manufacturing legacy of specific areas in the United States. And this is, I think, a legacy of 2016, when a lot of people were surprised by the victory of Donald Trump to the presidency. There was a lot of indexing on the fact that he won Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania and seeing that this narrative—that he really spoke to the white working class who had been disaffected by free trade. And this, of course, is right when the “China Shock” paper is becoming really central to the discourse. And so there’s a level here where I wonder if there’s a political-narrative thing that’s going on here, too, where, regardless of all the stuff that we’re talking about, if people want to win national elections, is this just necessary? Lincicome: No. I’m a firm believer that a lot of what’s going on with our protectionist moment right now is political. The conventional wisdom in Washington today is that, to win national elections, you need to win a handful of gettable votes—so Obama–Trump voters, basically, people who flipped—in a handful of important places, mainly in the industrial Midwest. And to win those votes, you need to offer lots of protectionism and industrial policy too—manufacturing-centric policy. And I think that is the reality—the conventional wisdom is. I think that is the case. I don’t necessarily agree with it, but I’m not a political consultant, so I won’t dare to question it. And there was a good paper recently by Autor, Dorn, and Hanson, another person—the “China Shock” authors—that said that Republicans did gain a little bit in places, thanks to the tariffs. Even though those places didn’t actually benefit economically, the tariffs were a political winner for Republicans, thanks to the idea that they were being protected. They weren’t actually being protected. The economy was actually a little worse. But they thought they were, and they were rewarding politicians for that. So I think that is the case. And it’s unfortunate because, first, I am not entirely convinced that tariffs and protectionism were what tipped the 2016 election. There’s a lot of other stuff bubbling under the surface. But the other big thing is: You actually look at the effect of import competition on these places pre-Trump, and it’s not nearly as devastating as the narrative makes it sound. Whether it’s the China Shock or NAFTA or anything else, these things undoubtedly had a small but significant negative effect on certain places, but it was small. There’s a lot of bigger things going on in terms of manufacturing job loss, in terms of communities surviving or dying. There’s a great study a few years ago from Brookings that found that, like, 80 percent of old industrial cities in the United States had transitioned to successful economies—places like Pittsburgh. So not every place ended up being like Youngstown, Ohio, right? Yet there’s this narrative that it was all trade, and every place got crushed. And that’s just not the reality, you know? And the other thing we ignore entirely is interstate competition. A lot of the jobs in the Rust Belt manufacturing—they’re still in the United States. They’re just not in the Rust Belt anymore. They’re in the Sun Belt. We don’t talk about that at all, either. It is all trade, trade, trade. And I think that’s really unfortunate. At the end of the day, what does that do? It means that the real solutions—and there are a lot of policies that could be pursued to help people adjust, to give them better training and education, to help them move if they need to move by lowering housing prices (you know all about that)—we don’t do any of those. Or, at least, we don’t focus on those. Instead, it’s like, Ah. We’ll just slap a tariff on a toaster, and suddenly Youngstown will be thriving again. And that’s just not reality, not just in the literature. It just doesn’t make any sense. But that’s politics for you, right? Demsas: Yeah. Yeah. I also think that one of the things that I wanted to get your—because you’ve thought about this for years as someone who’s working in trade. The political dynamics of tariffs, I think, are really important to understand. I think, broadly, my question for you is: Why are tariffs so popular if they’re so harmful? What is going on that, if you’re right, it’s creating all these problems, from baby-formula shortages, which is extremely politically costly, other kinds of shortages during the pandemic—very, very costly. If it’s leading to lower growth—all this stuff—what’s happening? Why doesn’t the political party just win 300 electoral votes by campaigning against tariffs? Lincicome: Right. Because they are extremely politically attractive to voters. There’s a guy named Bryan Caplan who wrote a wonderful book several years ago called The Myth of the Rational Voter. He’s a George Mason economist, libertarian guy. But this is more political-science oriented. He ticks through a bunch of biases we all have. And bias is kind of a bad connotation, but I don’t mean it that way. I just mean things that we innately feel. And tariffs check all of the boxes: an anti-foreign bias, a make-work bias. We like things that produce jobs, right? We have a status-quo bias. Like, we want to protect things that we see that are right in front of us. We are less inclined to want the unseen or the things we don’t know. We can, in fact, fear them. You can go down the list, and tariffs check all of those boxes. So that’s the first thing. Voters innately think, Oh, that’s great. You’re going to protect jobs with that tariff. Wonderful. But beyond that, the economics of tariffs are hard. It is counterintuitive that a tariff might actually reduce manufacturing output, right? It is counterintuitive, I think, that a trade deficit isn’t necessarily a bad thing. It sounds terrible, right? And it’s counterintuitive that if you cut imports, you actually cut exports too. So there’s all these little things in trade economics that make it a hard sell. And then, finally: It’s opaque. I mentioned before, when you go to the gas station, you see how prices change. So even some voters that are somewhat connected to the news can be like, Oh, wow. There’s this new conflict with Iran and Israel, and gas prices are going to go up. I get that connection. You don’t really get that with tariffs. Demsas: So you need a tariff ticker in grocery stores to show— Lincicome: Yes. I’ve actually long said we need—just the gas station ticker, you need that as well. I think that if you got a receipt from the grocery store and a lot of the line items was the tariff amount, I think that probably would change a few minds. And then, finally, the other thing is that tariffs are oftentimes a corporate tax, and corporate taxes can be hidden. They can either be absorbed by companies or passed on to consumers, again, in invisible ways. And that makes it hard too. So it’s a very, very tough sell. Now, I’ll note: We’ve known everything I just said for decades, if not centuries. And politicians came up with a fix. It’s called a trade agreement. Trade agreements are not, contrary to popular belief, primarily economic or even about foreign policy. They’re primarily political. There are ways for governments to tie their own hands when it comes to tariff policy. They’re like, I can’t be trusted with this. We went through Smoot-Hawley and all these other bad tariff episodes. We can’t be trusted with guiding tariff policy. So we’re going to delegate it all to the president, which, by the way, that was not the best idea, given Trump. But beyond that, we’re entering into agreements that essentially say that if we go back on our promises, well, what happens? Then the countries we’re trading with can retaliate, there can be litigation and the rest. And that can act as a check. The other big thing is: We’re going to offset import-competing industries. We’re going to offset their political power with exporters, and trade agreements are going to do that too. Because that’s the other political attractiveness, right? Concentrated benefits and diffuse costs. The benefits of protectionism are very narrow, like the steel industry. Costs of protection are diffused. We all bear those little costs—again, an invisible cost. So how do you offset that? Well, a trade agreement does that, too, because you have exporters that are like, Oh, but I want access to that market. And I don’t just mean Boeing. I mean financial services and other companies. And so that was the political solution. Now, trade agreements have problems, but they were reasonably successful for 80 years in liberalizing trade, integrating economies, and checking the protectionist impulses of our political class. It was only in the last decade that Donald Trump hacked the whole machine. And we’re basically dealing with the aftermath. Demsas: Yeah. This diffuse-benefits, concentrated-cost thing—I think it’s just so key. Also, because even after the political constituency has died, it’s kind of hard—in general, once a law gets passed, it’s really durable. Repealing that law, on not just tariff policy but all policies—it kind of just lives on its own. It develops a constituency, whether it’s in the government or outside the government, that wants its continuation. And there’s also very few people who are going to make their political hobbyhorse to do good-governance reforms. But I write about housing policy a lot. And it’s funny—everyone is talking about housing policy now. Everyone’s talking about how to reduce the cost of housing, make it easier to do construction, all this sort of thing. I’ll have people who are in the Democratic Party or in the administration saying things like, Jerusalem, we need to lower costs. We need innovative ways for the federal government to do this. It’s really hard. It’s all at state and local level. And I’ll often just say, Hey. Did you guys know there are, like, massive tariffs on Canadian lumber, on Canadian softwood lumber? And they doubled those tariffs in August. And there’s none of this thinking about the diffuse costs to the American people. Like, Congress isn’t working on fixing that. It’s just a level at which I believe that they all care about lowering the cost of housing. I think that’s not a fake thing that they’re talking about here. But we don’t even think about tariff policy when we’re thinking about broad economic costs to the public. We only think about them narrowly in the question of, How does it hurt or benefit this specific industry? and not, What is the harm to the rest of the public? Lincicome: For sure. And every time you bring up potentially lifting the tariffs that are in place, what happens? Well, big lumber comes to your congressional office or big dairy when the—the dairy industry in the United States, highly protected. When the baby-formula thing was going down, they were vigorously opposing a long-term elimination of the tariffs on baby formula. Now, think about that for a second: baby formula. And these guys are out there, big dairy is out there fighting it. And it worked. Congress has not eliminated those tariffs, even though it’s the most sympathetic consumer possible, right? Demsas: And it was broadly unpopular. It’s very unpopular, what happened with the baby formula. Lincicome: Exactly. And every time you scratch a tariff, there’s a crony underneath, and they’re going to fight like heck to keep their windfall profits. And they’re paying attention. They’re editing Wikipedia pages to make the protectionism sound better. They are the ones laser focused on keeping the protection in place, while the rest of us are like, Well, five cents for some food that’s subject to a tariff, a few dollars here and there extra for a refrigerator or washing machine. Oh, well. But that stuff adds up, of course. Studies show that if you eliminated all of the protectionism that’s remaining in the U.S. economy—and we’re a pretty open economy—you would save consumers hundreds of dollars a year, if not more. And yet, because it is 10 cents here and 10 cents there, it just doesn’t resonate. And the other side is extremely motivated. Demsas: Well, thank you so much, Scott. I have one last question for you. And it’s: What’s an idea that you had that seemed good at the time but turned out to only be good on paper? Lincicome: Yeah. I struggled with this question. Demsas: Because you’ve always been right? Yeah. (Laughs.) Lincicome: Well, no, no, no. Because I wanted to find a good one. Self-checkout is my answer. Demsas: Oh, yeah? Lincicome: Yeah. I am a huge fan of self-checkout. And being me, I’m also a big fan of just efficiency, right? Waiting in line is terrible. I wrote a whole column about why you should never wait in line, because of the opportunity cost of doing so. So self-checkout—in theory, self-checkout is this amazing life hack. And I still love it, but I’m realizing that—let’s face it—and companies are realizing that self-checkout is not nearly the labor-saving, time-saving miracle that we think. And that’s because humans, alas, are still human. And for every guy like me who literally treats it like I’m trying to beat my best time ever at Costco when I’m going through the self-check—my daughter’s, like, handing me stuff. I mean, we’re literally gamifying it. It’s so great. Demsas: This is how I feel in the airport security line. I get so angry. Lincicome: For every person like me, who’s trying to get out of there as soon as possible and trying to break his own personal record, there are, like, 74 other people who are utterly confused by the technology, in no rush, wanting to maybe chat with the person behind the counter, wanting to pay by a check, confused by their coupons, or trying to steal. That’s the other big thing. And so, unfortunately, it has turned out that self-check is not the miracle technology that I was hoping. So it looked good on paper but less so in reality. Demsas: There’s a Safeway near my house. I moved recently, so I was checking out the nearby grocery stores. And the self-checkout is, like, I don’t know, an armed state. It’s so insane. You can’t exit the checkout without scanning your receipt. And I usually just throw my receipt away immediately, so I had to go get the receipt out of the trash. It wasn’t even functioning. Someone had to come and let me out and then look at all my stuff and make sure I wasn’t stealing. It was just this level of just—it genuinely would have taken me so much less time to wait in this line. But every time, I still go to the self-check. I don’t know why I’m doing it to myself. Lincicome: Of course. No. And I have a dream of opening up my own supermarket where we actually time people, and there’s, like, posted records of all this. But no. Alas, it still runs into problems. Demsas: Well, Scott, thank you so much for coming on the show. Lincicome: My pleasure. Thanks for having me. Great talk. [Music] Demsas: Good on Paper is produced by Jinae West.
