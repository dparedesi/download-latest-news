When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The Lenovo Legion 5i (Gen 9) feels extremely familiar to other mid-range Legion laptops of the last few years in that it's unapologetically 'chonky,' but still delivers reliably excellent gaming performance in a reassuringly sturdy chassis. It certainly doesn't wow outside of being a gaming laptop, but more odd is how forgotten this laptop feels in the current Legion lineup (and how surprisingly difficult it was to track down where you can buy one). Sturdy, practical design with healthy port selection Excellent gaming performance and thermal management Comfortable and responsive keyboard Attractive pricing, especially with frequent sales Feels oddly placed between the Legion Slim 5i and Legion Pro 5i laptops Definitely not suited for anything outside gaming and graphically intensive work Why you can trust Windows Central Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test. The Lenovo Legion line of gaming hardware and accessories has continually expanded over the years to the point where Lenovo even created the new LOQ brand specifically for its budget gaming devices. • Pricing & specs• Design & build quality• Display quality• Performance & thermals• Battery experience• Keyboard & everything else• Competition• Score card & final thoughts That's been great for giving customers choices, and Lenovo has become a very reliable recommendation for those seeking a straightforward, dependable gaming laptop. The Lenovo Legion 5 line dominates the mid-range category, and the Legion 5i (Gen 9) I've been testing sits in the middle of that family. It's a familiar experience with a practical and hefty design, excellent gaming performance, and reasonable pricing. It'd be an easy recommendation, except it awkwardly sits between the longer-lasting Legion Slim 5i and the more powerful Legion Pro 5i like the neglected middle child — and if you do some shopping, you'll notice that Lenovo and retailers alike are far more likely to recommend the Slim and Pro variants to you than this one — even if I'd sooner suggest this laptop before its Pro big sibling. This review was made possible thanks to a review sample provided by Lenovo. The company had no input nor saw the contents of this review prior to publication. • Price: ~$1,609.99-$1,949.99 at Lenovo• Display: 16-inch IPS LCD, 16:10 aspect ratio, QHD+ (2,560 x 1,600) resolution, 165Hz refresh rate, 350nits max brightness, anti-glare coating, non-touch, Dolby Vision HDR support, NVIDIA G-SYNC support• CPU: Intel Core i9-14900HX (24 cores, 32 threads, up to 5.8GHz)• GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 (8GB DDR6)• NPU: None (Lenovo LA1 chip for Lenovo AI Engine+ support)• RAM: 32GB DDR5 @ 5,600MHz (2x 16GB, SODIMM)• Storage: 1TB M.2 2280 NVMe PCIe Gen 4x4 SSD• Battery: 80Whr, Rapid Charge Pro support w/ 230W adapter• Dimensions: 359.7 x 262.3 x 19.7-25.2mm (14.16 x 10.33 x 0.78-0.99in)• Weight: 2.36kg (5.2lbs) Pricing and availability for the Lenovo Legion 5i (Gen 9) are odd, to say the least. Most retailers you'd first go to for all your laptop buying needs aren't likely to offer this laptop at all (Best Buy selling both the Slim and Pro variants is a great example of this), and even Lenovo sells few pre-configured models and somewhat limits your choices in its custom configurator. The only shop I could find my exact review configuration was Costco, of all places. That's alright, though, because the Intel Core i9 inside my unit seems a little overkill when paired with the rest of the internals. The most affordable Legion 5i (Gen 9) straight from the source is $1,120.99 at Lenovo (at least at the time of writing), which gets you a Core i7-14650HX, RTX 4060, 16GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD in a well-specced, balanced mid-range gaming laptop. The Lenovo Legion 5i custom configurator starts from $1,239.99 at Lenovo at the time of writing, giving you more options but costing you a little more across the board. Either way, the Lenovo Legion 5i (Gen 9) consistently costs less than the Legion Pro 5i, with the only differences being a gently more compact design, barely different port selection, and slightly worse overall performance. In the box, you'll find the Lenovo Legion 5i (Gen 9), a proprietary 230W DC charger and adapter, a 3-month subscription for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, and a replaceable rear vent plate with a blue accent color (versus the default flat grey). Lenovo Legion 5i (Gen 9) — Buy now at Lenovo ($1,120.99 at time of writing) This variant of the Lenovo Legion 5i is powered by an Intel Core i7-14650HX, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060, 16GB of RAM, and 1TB of SSD storage. At the time of this review Lenovo lists this with a ridiculous retail price of $1,789.99, but the discounted $1,120.99 is an excellent price for this laptop. 👉See at: Lenovo.com If you've seen one Lenovo Legion laptop in the last few years, you've essentially seen them all. Sure, there have been refinements and improvements made over the years, but Legion devices have remained remarkably consistent over time. The Legion 5i is like the Legion Pro 5i and Legion Slim 5i — it makes no attempt at being the thinnest or lightest gaming laptop. This is just a really practical design that feels incredibly durable and reliable. The Legion 5i is actually thinner (~25.2 vs. ~26.8mm) and lighter (2.36 vs. 2.5kg) than the Legion Pro 5i and puts all of its vents on the rear and bottom. This means your ports are more spread out, but overall, it's a very similar configuration. You get one USB Type-C 3.2 Gen 2 port with 140W Power Delivery and DisplayPort 1.4, a second USB Type-C 3.2 Gen 2 port with DisplayPort 1.4, three USB Type-A 3.2 Gen 1 ports (one is always on), and HDMI 2.1 port that supports up to 4K at 120Hz or 8K at 60Hz, an RJ45 Ethernet port, a microSD card reader, and a 3.5mm audio jack. For comparison, the Legion Pro 5i loses the microSD card reader but gains a fourth USB Type-A port. Finally, there's the familiar 230W DC charging port, which supports up to 300W for more powerful configurations. The Lenovo Legion 5i feels familiar once again when you look at its display. It's the same panel across the entire Legion 5 lineup, actually (with the exception of an optional 240Hz configuration), meaning you're looking at 16 inches of QHD+ (2,560 x 1,600), 165Hz IPS LCD goodness. This display isn't likely to wow you at any point, but it's solid across the board and offers reliable, smooth performance when gaming. 99% of the sRGB and 78% of the DCI-P3 color gamuts means you shouldn't rely on this display for any creative work, but this display is consistent. It gets decently bright, its contrast ratios are good for an IPS LCD panel, and its white balance, while warm, is level across all brightness levels. Dolby Vision HDR support is also technically here, but this isn't a screen I'd rely on to consume high-quality HDR content. When gaming, this display is smooth and responsive, with NVIDIA G-SYNC support putting a halt to potential screen tearing. Performance is where you'll most wonder if you really need to spring for the more expensive Lenovo Legion Pro 5i, as the Legion 5i (Gen 9) boasts many of the same configuration options and is able to perform admirably with that hardware. Its only real flaw is that these fans are extremely loud, enough that the speakers aren't quite enough to drown them out. You'll want a headset for gaming. With the same CPU, GPU, RAM, SSD, and display options, it's hard at first glance to see the difference between the Lenovo Legion 5i (Gen 9) and its more expensive Pro sibling. Really, it comes down to the Pro 5i having more thermal headroom due to its beefier chassis and being able to put a little more wattage into its components. On paper, this means the Legion Pro 5i is the more powerful laptop, and this is reflected in benchmarks. That doesn't make the Legion 5i slow, though. This laptop kept up with more expensive machines well, and in real-world performance and gaming, you're not liable to see much of a difference between the Legion 5i and the thicker, heavier Legion Pro 5i, including in gaming. Achieving stable 60 frames-per-second in most PC games at high settings is very reasonable with the Legion Pro 5i, and if you lower the resolution to 1080p (which will still look great on a 16-inch display), you can take better advantage of that 165Hz refresh rate. I also stress tested the Legion 5i's thermal management with 25 consecutive loops of 3DMark's Time Spy benchmark, and a 99.6% framerate stability proves this laptop's capable cooling system. The Lenovo Legion 5i (Gen 9) carries the same 80Whr battery cell as the Legion Pro 5i and Slim 5i, and its endurance sits in between the two. Lower wattage likely contributes to the Legion 5i outlasting its Pro sibling, but it can't compete with the efficiency of the AMD-powered Slim 5i, which is one of the longest-lasting Legion laptops. In Procyon's One Hour Battery Consumption tests, the Legion 5i drained 22% while simulating a standard Microsoft Office workload and 24% when looping an HD video at 50% volume. Around 3-4 hours of regular usage isn't unreasonable with the Legion 5i, but this is still far from a battery champion and not a laptop I'd recommend for mobile work. Once again, the Legion 5i is a familiar tale here. Wholly focused on its role as a gaming laptop, the Lenovo Legion 5i (Gen 9) simply isn't exciting or interesting in a lot of ways. The front-facing camera, microphones, and touchpad are all secondary on a gaming laptop, so they clearly didn't get much investment. The dual stereo speakers are also reminiscent of the "average" Windows laptop of a few years ago in that they're fine for YouTube videos or video calls, but you won't want to do much else with them. One feature a gaming laptop can't neglect is the keyboard, though, and Lenovo rarely misses here. The Legion 5i shares a keyboard with its siblings, this time with four-zone RGB lighting and a condensed tenkey number pad. It's a very solid keyboard with a comfortable and responsive action, excellent layout, full-sized arrow keys, and intelligent shortcuts and functions. I really can't complain here. As usual, there's no Windows Hello biometric authentication, but I'm not really docking the Legion 5i points for that. This is a mid-range gaming laptop, I don't expect it. I do expect excellent wireless performance, though, and the Legion 5i fares just fine on this front with Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.2 support. If you want a more stable connection, you can always use the Ethernet port. It shouldn't surprise you if you've read this review up until this point, but the Lenovo Legion Pro 5i (Gen 9) that we've reviewed is arguably this laptop's biggest competitor. It's not because the Legion Pro 5i is necessarily better; it's more powerful, but it's also bigger, heavier, and more expensive. It's largely because the Legion Pro 5i is more available, and unless you can find a Legion 5i configuration in stock and on sale for less than the equivalent Legion Pro 5i, then the Legion Pro 5i may end up the easier choice. You can also consider the Lenovo Legion Slim 5i (Gen 9). We haven't reviewed this laptop, but it's very similar in size and weight to the Legion 5i but with a tweaked design and an AMD CPU that focuses more on efficiency than raw power. This is the Legion 5 to choose if you want a pure gaming laptop that can also fare okay away from the charger for a few hours. As far as this price range is concerned, though, Lenovo's Legion line is going to be one of the more attractive options, and for good reason. ✅You want a focused, no-fuss gaming laptop on a budget The Lenovo Legion 5i is designed for one thing and one thing only: to game. Sure, it's a full-blown Windows laptop and can do all the normal PC things, too, but it's clearly built for those who aren't too concerned about that (and want to save some money on a new rig). ✅You can find it on sale for less than the Legion Pro 5i The Legion 5i should cost less than the Legion Pro 5i, but its spotty availability and odd pricing don't guarantee it. If you can find the Legion 5i in the configuration you want for a good bit less than the equivalent Legion Pro 5i, the Legion 5i will end up being the better laptop for most people. ❌You want a gaming laptop you can also take on the go Lenovo Legion laptops aren't known for being particularly portable or efficient, and the Legion 5i is no exception. This is a beefy laptop with a short-lived battery. Those who want a more mobile machine that can still game are better off looking at something like the ASUS ROG Zephyrus line (you'll be paying more, though). The Lenovo Legion 5i (Gen 9) is a bit of an odd laptop. To be frank, it would be the most obvious recommendation of Lenovo's mid-range gaming laptop lineup between the Legion Slim 5i (which isn't really slim at all) and the Legion Pro 5i (which barely feels "pro"), if it weren't for it being oddly... Hard to find. • Indiana Jones for Xbox• Razer Freyja cushion• iBuyPower Slate desktop• Lenovo Yoga Slim 7i Lenovo's habit of overpricing its devices at retail (only to frequently discount them soon after launch) returns here, but the Legion 5i also suffers from seemingly lower visibility and availability than the more expensive Legion Pro 5i. That laptop is just as good, and you're basically gaining more weight and size in exchange for slightly better performance and cooling, but it's also usually a couple of hundred dollars more expensive. If you can find the Lenovo Legion 5i at a discounted price that settles it below where you can find the equivalent Legion 5i Pro, I honestly suggest saving that money and getting this laptop instead. It's a gaming laptop through and through and won't win any awards outside of playing your favorite PC games, but the Lenovo Legion 5i (Gen 9) is a good gaming laptop at an attractive price, or around $1,120.99 at Lenovo for the configuration I'd recommend. The mid-range option in Lenovo's mid-range gaming laptop family, the Legion 5i (Gen 9) goes toe-to-toe with the more expensive Legion Pro 5i more often than not, while also usually costing a fair deal less. The only problem? Lenovo and retailers are far more likely to show you the Legion Pro 5i instead.

Following the Federal Reserve adopting a more optimistic stance and Bitcoin hitting a historic $100,000 milestone, this week carries a handful of key earnings reports, inflation data, and some events that could set the tone for 2025. By week’s end, many will shift their focus to holiday celebrations, but for now, investors are keeping a watchful eye on developments in the stock market, eager to gauge how these signals might influence the trajectory of the markets heading into the new year. This week brings a few important earnings. On Monday, Oracle (ORCL+1.01%) Corporation will release its earnings after the closing bell, offering insights into the demand for corporate tech services. On Tuesday, GameStop (GME+9.73%) will take the spotlight with its earnings report, which is also scheduled for after the market close. Wednesday shifts focus to Adobe (ADBE+0.60%), which will reveal its financials at the end of the trading day. Thursday rounds out the week with a series of significant earnings announcements. AI giant Broadcom (AVGO+5.84%) will report its performance, offering clues about the health of the semiconductor and AI-driven technology markets. Retail powerhouse Costco (COST+0.80%) will also release its results, shedding light on consumer spending habits amid shifting economic conditions. This week, key inflation data will be released, providing important insights into the state of the U.S. economy. On Wednesday, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and core CPI data will be published, shedding light on inflationary trends and the cost of living. These reports are closely watched by economists and investors, as they help gauge the effectiveness of monetary policy. On Thursday, the market will receive initial jobless claims data, offering a snapshot of the labor market’s health, along with the Producer Price Index (PPI) and core PPI data. The PPI measures inflation at the wholesale level and provides an early indicator of potential price pressures in the broader economy. Finally, on Friday, the Import Price Index and U.S. retail sales figures will be released. The Import Price Index will highlight changes in the cost of goods imported into the U.S., while retail sales data will offer a look into consumer spending patterns, a key driver of economic growth. Microsoft (MSFT+1.39%) will determine on Tuesday whether to invest in Bitcoin, although the board has recommended voting against the proposal, citing that the company already considers a wide range of investable assets, including Bitcoin. The AI Summit kicks off in New York on Wednesday, bringing together industry leaders and innovators for two days of exploration into how artificial intelligence is transforming lives and reshaping various sectors. The event will feature keynote speakers from major tech giants such as Google (GOOGL+4.89%) and Meta (META+2.50%).

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks mostly rose on Friday as investors digested the last monthly jobs report of the year, a crucial test of the prospects for interest rate cuts in December and beyond. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) lost about 0.3%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose roughly 0.3%. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) increased 0.8% as Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), and Meta (META) gained, tapping all-time intraday highs. The daily results of the major gauges also reflected their weekly performances. The Dow shed 0.6% for the week, while the S&P 500 gained close to 1%. The Nasdaq climbed more than 3%. The US economy added 227,000 jobs in November, slightly more than expected, as the labor market rebounded from October data that was dinged by severe weather and labor strikes. The unemployment rate unexpectedly ticked up to 4.2%. Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer has all the details here. The report largely matched hopes for a "Goldilocks" reading — strong enough to dampen concerns about the economy but soft enough to keep the Fed's options open on lowering rates this month and into next year. On Friday, markets were pricing in near-90% odds the Fed lowers rates by a quarter percentage point on Dec. 18, per the CME FedWatch Tool, compared with about 70% before the report. Meanwhile, the rally in bitcoin (BTC-USD) continued after slipping, trading around $101,000 Friday afternoon. Options show some investors are hedging against a deeper pullback after the leading token's record-breaking surge to over $100,000 for the first time. The rally has been spurred by hopes of support for digital currencies from President-elect Donald Trump, who on Thursday named former PayPal (PYPL) COO David Sacks as his "White House AI & Crypto Czar." On the corporate front, shares of Lululemon (LULU) and Ulta Beauty (ULTA) jumped after the retailers both boosted profit forecasts. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy US stocks mostly rose on Friday and notched gains for the week as investors took the latest monthly jobs report as a sign that the Fed will likely cut interest rates again later this month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) lost about 0.3%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose roughly 0.3%. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) increased 0.8%, with several tech giants touching new highs. The daily results of the major gauges also reflected their weekly performances. The Dow shed 0.6% for the week, while the S&P 500 gained close to 1%. The Nasdaq climbed more than 3%. If Friday's labor market reading likely kept the Federal Reserve on track to cut interest rates later this month, next week's inflation reading is perhaps the final key data point that could alter that storyline. On Wednesday, a closely watched report on US inflation will give the Federal Reserve another glimpse into consumer prices before they are set to meet for their last policy huddle of the year. If the Consumer Price Index (CPI) surprises to the upside, that might pressure central bankers to halt their interest rate cutting. But as of Friday afternoon, Wall Street largely expects the Fed to cut rates by another quarter percentage. The economic calendar also includes wholesale inventories and the import price index. A handful of major corporate names are set to deliver earnings reports next week. Among the tickers are GameStop (GME), Macy's (M), Costco (COST), and Broadcom (AVGO). Yahoo Finance's Brent Sanchez has a graphical breakdown of what to watch next week: TikTok's loss is Meta (META)'s gain. Shares of Facebook's parent company rose nearly 3% Friday afternoon following a US appeals court decision that upheld a law banning TikTok from operating in the US under Chinese ownership. The decision, which could be overturned by the Supreme Court, increases the likelihood that the short-form video app will be banned in the US. That would seriously diminish a rising competitor to American social media and digital advertising platforms. The stocks of several US tech giants rose on the news. Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), the corporate parent of Google and YouTube, gained 1%. TikTok's future isn't set, however. In addition to the legal challenges that ByteDance could pursue, there is also the unknown of what resident-elect Trump could do. As Yahoo Finance's Alexis Keenan reports, his statements on the campaign trail suggest he may at least try to tinker with the impact of the law. Here are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance’s trending tickers page during afternoon trading on Friday: Lululemon (LULU): Shares of the athletic apparel company soared Friday afternoon on the back of strong third quarter results. Lululemon raised its full-year revenue forecast after beating estimates across the top and bottom line, thanks in large part to the brand's strength in international markets. Palantir (PLTR): The big data analytics company rose more than 5% Friday after signing a new AI partnership with defense contractor Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH). Palantir is up more than 300% so far this year, riding the momentum of advancements in AI technology. Shopify (SHOP): Shares of the e-commerce platform gained 5% Friday following an upgrade from Loop Capital from a Hold to a Buy, nodding to the company's use of AI. Loop raised its price target to $140, reflecting a 23% potential upside to the stock. Ulta Beauty (ULTA): The cosmetic store chain is rallying after the company beat third quarter earnings estimates Thursday and as executives raised their forecasts for full-year earnings. Net sales for the quarter increased by 1.7% to $2.5 billion. Shares rose 10% Friday afternoon. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) shot up above $101,000 at around 1:10 p.m. ET on Friday after falling below the $100,000 milestone level. On Thursday evening President-elect Donald Trump announced venture capitalist David Sacks will be his incoming administration's "AI and crypto czar." Bitcoin reached new highs late Wednesday, surpassing $100,000 for the first time following Trump’s nomination of Paul Atkins to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission. Atkins is seen as a crypto-friendly pick for the position. The token cleared $103,000 after Trump took to his social media platform Truth Social early Thursday to cheer the recent all-time highs, telling crypto enthusiasts that they are welcome for the rally that has followed his election win last month. "CONGRATULATIONS BITCOINERS!!! $100,000!!! YOU'RE WELCOME!!!" Trump wrote. "Together, we will Make America Great Again!" A jobs report that largely matched hopes for a "Goldilocks" reading sent stocks higher in afternoon trading Friday as investors digested a crucial test of the prospects for interest rate cuts in December and beyond. Several Big Tech names also hit intraday highs, including Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), and Meta (META). The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was the outlier among the major indexes, shedding about 0.1%. But the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.2% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) increased roughly 0.6%. A US federal appeals court upheld a new law that outlaws TikTok from operating in the US under Chinese ownership, reports Yahoo Finance's Alexis Keenan. The plan could still be altered by the Supreme Court or affected by President-elect Donald Trump, who in September suggested in a social media post that he would "save TikTok" and prevent federal law enforcement from shuttering the app. The law, called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (PAFACAA), gives TikTok’s Chinese owner, ByteDance, an ultimatum to either sell TikTok to a US owner by Jan. 19, 2025, or have it banned from operations in the country. TikTok challenged the law by arguing it violated the US Constitution in taking away the First Amendment rights of TikTok's US entity and its users. But a panel of three judges from the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit concluded that the government's law withstood constitutional scrutiny by protecting free speech in the US "from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary's ability to gather data on people in the United States." Read about the latest on the government's effort to ban TikTok under Chinese ownership here. A labor market rebound announced Friday is likely to keep the Federal Reserve on track to cut interest rates by another quarter percentage point later this month, absent any upside surprises to inflation, reports Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger. "For the Fed, this doesn't change the narrative," Robert Sockin, Citigroup's senior chief economist, told Yahoo Finance. The new jobs numbers are "right in the spot of what they were looking for and they are comfortable with to continue easing policy" at the last meeting of the year, on Dec. 17-18. Traders boosted the odds of a rate cut at that meeting to 91% following the data release. But Fed watchers agreed that the robust jobs picture and recent stickiness in inflation reinforce a mounting conviction that the pace of rate cuts in 2025 will be less aggressive than once expected. Read about how the latest labor market readings will steer the Federal Reserve's next policy decision here. Consumers are growing more concerned about the path forward for inflation over the next year. The latest consumer sentiment survey from the University of Michigan revealed that consumers expect inflation to hit 2.9% in a year, an increase from last month's expectation of 2.6%. December's reading is the highest in six months but within the 2.3% to 3% range seen in the two years before the pandemic. Expectations for long-run inflation slipped higher, though, falling to 3.1% from 3.2% the month prior. The overall consumer sentiment index popped to a reading of 74, up from 71.8 in November. Overall, consumer views on inflation varied based on political party, Surveys of Consumers Director Joanne Hsu noted. "Democrats voiced concerns that anticipated policy changes, particularly tariff hikes, would lead to a resurgence in inflation," Hsu said in the release. "Republicans disagreed; they expect the next president will usher in an immense slowdown in inflation." Also in this month's data, the survey showed a large increase in buying conditions for durable goods, which boosted current economic conditions by more than 20%. "Rather than a sign of strength, this rise in durables was primarily due to a perception that purchasing durables now would enable buyers to avoid future price increases," Hsu said. A jobs report that largely matched hopes for a "Goldilocks" reading sent stocks higher as investors digested a crucial test of the prospects for interest rate cuts in December and beyond.
