Following the Federal Reserve adopting a more optimistic stance and Bitcoin hitting a historic $100,000 milestone, this week carries a handful of key earnings reports, inflation data, and some events that could set the tone for 2025. By week’s end, many will shift their focus to holiday celebrations, but for now, investors are keeping a watchful eye on developments in the stock market, eager to gauge how these signals might influence the trajectory of the markets heading into the new year. This week brings a few important earnings. On Monday, Oracle (ORCL-0.45%) Corporation will release its earnings after the closing bell, offering insights into the demand for corporate tech services. On Tuesday, GameStop (GME+2.08%) will take the spotlight with its earnings report, which is also scheduled for after the market close. Wednesday shifts focus to Adobe (ADBE-0.31%), which will reveal its financials at the end of the trading day. Thursday rounds out the week with a series of significant earnings announcements. AI giant Broadcom (AVGO-1.17%) will report its performance, offering clues about the health of the semiconductor and AI-driven technology markets. Retail powerhouse Costco (COST-0.97%) will also release its results, shedding light on consumer spending habits amid shifting economic conditions. This week, key inflation data will be released, providing important insights into the state of the U.S. economy. On Wednesday, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and core CPI data will be published, shedding light on inflationary trends and the cost of living. These reports are closely watched by economists and investors, as they help gauge the effectiveness of monetary policy. On Thursday, the market will receive initial jobless claims data, offering a snapshot of the labor market’s health, along with the Producer Price Index (PPI) and core PPI data. The PPI measures inflation at the wholesale level and provides an early indicator of potential price pressures in the broader economy. Finally, on Friday, the Import Price Index and U.S. retail sales figures will be released. The Import Price Index will highlight changes in the cost of goods imported into the U.S., while retail sales data will offer a look into consumer spending patterns, a key driver of economic growth. Microsoft (MSFT+0.71%) will determine on Tuesday whether to invest in Bitcoin, although the board has recommended voting against the proposal, citing that the company already considers a wide range of investable assets, including Bitcoin. The AI Summit kicks off in New York on Wednesday, bringing together industry leaders and innovators for two days of exploration into how artificial intelligence is transforming lives and reshaping various sectors. The event will feature keynote speakers from major tech giants such as Google (GOOGL+0.76%) and Meta (META-2.16%). Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks mostly rose on Friday as investors digested the last monthly jobs report of the year, a crucial test of the prospects for interest rate cuts in December and beyond. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) lost about 0.3%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose roughly 0.3%. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) increased 0.8% as Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), and Meta (META) gained, tapping all-time intraday highs. The daily results of the major gauges also reflected their weekly performances. The Dow shed 0.6% for the week, while the S&P 500 gained close to 1%. The Nasdaq climbed more than 3%. The US economy added 227,000 jobs in November, slightly more than expected, as the labor market rebounded from October data that was dinged by severe weather and labor strikes. The unemployment rate unexpectedly ticked up to 4.2%. Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer has all the details here. The report largely matched hopes for a "Goldilocks" reading — strong enough to dampen concerns about the economy but soft enough to keep the Fed's options open on lowering rates this month and into next year. On Friday, markets were pricing in near-90% odds the Fed lowers rates by a quarter percentage point on Dec. 18, per the CME FedWatch Tool, compared with about 70% before the report. Meanwhile, the rally in bitcoin (BTC-USD) continued after slipping, trading around $101,000 Friday afternoon. Options show some investors are hedging against a deeper pullback after the leading token's record-breaking surge to over $100,000 for the first time. The rally has been spurred by hopes of support for digital currencies from President-elect Donald Trump, who on Thursday named former PayPal (PYPL) COO David Sacks as his "White House AI & Crypto Czar." On the corporate front, shares of Lululemon (LULU) and Ulta Beauty (ULTA) jumped after the retailers both boosted profit forecasts. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy US stocks mostly rose on Friday and notched gains for the week as investors took the latest monthly jobs report as a sign that the Fed will likely cut interest rates again later this month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) lost about 0.3%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose roughly 0.3%. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) increased 0.8%, with several tech giants touching new highs. The daily results of the major gauges also reflected their weekly performances. The Dow shed 0.6% for the week, while the S&P 500 gained close to 1%. The Nasdaq climbed more than 3%. If Friday's labor market reading likely kept the Federal Reserve on track to cut interest rates later this month, next week's inflation reading is perhaps the final key data point that could alter that storyline. On Wednesday, a closely watched report on US inflation will give the Federal Reserve another glimpse into consumer prices before they are set to meet for their last policy huddle of the year. If the Consumer Price Index (CPI) surprises to the upside, that might pressure central bankers to halt their interest rate cutting. But as of Friday afternoon, Wall Street largely expects the Fed to cut rates by another quarter percentage. The economic calendar also includes wholesale inventories and the import price index. A handful of major corporate names are set to deliver earnings reports next week. Among the tickers are GameStop (GME), Macy's (M), Costco (COST), and Broadcom (AVGO). Yahoo Finance's Brent Sanchez has a graphical breakdown of what to watch next week: TikTok's loss is Meta (META)'s gain. Shares of Facebook's parent company rose nearly 3% Friday afternoon following a US appeals court decision that upheld a law banning TikTok from operating in the US under Chinese ownership. The decision, which could be overturned by the Supreme Court, increases the likelihood that the short-form video app will be banned in the US. That would seriously diminish a rising competitor to American social media and digital advertising platforms. The stocks of several US tech giants rose on the news. Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), the corporate parent of Google and YouTube, gained 1%. TikTok's future isn't set, however. In addition to the legal challenges that ByteDance could pursue, there is also the unknown of what resident-elect Trump could do. As Yahoo Finance's Alexis Keenan reports, his statements on the campaign trail suggest he may at least try to tinker with the impact of the law. Here are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance’s trending tickers page during afternoon trading on Friday: Lululemon (LULU): Shares of the athletic apparel company soared Friday afternoon on the back of strong third quarter results. Lululemon raised its full-year revenue forecast after beating estimates across the top and bottom line, thanks in large part to the brand's strength in international markets. Palantir (PLTR): The big data analytics company rose more than 5% Friday after signing a new AI partnership with defense contractor Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH). Palantir is up more than 300% so far this year, riding the momentum of advancements in AI technology. Shopify (SHOP): Shares of the e-commerce platform gained 5% Friday following an upgrade from Loop Capital from a Hold to a Buy, nodding to the company's use of AI. Loop raised its price target to $140, reflecting a 23% potential upside to the stock. Ulta Beauty (ULTA): The cosmetic store chain is rallying after the company beat third quarter earnings estimates Thursday and as executives raised their forecasts for full-year earnings. Net sales for the quarter increased by 1.7% to $2.5 billion. Shares rose 10% Friday afternoon. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) shot up above $101,000 at around 1:10 p.m. ET on Friday after falling below the $100,000 milestone level. On Thursday evening President-elect Donald Trump announced venture capitalist David Sacks will be his incoming administration's "AI and crypto czar." Bitcoin reached new highs late Wednesday, surpassing $100,000 for the first time following Trump’s nomination of Paul Atkins to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission. Atkins is seen as a crypto-friendly pick for the position. The token cleared $103,000 after Trump took to his social media platform Truth Social early Thursday to cheer the recent all-time highs, telling crypto enthusiasts that they are welcome for the rally that has followed his election win last month. "CONGRATULATIONS BITCOINERS!!! $100,000!!! YOU'RE WELCOME!!!" Trump wrote. "Together, we will Make America Great Again!" A jobs report that largely matched hopes for a "Goldilocks" reading sent stocks higher in afternoon trading Friday as investors digested a crucial test of the prospects for interest rate cuts in December and beyond. Several Big Tech names also hit intraday highs, including Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), and Meta (META). The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was the outlier among the major indexes, shedding about 0.1%. But the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.2% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) increased roughly 0.6%. A US federal appeals court upheld a new law that outlaws TikTok from operating in the US under Chinese ownership, reports Yahoo Finance's Alexis Keenan. The plan could still be altered by the Supreme Court or affected by President-elect Donald Trump, who in September suggested in a social media post that he would "save TikTok" and prevent federal law enforcement from shuttering the app. The law, called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (PAFACAA), gives TikTok’s Chinese owner, ByteDance, an ultimatum to either sell TikTok to a US owner by Jan. 19, 2025, or have it banned from operations in the country. TikTok challenged the law by arguing it violated the US Constitution in taking away the First Amendment rights of TikTok's US entity and its users. But a panel of three judges from the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit concluded that the government's law withstood constitutional scrutiny by protecting free speech in the US "from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary's ability to gather data on people in the United States." Read about the latest on the government's effort to ban TikTok under Chinese ownership here. A labor market rebound announced Friday is likely to keep the Federal Reserve on track to cut interest rates by another quarter percentage point later this month, absent any upside surprises to inflation, reports Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger. "For the Fed, this doesn't change the narrative," Robert Sockin, Citigroup's senior chief economist, told Yahoo Finance. The new jobs numbers are "right in the spot of what they were looking for and they are comfortable with to continue easing policy" at the last meeting of the year, on Dec. 17-18. Traders boosted the odds of a rate cut at that meeting to 91% following the data release. But Fed watchers agreed that the robust jobs picture and recent stickiness in inflation reinforce a mounting conviction that the pace of rate cuts in 2025 will be less aggressive than once expected. Read about how the latest labor market readings will steer the Federal Reserve's next policy decision here. Consumers are growing more concerned about the path forward for inflation over the next year. The latest consumer sentiment survey from the University of Michigan revealed that consumers expect inflation to hit 2.9% in a year, an increase from last month's expectation of 2.6%. December's reading is the highest in six months but within the 2.3% to 3% range seen in the two years before the pandemic. Expectations for long-run inflation slipped higher, though, falling to 3.1% from 3.2% the month prior. The overall consumer sentiment index popped to a reading of 74, up from 71.8 in November. Overall, consumer views on inflation varied based on political party, Surveys of Consumers Director Joanne Hsu noted. "Democrats voiced concerns that anticipated policy changes, particularly tariff hikes, would lead to a resurgence in inflation," Hsu said in the release. "Republicans disagreed; they expect the next president will usher in an immense slowdown in inflation." Also in this month's data, the survey showed a large increase in buying conditions for durable goods, which boosted current economic conditions by more than 20%. "Rather than a sign of strength, this rise in durables was primarily due to a perception that purchasing durables now would enable buyers to avoid future price increases," Hsu said. A jobs report that largely matched hopes for a "Goldilocks" reading sent stocks higher as investors digested a crucial test of the prospects for interest rate cuts in December and beyond. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained about 0.3% and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.2% after the gauges drifted away from all-time highs at Thursday's close. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) increased roughly 0.3%. The US economy added 227,000 jobs in November, slightly more than expected, as the labor market rebounded from October data that was dinged by severe weather and labor strikes. The unemployment rate unexpectedly ticked up to 4.2%. The US labor market rebounded from an October swoon, adding more jobs than expected in November, while the unemployment rate ticked higher to 4.2%.

Title: Costco (COST) Pre-Earnings: Why This Retail Giant Is Poised to Keep Climbing

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Costco (COST) is scheduled to report its Fiscal Q1 results on December 12th, after the closing bell. The wholesale giant has been one of the most successful retail stocks of 2024 and has maintained strong performance for several years. As earnings day approaches, I see no reason for this trend to be interrupted. To be clear, my bullish outlook on COST is rooted in fundamental factors such as its steady, profitable membership-based model—a rare advantage for a non-tech company—and its ability to weather periods of economic softness better than most retailers. Unlock your investing potential with TipRanks Premium - Now At 40% OFF! Make smarter investments with weekly expert stock picks from the Smart Investor Newsletter In this article, I’ll provide a recap of Costco’s recent performance, highlight what might stand out in Fiscal Q1, and explain why, despite its relatively high valuation, I believe Costco is well-positioned to continue its upward trajectory. In early September, Costco released its Fiscal Q4 results. While the company’s top-line performance fell short of market expectations, its strong profitability results helped justify the bullish outlook. Costco’s net sales for the quarter totaled $78.2 billion, a 1% increase year-over-year, but came in below the $79.91 billion expected by analysts. This miss was primarily due to membership fees, which reached $1.51 billion, reflecting a 6.5% year-over-year increase. Although there was a slight decline in renewal rates in the U.S. and Canada—falling to 92.5% from 93% in Q4—this was attributed to an online promotion that brought in about 2,000 new users, leading to the small drop in membership renewals. Despite this, Costco’s bullish momentum remained intact. While the top line missed expectations, the bottom line exceeded them significantly. Costco reported non-GAAP EPS of $5.29 per share, outperforming analyst estimates of $5.07, marking an 8.8% year-over-year increase. Given that Costco has managed to grow its bottom line faster than its revenue and has increased membership fees for the first time since 2017, this should contribute to higher profitability in Q1. As a result, the positive trend is expected to continue in the coming quarters. Looking ahead to Costco’s upcoming Fiscal Q1 results, I believe that the favorable outlook should hold if the company continues to report membership increases, which is arguably the main driving force behind the company’s investment thesis. To begin with, Costco registered 76.2 million paid memberships in Fiscal Q4, growing at 7.3% year-over-year. This was a very similar growth rate to Q3 when it registered an increase of 7.8%. It is worth noting that over half of Costco’s profitability depends on membership fees. Indeed, the firm generated $4.82 billion in memberships that were essentially pure profit. Given that Costco’s total operating income is $9.29 billion, I believe that profitability will continue to rise if memberships keep growing. And speaking of profitability, the numbers that Costco has to beat in Q1 are earnings of $3.78 per share on revenue of $62.38 billion, which equate to year-over-year growth rates of 5.6% and 7.83%, respectively. Interestingly, Costco reported a 6.9% growth in adjusted comparable sales during the last quarter, which was probably the best market share gain in the consumer staples industry. I believe this proves that Costco’s value offering does very well in all environments where value-seeking increases. And I see no reason not to believe that the trend of strong sales comps shouldn’t also prove strong in Fiscal Q1, thus sustaining organic growth and maintaining operational efficiency. As is often the case, the primary risk to Costco’s bullish thesis remains well-known to investors: the stock tends to trade at a significant premium compared to most of its peers. Currently, Costco trades at a 54.6x forward P/E ratio, a valuation that can largely be attributed to qualitative factors such as strong management, high customer loyalty, and the company’s business model. Given that much of Costco’s profitability stems from a hyper-loyal network of members who pay a fee, there is a general consensus that the company’s financial performance will remain robust regardless of the consumer environment, which reduces the perceived risk for investors. However, the high valuation raises concerns for many investors. Paying 54 times earnings for a company may seem excessive, even if Costco can manage to grow its earnings by 10% annually. At that growth rate, it would still take roughly 20 years to recoup the investment at this valuation—a lengthy period for a consumer staples and discretionary business. As Costco heads into Fiscal Q1, this is clearly not an opportunity to capitalize on any weakness, given that the stock is trading at all-time highs. This, understandably, raises concerns for investors about whether they’re overpaying for the stock. While COST may be vulnerable to short-term pressure if minor setbacks occur, such as a dip in membership growth or slower sales, any corrections would likely be a response to stretched valuations. That said, in the long-term, as long as Costco maintains its current business model—particularly with membership fees contributing more than half of its profits and with renewal rates consistently above 90%—I believe that the stock will continue to trend upward. At TipRanks, the consensus among Wall Street analysts for COST is a Moderate Buy, with 18 out of 26 analysts being bullish on the stock, while eight remain neutral. The average price target is $957, which implies a downside risk of -3.42% based on the latest share price. See more COST analyst ratings I rate Costco stock as a Buy heading into its Fiscal Q1 earnings, although I acknowledge that any potential hiccups in comparable sales, revenue growth, or membership renewal rates could put pressure on the stock, given its stretched valuation. However, I don’t believe such pressure would have a lasting effect beyond the short term. While Costco’s stock may appear to have limited upside at its current valuation, even with favorable results, it remains a solid defensive pick for long-term investors. The company’s business model—built on high volume, low margins, and strong membership retention—drives steady profit growth across various consumer environments. This should support the stock’s upward trajectory and push it to new highs over time. Disclosure Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: Costco's Combo Of Strong Loyalty, Unmatched Value Is Rare In Retail: Analyst

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. On Thursday, JP Morgan analyst Christopher Horvers raised the price target on Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) to $1,090 (from $945 prior) while maintaining an Overweight rating following November sales results. The company reported net sales of $21.87 billion for the retail month of November (four weeks ending December 1, 2024), reflecting a 5.6% increase from $20.71 billion last year. For the twelve-week first quarter ending November 24, 2024, net sales reached $60.99 billion, up 7.5% from $56.72 billion last year. Net sales for the first thirteen weeks totaled $66.52 billion, an increase of 7.2% compared to $62.04 billion in the prior year. E-commerce sales in November were down by an estimated 15 percentage points due to the later timing of Thanksgiving, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday this year compared to last year. This shift resulted in a roughly 1.5% decrease in total and comparable sales. The analyst writes that they continue to believe that COST remains a core holding due to its unmatched value proposition, characterized by 11% gross margins, a loyal customer base with a ~90% renewal rate, and a global growth opportunity of 2%-3% annually. The analyst adds that this combination is rare in retail and consumer staples, with the potential to double its current store base. The latter is its GICS classification. The analyst adds that Costco continues to outperform most of retail in terms of share gains and traffic trends, particularly due to its 70% consumable assortment. For December, the analyst expects core U.S. comps to be +6.7%, Canada to +8.2%, and Other International to +9.0%, resulting in a total company core comp of +7.2%. Investors can gain exposure to the stock via Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF (NYSE:VDC) and Fidelity MSCI Consumer Staples Index ETF (NYSE:FSTA). Price Action: COST shares are down 0.49% at $986.06 at the last check Thursday.
