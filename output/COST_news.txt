Beef prices are going up. Per recent reporting from Fox Business, industry leaders anticipate a top cost of $10 per pound by 2026. Yet, people's craving and appreciation for steak isn't going anywhere. Rather than heading out to a steakhouse (where business is, admittedly, also booming), many consumers are looking to their local grocery stores for steaks to prepare at home. It's easy to walk into a grocery store and find a full list of different cuts of steak, but what's less straightforward is assessing quality while shopping. Truth be told, some grocery stores are better to buy steak from than others. When compiling this guide to steak quality by grocery chains, we identified the in-house steaks brands each grocery chain sources and sells as private label items. Beef or meat brands with larger footprints (take Tyson, for example) didn't factor in very heavily. We also took into consideration whether or not a chain has significant offerings from local or small-scale beef producers as well. Mostly, this guide centers on how shoppers feel about these private label steaks from popular grocery chains. Kicking off our list of best grocery store steak selections is the one and only: Kroger. Synonymous with Midwestern groceries, Kroger is the go-to store for a large portion of the American population. Luckily, it's also home to one of the highest-quality lines of steak from any grocery chain — the Kroger Simple Truth and Simple Truth Organic line. Simple Truth, one of the store's private labels, uses beef sourced from Uruguay, which has a more favorable climate for grass-fed and finished cows to graze on year-round. With Simple Truth, the livestock has a diet that is almost exclusively grass. Kroger refrains from using beef where hormones or antibiotics have been administered, resulting in natural meat without sacrificing flavor. In Uruguay, much of the cattle are Aberdeen Angus or Hereford cows. The latter is a hardy breed, while the former is known for superior marbling. You can widely see the difference in the quality of product Kroger sells. Although the reviews on its in-house branded steaks are mixed depending on the store, the Private Selection is reviewed well across the board, reaching at least three and a half stars on each steak (with many rated between four and five stars). The chain offers a variety of different cuts, including choice beef shoulder steak, top round London broil beef steak, beef choice skirt steak, sirloin tip beef, choice tailless beef strip steak, T-bone steak, eye of round beef steak, and cubed beef steak. It may not be the very best steak available in grocery stores, but it's well above most others and is deserving of a try next time you find yourself in one of the many Kroger locations. Trader Joe's, known for its eclectic inventory and cheap pricing, is also home to some of the best-quality steaks you'll find in grocery stores. Although the cuts Trader Joe's has carried have always contained a solid amount of USDA Choice graded slabs, it has updated its selection to be even better. As of 2025, its stock has been updated to include filet mignon, ribeye, and New York strip steaks (all of which are graded as the second-highest grade for meat possible: Choice). The store also offers selections between pure pre-packaged cuts, organic grass-fed angus, and pre-marinated cuts (including, but not limited to, craft beer sirloin, carne asada, balsamic rosemary, and sesame teriyaki). It give the meat selection a versatility no matter what the meal you're making, with options that can fit many styles of cooking. While it may not have quite as high a quality as a store like Costco (which has its own processing and packaging process), for the value and size of steaks that Trader Joe's offers, it's one of the best deals on steak in any grocery store. According to shoppers, the lean tenderness of filet mignon and craft beer sirloin are the best options, as they both have solid five-star reviews. Shoppers in the Reddit group r/traderjoes agree that the store's steak is better than most other grocers. While steak may not be the first thing you think of when hearing of Trader Joe's, it should absolutely be one of the first things you put in your cart on your next visit. Publix grocery store (found primarily in the southeast) makes a comittment to supporting local farmers, and regularly procures meat from regional ranches. Sources are found from beef purveyors like Prestage Farm of North Carolina, and White Oak Pastures in Bluffton, Georgia. Nationally, it receives beef from Verde Farms, a regenerative farming-focused operation, which emphasizes environmental preservation and humane treatment of livestock. The store's meat counters are regularly stocked with a multitude of USDA Choice-graded cuts. The quality comes through in the house brand, GreenWise private label, and the line of meat sold under it. The animals raised for the GreenWise program are fed exclusively vegetarian diets, with no added hormones or antibiotics, resulting in more succulent meats packed with flavor. This, in large part, is due to its local sourcing, as Although the brand sells a variety of meats, including different kinds and variations of chicken, turkey, pork, and lamb, the steak is the clear standout, as its flavor is consistently second-to-none. While the store's website doesn't offer customer reviews for its particular products, the Reddit group r/publix concurs that the steak is of better quality than similar stores, and the store itself largely receives high ratings on Yelp. While Costco is generally known as a place to get bulk items for much cheaper prices, it has some departments that stand out for consistently having quality items (such as whiskies) that some customers go specifically to find. Its meat selection, particularly its steaks, fits perfectly in this category, as customers are always treated to a wide selection of high-quality cuts. USDA Prime (the highest quality beef can achieve) cuts are abundant and are defined by more marbling, tenderness, and flavor than USDA Choice or Select. While Costco sources its veal from Atlantic Veal and Lamb of New York (a source from more than 100 American farms), its beef primarily comes from California farmers in the San Joaquin Valley. It also sources from Iowa Premium and Snake River Farms, the former of which sources from over 1,200 local farmers, and the latter provides quality wagyu beef. Costco does not stock organic beef that's been fed hormones and/or antibiotics, but this isn't the biggest driver of their meat. The store uses a blade tenderizer when working its steaks, which (aside from a more thorough tenderization) severs the muscle and tissue more cleanly than other processes. This creates cleaner and better quality cuts, which leads to better quality steaks (even if they source their beef from similar places as their competitors) that are consistently rated four stars or more by their customers. One of the more common grocery stores in America, Meijer offers a high-quality steak selection to a wide customer base. The chain sources its meats from Certified Angus Beef, Purely Meat, Grass Run Farms, Niman Ranch, Pre Brands, and other regional-based distributors, which has led to consistently well-reviewed cuts by their customers. When visiting the website, almost every cut of steak has a rating of four stars or higher (out of five). Both Certified Angus Beef and Purely Meat are major factors in the higher quality of Meijer's steaks, as the latter helped not only to keep operations moving during COVID-19 (when many other suppliers were shut down), but to raise the overall quality of the meat the store carries. As of today, the store carries some of the most consistently highly rated steaks of any grocer. With there being Meijer locations across the country, you can't go wrong stopping in for some sincerely splendid slabs of steak. Known for its cheap prices compared to its competitors, Aldi doesn't let this keep it from stocking its shelves with quality products. Aldi steak, for example, comes in multiple delicious cuts that can be found for noticeably cheaper than similar cuts at other stores. This isn't because its beef is of worse quality, but that Aldi has carved out a way to obtain and package meat that goes around the issues their competitors face. For example, per Daily Meal rather than sourcing all its meat for stores from one or a small few places, Aldi opts to obtain meat from local farms and distributors. Doing so helps to avoid the costs that go along with shipping, as well as to avoid any added preservatives. The store also stocks private-label products for a large portion of its meat selection, which means it orders meat from a third-party source and sells it under its own name. This helps to reduce costs for things such as marketing, paying an in-house butcher, and (again) shipping and the maintenance associated with it, as well as allowing more specificity when placing orders. Although Aldi's lower meat prices can cause skepticism over the quality of its products, its steak is not to be missed. Despite the store not providing direct customer feedback for individual items on its site, its steak is regularly considered to be high quality by shoppers (despite its lower price tag). Some on Reddit have even called the marbling of Aldi steak "supreme." Sprouts is the banner holder of a more uniquely granola-type of grocery store, and that brings in many shoppers, who choose it religiously. Although all its food is high quality, the steak selection is the best of any grocery store in America. It sources its steak from Grass Run Farms, which provides grass-fed Angus steaks that are more marbled and succulent than your typical grocer's in-house steaks. Sprouts offers a selection of grass-fed, pasture-raised, and pre-prepared/ready-to-cook varieties, while emphasizing fresh, not frozen, meat, and a butcher counter that can assist with any questions or requests that you may have. Sprouts ranked as Tasting Table's top grocery store for meat for a reason, as the care to both source the best meat and provide the best cuts to its customers has resulted in the best overall selection of any grocery store. We've even recommended that Sprouts be your go-to for all meats, not just steak, which lends to the overall quality of the store. Its selections include a variety of cuts for whatever you may be making, including from the chuck/brisket/shank, the ribs/plate, the loin/flank, and the round/top round. While there is a bit more effort required to acquire a cut of steak from Sprouts (due to the higher pricing and lack of store presence outside the Southern states), it's well worth it, as these are some of the best cuts available in grocery stores today and have an overwhelming majority of five-star reviews on most of their in-house steaks. Each selection on this list has to be the store's own brand or label, and not products that can specifically be found in other stores. So while stores may source from the same suppliers, each store has its own processing/packaging processes that contribute to the varying qualities between different stores. They also had to be generally well reviewed by customers, so if a store has one or two cuts of steaks that are highly rated, but most are rated three stars or less, then it would not be included. Conversely, if a store has certain cuts that have been occasionally rated negatively, but that are widely well reviewed by customers, it isn't entirely discounted from being included. As mentioned, each store has its own processes for steak procurement and processing, which will lead to the inevitable missteps from time to time. The stores included in this list were ranked based on where and how they source meats, overall customer reviews, and (when necessary) value provided to the customer compared to competitors.

Title: Low Fat Cheese Market to Worth Over US$ 160.1 Billion by 2033 | Astute Analytica

November 24, 2025 08:30 ET | Source: AstuteAnalytica India Pvt. Ltd. AstuteAnalytica India Pvt. Ltd. Chicago, Nov. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The global low fat cheese market was valued at US$ 121.6 billion in 2024 and is expected to reach US$ 160.1 billion by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 3.1% from 2025–2033. Stakeholders in the low fat cheese market must recognize that vague health claims no longer satisfy consumers; specific nutrient density is the new currency. For instance, Babybel Light has set a strict calorie-controlled benchmark with exactly 50 calories per piece, while Sargento Reduced Fat Sharp Cheddar directly addresses lipid concerns by delivering just 5 grams of fat per serving. Concurrently, protein maximization is reshaping formulation strategies, evidenced by Arla Protein Lite Cheddar slices offering a substantial 20 grams of protein per serving. Similarly, Horizon Organic Lowfat Cottage Cheese provides a robust 14 grams of protein per half-cup serving. Arla’s innovation extends further, boasting 40% less fat than standard cheddar, proving that consumers demand high functionality without dietary compromise. Request Sample Pages: https://www.astuteanalytica.com/request-sample/low-fat-cheese-market Beyond macronutrients, sodium reduction has become a precise science within the low fat cheese market. Standard Swiss cheese naturally leads with a low 53 milligrams of sodium per ounce, setting a high bar for processed alternatives. In the cooking segment, Ricotta cheese averages 123 milligrams of sodium per half-cup serving, whereas newer low-salt white cheese formulations in 2024 have reached 400 milligrams of sodium per 30-gram serving. Manufacturers like Sargento are also fortifying these reduced-fat matrices with Vitamin A Palmitate to restore lost nutritional density. These meticulous specifications highlight a shift where every milligram counts in the consumer's decision-making process. Key Findings in Low Fat Cheese Market Global Production Capabilities are Shaping Supply Chain Availability Supply volume acts as the backbone of the growing low fat cheese market, with global cheese production forecast to reach a massive 22.55 million metric tons in the 2024/2025 marketing year. Within the United States, total cheese production was projected to hit 6.55 million metric tons in 2024, providing ample base material for nutritional modification. Specifically, Italian-type cheese production—critical for low-fat mozzarella variants—totaled 499 million pounds in August 2024 alone. Notably, US Mozzarella production accounts for 79.5% of the total Italian cheese category, significantly outpacing American-type cheese production, which totaled 478 million pounds in the same month. Regional production hubs in the low fat cheese market are adjusting their outputs to feed this global appetite. Australia's cheese production is projected to reach 435,000 metric tons in 2024, while New Zealand produced 400,000 tons in the 2023/2024 cycle to meet export needs. Domestically, US per capita cheese consumption reached nearly 42 pounds per person in the 2024 reporting cycle, signaling robust demand. Trends indicate that Mozzarella sticks will see the fastest segment growth through 2034, while Ricotta cheese held the largest product segment share in 2024. Such volume data confirms that the market is supported by a highly active global production network. Inventory Deficits Signal Tightening Conditions For Market Stakeholders Recent data suggests a tightening of supply that could increase urgency within the low fat cheese market. US natural cheese stocks in cold storage dropped by 33 million pounds in September 2024, a significant contraction relative to expectations. Furthermore, the US$A revised its August 2024 stock figures downward by 6.6 million pounds, compounding the deficit. American cheese stocks specifically fell by 29 million pounds in September 2024. These reductions imply that demand is outpacing immediate storage capabilities, creating potential pinch points for retailers seeking consistent inventory flow. However, contrasting inventory signals present a complex landscape for buyers. Total butter stocks exceeded forecasts by 7 million pounds in September 2024, creating a divergence between fat and protein commodities. Forward-looking projections for December 2024 showed a potential 19 million pound surplus in cheese stocks, suggesting relief may be on the horizon. In related protein sectors, pork bellies stocks dropped 25% in August 2024, while overall US natural cheese supplies ended August 2024 1% lower than the previous month. Stakeholders in the low fat cheese market must navigate these mixed inventory signals to optimize procurement strategies. Volatile Wholesale Costs are Directly Influencing Retail Margin Structures Fluctuations in raw material costs are currently dictating the profitability of the low fat cheese market. On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Cheddar block prices traded at US$ 1.79 per pound for the week ending November 15, 2025, showing distinct volatility compared to the US$ 1.50 per pound recorded in January 2024. Meanwhile, Cheddar barrel prices reached US$ 2.005 per pound in August 2024, creating an unusual dynamic where processing cheese cost more than blocks. The price gap between block and barrel cheese stood at 4.75 cents in August 2024, a metric that processors watch closely when calculating margins for shredded low-fat blends. International auctions reflect similarly high valuations for key ingredients. Global Cheddar cheese prices at the Global Dairy Trade auction averaged US$ 4,973 per metric ton in November 2024, while Mozzarella prices averaged US$ 4,607 per metric ton. Additionally, Dry whey prices—often used in protein fortification—averaged 62.6 cents per pound in November 2025. These input costs force manufacturers in the low fat cheese market to balance premium pricing with competitive value propositions. Rising wholesale indices suggest that cost containment will remain a primary challenge for the remainder of the fiscal year. Premium Retail Pricing Reflects Strong Demand For Healthy Variants Retailers are successfully maintaining premium price points, validating the value-add nature of the low fat cheese market. Horizon Organic Lowfat Cottage Cheese, for example, retails for US$ 6.49 per 16-ounce tub, positioning it as a high-tier option. In the snacking aisle, Babybel Reduced Fat commands approximately US$ 4.99 at major US retailers, while Knudsen Lowfat Cottage Cheese holds a similar price point of US$ 4.99 for a 16-ounce container. These consistent price floors indicate that health-conscious consumers are willing to absorb higher costs for perceived nutritional benefits. Convenience formats further enhance margin potential for retailers in the low fat cheese market. Sargento Balanced Breaks retail for US$ 4.99 per 3-pack unit, capitalizing on the intersection of health and portability. Similarly, Frigo Cheese Heads in the string cheese segment retail for US$ 6.49 for a 10-ounce pack. Even in the meal category, Amy’s Kitchen Light in Sodium Macaroni & Cheese retails for US$ 3.79 per 9-ounce package, while Organic Valley 2% Milk—a key input proxy—retails for US$ 5.99 per gallon. These figures confirm that the market supports robust pricing structures across diverse product categories. Expanding International Trade Volumes are Reshaping Export Demand Channels in Low Fat Cheese Market Export markets are absorbing a significant portion of production, acting as a vital release valve for the market. US cheese exports totaled 42,459 metric tons in August 2024 alone. Impressively, cumulative US cheese exports for the first eight months of 2024 reached roughly 60,146 metric tons above the previous year's baseline. Mexico remains a primary partner, with exports increasing by 2,256 metric tons in August 2024. Within that flow, exports of "Other Cheese"—a category often housing processed and low-fat blends—rose by 1,942 metric tons, highlighting specific demand for versatile formulations. Global appetite extends beyond North America low fat cheese market, influencing long-term trade forecasts. US cheese exports to the MENA region increased by 1,245 metric tons in August 2024. Looking ahead, Japan is forecast to import an additional 6,886 metric tons of US cheddar-type cheeses between 2025 and 2026, adding to a total import volume that exceeded 251,913 metric tons. However, shifts are evident; Cheddar exports to Japan fell by 1,742 metric tons in August 2024, suggesting a pivot toward other varieties. With total US cheese exports for 2024 forecast to hit a record 508,808 metric tons, international trade remains a pillar of the market. Major Market Players Face Intense Competition From Private Label The competitive landscape of the low fat cheese market is defined by a battle between legacy brands and store-brand dominance. Sargento Foods remains a powerhouse, reporting peak annual revenue of US$ 1.3 billion in 2024, with shredded unit sales recorded at 116 million units. However, Kraft continues to lead in volume, with shredded unit sales reaching 266 million units. Despite these massive branded numbers, Private Label shredded cheese—often the entry point for budget-conscious low-fat shoppers—achieved a staggering 1.25 billion unit sales, dwarfing individual branded competitors. Smaller segments show equally fierce positioning battles. Tillamook recorded 42 million unit sales in the natural cheese category, carving out a premium niche. In the shelf-stable arena, Sargento holds the position of the No. 8 seller, while Mondelēz International saw cheese unit sales of 13 million. These metrics illustrate that while brand equity drives revenue, volume in the low fat cheese market is heavily swayed by private label accessibility. Brands must therefore innovate relentlessly to justify their price premiums against generic alternatives. Looking for Country-Level or Section-Wise Data? Customize This Report: https://www.astuteanalytica.com/report-walkthrough/low-fat-cheese-market Product Innovations and Dietary Inclusivity Define Future Growth Vectors Innovation in 2024 has focused heavily on "permissible indulgence" and dietary inclusivity. Arla Foods launched a new line of organic low-fat cottage cheese in February 2024, catering to the clean-label demographic. Similarly, Saputo Inc. introduced LightLife Mozzarella Shreds for foodservice, while Horizon Organic introduced a new organic low-fat cheese product in April 2024. These launches underscore the industry's pivot toward functional, high-quality offerings that elevate the perception of the low fat cheese market. Europe’s market value of US$ 38.9 billion in 2024 further validates the scale of this opportunity. Beyond traditional dairy, allergen-free attributes are expanding the addressable market. Babybel Plant-Based contains 0 grams of lactose, appealing to those with sensitivities, while Bel Brands expanded its dairy-free distribution to major retailers like Costco in 2024. Ricotta cheese held the largest product segment share in 2024, driven by its versatility in healthy cooking. Furthermore, gluten-free and lactose-free claims were key drivers in Arla's 2024 product expansions. These diverse innovation vectors ensure that the low fat cheese market remains dynamic and relevant to evolving consumer lifestyles.
