Title: Pokemon Card Shortages Are Pushing Up Prices Where You Least Expect It

It’s not just online resellers who have shockingly high Pokemon TCG prices these days. By Amanda Kay Oaks The Pokemon TCG hobby is in a difficult spot this year thanks to card shortages on not just popular sets like Scarlet & Violet – Prismatic Evolutions, but almost anything you might expect to see on your local store’s shelves. Indeed, fully stocked shelves of Pokemon cards have become a rare sight. Because cards are harder to come by, reseller prices for many sets and individual cards have skyrocketed as scalpers try to capitalize on the market. However, the difficulty of keeping Pokemon cards in stock is impacting prices outside of reseller markets like eBay, as well. Many retailers have been selling Pokemon TCG items for slightly above the Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail price, commonly known as MSRP. For instance, the upcoming Prismatic Evolutions restocks at GameStop are priced at roughly $10 more than MSRP. That’s a bit of a jump, but it’s nothing compared to what many resellers are trying to get for unopened items from the Prismatic Evolutions set. The Elite Trainer Box, for instance, has an MSRP of $49.99, is listed at GameStop for $59.99, and can be found on TCG Player with asking prices around $136.99. Clearly, buying from resellers is not going to be your best value. But one place many gamers do expect to see a fair price is at their local game store. Whereas many Pokemon TCG fans don’t have a particularly personal connection with big box stores that carry Pokemon cards, such as Target or Costco, many collectors do have a more friendly relationship with their local card shop. These independent sellers are often community gathering places as well as stores, hosting events for a variety of TCGs, including Pokemon, but also Magic: The Gathering and beyond. This means many TCG fans have come to expect fair pricing and even good deals from their local card shops. But the pressure in the market is being felt by smaller stores perhaps more than anywhere else, and it’s starting to show. Running a small business like a local card shop means working with narrow profit margins, especially when the overall economy is looking uncertain. That sometimes means making difficult choices, including marking up stock for hard-to-come-by items like Pokemon TCG cards. Lately, some Pokemon card collectors have noticed surprisingly high prices at their local stores, leading to even more frustration around the current state of the hobby. One fan reports that their local card store’s pre-order prices for the upcoming Destined Rivals set were marked up 50% over MSRP. This is a larger markup than most Pokemon TCG fans are used to seeing, especially at their local shops. While it could certainly be an attempt to increase profit on a popular item, these price increases are often a result of the increased cost local stores pay to get the items in stock. With shortages continuing, distributors often charge more for these hot-ticket items, which in turn means local stores need to either charge more or take a smaller profit themselves. And it’s not just new sets like Destined Rivals that are falling victim to price increases, either. One Reddit user reports seeing the Scarlet & Violet – 151 booster bundle at their store for nearly $200! For context, that same box is set at $26.94 at the Pokemon Center, though of course, it’s currently sold out. So, it’s quite an impressive markup, but one that may feel necessary given the current challenges of keeping Pokemon TCG cards in stock. At this price, it’s hardly going to fly off the shelves, but with the scarcity mindset, someone may well pay the price. Although it looks like a good number of local stores are marking up their Pokemon TCG items more than they used to, this increasing trend doesn’t mean every store is charging well above MSRP. Many fans report their local shops are still keeping prices in reasonable ranges despite the scarcity. So, it’s certainly still worth stopping by your local store when looking for Pokemon cards. Hopefully, as The Pokemon Company reprints some of the most popular sets, more fans, and the local stores they buy from, will be able to get Pokemon cards at reasonable prices again. Until then, we’ll keep relying on luck and good timing to find that pack opening feeling. Have you seen outrageously high prices on Pokemon cards recently? Let us know in the comments below!

Title: Consumers fearing price hikes from tariffs may be stocking up on pantry staples

Watch CBS News April 9, 2025 / 6:03 PM EDT / CBS News President Trump's reciprocal tariffs are currently on hold, but that's not stopping some consumers from stocking up canned foods and other nonperishables that they think could be affected by tariffs in the future. In the days immediately following Mr. Trump's sweeping reciprocal tariff announcement on April 2, purchases of goods in shelf-stable categories, including canned and jarred vegetables, instant coffee, ketchup and beer rose from the week earlier, according to data from Consumer Edge, a provider of consumer spending insights. Consumer Edge analyzed physical receipts and other transaction data at a variety of retailers, including big-box stores, warehouse clubs and convenience stores, to track purchases by item type. "We are seeing evidence of consumers picking up more items, potentially ahead of tariffs increasing pricing," Consumer Edge's head of insights, Michael Gunther, told CBS MoneyWatch. "We'll see if that continues." Though Mr. Trump on Wednesday issued a 90-day pause on country-specific reciprocal tariffs, a 125% levy on goods from China, also taking effect on Wednesday remains in place. That could mean more pain for shoppers, as tariffs are basically taxes on foreign goods paid for by businesses who then raise prices on products to make up for the added expense. With that in mind, some consumers appear to be shifting their shopping behavior and entering "stock up" mode, according to Consumer Edge. That means stocking up on goods that they would have otherwise purchased at a later time, in order to avoid potential price hikes. Here's how consumer buying patterns changed on April 3-4, compared with buying patterns on Thursday and Friday, one week earlier: Purchase volume also rose substantially compared with the average of all Thursdays and Fridays in 2025, according to Consumer Edge. The uptick in purchases across categories with relatively long lifespans makes sense, according to Gunther. "They will last for some time in someone's pantry, where it's OK to stock up," he said, noting that most coffee sold in the U.S. is imported from other countries. Additionally, on the Thursday and Friday following Mr. Trump's April 2 tariff announcement, shoppers on average took home more items per trip to major retailers Walmart and Target, Consumer Edge data shows. In the days leading up to April 2, shopping destinations including BJ's, Costco and Amazon, saw increases in transaction sizes, or money spent, additional data from Consumer Edge also shows. The larger basket sizes may reflect "preparation for future price increases," according to Gunther. "We saw an increase in the average ticket size among the big names where you might expect people to be going to stock up," he added. "If something shows up in different ways, it lends more credence to this being something real happening. It's important to see the initial reaction and it certainly seems like consumers are responding." It remains to be seen whether or not the pantry-stocking trend continues, as the threat of country-specific reciprocal levies continues to loom. Currently, in addition to the 125% levy on China, a 10% baseline tariff on all global imports remains in place. The Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan, nonprofit research group, estimated in an April 3 analysis that Mr. Trump's reciprocal tariffs, if applied at the rates he originally announced, could cost Americans $3.1 trillion over 10 years, amounting to $2,100 tax increase per household in 2025. Experts, however, caution consumers against resorting to panic-buying or hoarding goods they might not need. Such behavior can put pressure on demand, lead to shortages and stoke inflation, the warn.

Title: ‘No wonder why your mortgage isn’t paid.’ – Costco Customer Shows How Their Steaks Are Kind Of A Rip Off
URL: http://twistedsifter.com/2025/04/with-grocery-prices-so-high-you-really-need-to-shop-around-and-this-tiktoker-claims-costco-steaks-are-a-rip-off/

by Michael Levanduski Costco is a great company that offers some amazing deals if you shop smart. This TikToker, however, claims that some of their products are actually a rip off so you have to be careful. The video is him showing a four-pack of really nice-looking steaks with the caption, “Not everything is a good deal here. $69.41” It is crazy that four steaks, even strip lone steaks, cost that much nowadays. He starts talking and says, “$69 for four of these. No wonder why your mortgage isn’t paid.” He is right about that being expensive, but at least they will be delicious. He goes on to say, “I bought the same thing yesterday at Metro for $26.” Wow, I don’t have a Metro around me, but that sounds like a pretty insane deal. I’m wondering how Metro could sell them for such a low price. Maybe they aren’t the same cut or something. If they really are that much cheaper, I might have to start shopping around. Check out the full video and see what you think. You can see the video here: COSTCO OVERPRICED. #overpricedmeat ♬ original sound – P. The commenters are pretty skeptical. This commenter says that they don’t have good quality meat at Metro. Again, someone pointing out the quality difference. Apparently he posted a video of what he bought, and it was low-quality cuts. Some things are too good to be true. Now that you’ve read that story, check out this one about a delivery driver who took a $400 grocery order back because she wasn’t given a tip.
