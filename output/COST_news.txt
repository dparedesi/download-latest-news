More displayed on a smartphone screen, with the latest stock market chart of the company in the background, reflecting investor sentiment and recent trading activity, on May 25, 2025, in Chongqing, China. (Photo Illustration by Cheng Xin/Getty Images) Note: Costco FY’24 concluded on September 1, 2024. Costco’s (NASDAQ: COST) shares have experienced significant growth, increasing by 40% in 2024 (calendar year) and tacking on another 7% so far in 2025, easily surpassing the S&P 500’s 2% increase. What’s fueling this momentum? Robust performance supported by its membership model. In fiscal Q3 2025 (which ended on May 11), Costco generated $63.2 billion in revenue and $2.5 billion in operating profit. Of that amount, $1.2 billion was derived from membership fees alone—accounting for nearly half of the operating profit, and primarily recurring. With inflation putting pressure on household budgets, Costco’s value-oriented model is resonating well with consumers. In May 2025, sales experienced a year-over-year increase of 7%—more than twice the 3% growth across the broader U.S. retail industry. At first glance, it seems like a retail paradise. However, here’s the drawback: Costco is trading at 55 times earnings and 59 times free cash flow, resulting in a meager 1.7% cash flow yield. For perspective, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), which enjoys faster top-line growth and exposure to high-margin sectors like cloud and advertising, trades at a lower multiple. While Costco may claim scale, strategic position, and market affection, it comes at a hefty cost. Refer to Buy or Sell Costco Stock? Costco’s valuation assumes perfection, and even a minor deceleration could lead to turbulence. To put it in perspective, this stock is not immune to volatility. Shares plummeted nearly 49% during the 2008 financial crisis, 20% during the Covid-19 crisis in early 2020, and 32% during the inflation-driven pullback of 2022. Investors should remain aware of that history, even as the current fundamentals appear strong. Costco’s high valuation is based on its consistently strong performance. In fiscal Q3 2025, the company achieved earnings per share of $4.28, reflecting a 13% year-over-year increase, on $63.21 billion in revenue, an 8% rise. Comparable-store sales increased by 8% year-over-year, while e-commerce grew by nearly 15%, excluding fuel and currency impacts. Membership renewal rates remained exceptional, at 92.7% in the U.S. and Canada, and 90.2% globally, with total household memberships rising by 6.6%. In the latest quarter, Costco’s U.S. same-store sales surpassed Walmart’s (NYSE: WMT) 4.5% and significantly outperformed Target’s (NYSE: TGT) 3.8% decline, highlighting the warehouse model’s attractiveness to value-oriented shoppers. The company’s high-margin, recurring membership revenue has shown remarkable resilience during economic hardships, contributing to the stock’s recent surge. Operating 905 warehouses worldwide, including 624 in the U.S., Costco leverages its pricing advantage through extremely thin margins and the efficacy of its private-label brand, Kirkland Signature. In Q3, shopping frequency increased by 5.2%, while the average transaction size only rose by 0.4%, showing that foot traffic—not price inflation—is driving the growth. Costco’s adaptable supply chain has allowed it to manage increasing tariffs by redirecting shipments and altering sourcing strategies. With two-thirds of its merchandise sourced domestically and merely 8% of U.S. sales connected to China, its exposure to trade risks is limited. The company is also localizing Kirkland production and experiencing steady demand for essentials such as groceries and fuel. Its scale enhances pricing power, which is vital for maintaining its premium valuation. Costco continues to be a premier operator, but its high valuation seems detached from its fundamentals. Revenue growth is solid, yet not explosive, lingering in the low teens. Store expansion has slowed—less than 3% for this fiscal year—and some new locations may eat into existing sales, indicating a maturing presence. The current premium assumes that elevated growth will persist. If comparable sales trend towards mid-single digits, investor confidence—and Costco’s valuation multiple—could come under pressure. Investing in a single stock carries inherent risks. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which consists of 30 stocks, has a history of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last four-year period. Why is that? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have provided superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index, resulting in less volatile performance as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Bringing you yesterday's news from Japan and Asia, today. RocketNews24 Japanese It’s so classy, you’ll want to eat it with a knife and fork. There’s a supermarket in Japan nicknamed the “Japanese Costco” because much like its namesake, it sells very large quantities of food at bulk-discount prices. Its real name is Lopia, and our writer Ikuna Kamezawa often enjoys going there even though many of the things for sale are way too big for her to ever eat on her own. But this time, a certain cheeseburger bento caught her eye. It was large, but not too large, and only cost 1,078 yen (US$7.40), so she decided to take the meaty plunge. It was so big that she could barely fit it into her shopping bag and things only got worse as it started to rain while she walked home. She had to carry it very carefully too, for reasons we’ll see in a moment. After getting home, she unveiled her Manpuku Burger Double Cheese and confirmed its size at about 25 centimeters (10 inches) in length. Popping the lid off we can see that the very fancy arrangement was why Ikuna had to carry it so carefully, and the sheer volume of it all was the reason it was priced a little more than a Big Mac combo. She felt kind of bad disturbing the elegant layout of her bento, but she had to take stock of what was inside before eating it. There was a double cheeseburger with two patties and two slices of cheese, some seasoned fries, and two breaded chicken filets. That photo might not do the size justice so she took some shots alongside a pack of matches for scale. Sure, a matchbox might not be the most universally understood comparison, but she was just so excited to eat this thing. ▼ Fries ▼ Chicken Filets ▼ Double Cheese Burger Ikuna turned her attention back to the cheeseburger and tried to reassemble it in a normal way. That’s when she noticed something was off with the proportions of the bun and patties. She thought this must be some chic designer cheeseburger arrangement she’d never seen before. That might give the illusion Lopia is being chintzy with the meat, but rest assured they were good-sized beef patties. For a more understandable comparison, Ikuna placed a Yamazaki Bakery convenience store cheeseburger next to it. This store-bought burger selling for about 99 yen is slightly smaller than a McDonald’s cheeseburger and the Lopia burger blows it out of the water. ▼ Lopia’s burger ▼ Yamazaki’s burger There were definitely some structural integrity issues with it though, so our writer opted to eat the whole thing with a knife and fork. A fancy burger like this deserves fancy eating utensils anyway. The hamburger patty wasn’t juicy at all, but it was very dense and meaty. This texture might turn some burger aficionados off, but she felt kids would really go for it. There was also a sweet ketchup on it, but really the flavor of the beef stood out so much that she barely even remembers eating the cheese and bun. While it might not be for everyone, the taste of this burger bento was right up Ikuna’s alley. Her only complaint — if you could call it that — was that it was too much for her to eat in one sitting. But for the price she paid, that’s the kind of problem you’d want to have. In conclusion, she definitely recommends the Manpuku Burger Double Cheese for big eaters. Lopia can be a little random with their offerings, especially in the bento section, but Fridays are known as “Fry Days” there which is when they usually go all out in that department so your best chance is to find it then.

Title: The Best Growth Mutual Funds To Fuel Long-Term Capital Growth
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/best-growth-mutual-funds-long-term-growth/
Time Published: 2025-06-23T20:51:01Z

ByCatherine Brock ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. In investing, patience is rewarded. Mutual funds can deliver on several investment goals, with capital appreciation being near the top of the list. Growth mutual funds consolidate fast-moving companies into one portfolio, which can yield exciting results. The funds highlighted below cover a range of exposures and include both active and passive management styles. Despite the strategy differences, they align on the objective of delivering above-market returns for their shareholders. This list of growth mutual fund picks includes options targeting a range of exposures, from up-and-coming domestic small caps to foreign multinationals. They additionally meet these criteria: The table below highlights six top growth mutual funds that meet the noted parameters. Reviews of each fund follow. FECGX by the numbers: Fidelity's small cap growth fund tracks the Russell 2000 Growth Index. The index includes Russell 2000 companies that outperform peers on EPS growth and sales per share growth. The average five-year EPS growth for the group is 18.66%, about 50% higher than the 12.29% growth average among broader Russell 2000 companies. Historically, small caps have provided important diversification for stock portfolios. Smaller companies are riskier and more volatile, because they can have less predictable business performance and reduced access to capital. But smaller companies can grow faster than bigger ones, as they did between 2000 and 2012. While large caps have been dominant in recent years, many analysts believe this is a cyclical trend that will reverse itself. A conservative position in small caps prepares you for that reversal. FMDGX by the numbers: The Fidelity Mid Cap Growth Index Fund replicates the performance of the Russell Mid Cap Growth Index. The index isolates the growth-oriented companies of the Russell Mid Cap Index. These fast-movers are identified by high price-to-book ratios, two-year growth outlooks and historic sales per share growth. High-growth mid caps are poised to become the next large caps. Companies to watch in this portfolio include the AI darling Palantir Technologies (PLTR) and crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN). Middle-sized companies are more nimble than large caps and more stable than small caps. They can outpace large companies when the economy is expanding and they hold up better than small companies when the economy is contracting. Mid caps can also offer cheaper valuations than large caps—though Palantir is a notable exception. SWLGX by the numbers: Schwab’s large-cap growth fund invests in the Russell 1000 Growth Index. The index includes growth stocks that are also among the 1,000 largest U.S. companies by market capitalization. In five of the last six years, SWLGX has produced annual returns from 27.53% to 42.66%. 2022 was the exception; a broad technology sell-off in that year pushed SWLGX to a 29.16% decline. SWLGX has more than 50% concentration in the Magnificent Seven stocks: Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG) and Tesla (TSLA). The group earned the name by driving much of the S&P 500 gains in recent years. Given their collective performance, it’s hard not to prioritize them in a growth portfolio. Beyond the Magnificent Seven, SWLGX also includes payment processor Visa (V), pharma stock Eli Lilly (LLY), club store Costco (COST) and Home Depot (HD)—solid performers in their own right. ANWPX by the numbers: The New Perspective Fund invests in stocks that benefit from growing global trade. Portfolio companies are multinationals, each with a significant business presence outside their home country. About 53% of the fund's assets are U.S. equities, 43% is in foreign stocks and the remainder is held in cash. ANWPX is an actively managed fund, meaning the fund managers are making strategic trading decisions—rather than relying on an index to define the portfolio. Active funds can and sometimes do beat the market but they also charge a higher expense ratio than index funds. ANWPX has made the trade-off worthwhile in recent years, outperforming the MSCI All Country World Index and the Morningstar Global Large-Stock Growth category average in the prior 10-year and five-year periods. The portfolio includes many recognizable names in a composition you won't find in an index fund. Top holdings include Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) and French eyewear company EssilorLuxottica (ESLOF). VINEX by the numbers: The Vanguard International Explorer Fund invests in smaller growth companies located outside the U.S. The focus is on developed markets in Europe and the Pacific, though emerging markets stocks comprise 7.4% of the assets. The portfolio's median market capitalization is $4 billion, and its earnings growth rate is 14.6%. VINEX provides diversified exposure to foreign small caps—about 350 companies spread across 20 countries. The fund can be volatile, but the portfolio has strongly outperformed U.S. small caps in the last year, returning 12.52% compared to FECGX’s 3.5% return. Due to its volatility, you would hold this fund in a relatively small proportion alongside larger positions in domestic and foreign large caps. VWIGX by the numbers: VWIGX invests in non-U.S. large caps with growth characteristics. Portfolio companies are primarily located in Europe (48.6%), emerging markets (21.1%), the Pacific (17.2%) and North America (12.2%). The fund's median market cap is $90.4 billion and the earnings growth rate is 25.3%. Vanguard’s international large-cap growth fund holds interesting companies that may be too volatile for most investors to hold as individual positions. Examples include ecommerce giant MercadoLibre (MELI), Chinese tech company BYD (BYDDY) and Dutch semiconductor company ASML Holding NV. VWIGX earned a Silver rating from Morningstar in 2025, for excelling in process, performance, people, parent and price. The fund has a long-term focus, but its managers occasionally make opportunistic moves into stocks with trend-driven upside or those with underestimated potential. The fund can be volatile, so most investors will hold it as a diversifier rather than a core position. Bottom Line Growth investing is high risk and high reward. You can mitigate some risk through diversification and long holding periods. The diversification limits your dependence on one company, industry or economy. And long holding periods prevent you from realizing losses created by short-term volatility. In investing, patience is rewarded.

Title: A revolutionary drug for extreme hunger offers clues to obesity’s complexity

By Claire Sibonney, KFF Health News Ali Foley Shenk still remembers the panic when her 10-year-old son, Dean, finished a 20-ounce box of raisins in the seconds the cupboard was left unlocked. They rushed to the emergency room, fearing a dangerous bowel impaction. The irony stung: When Dean was born, he was so weak and floppy he survived only with feeding tubes because he couldn’t suck or swallow. He was diagnosed as a baby with Prader-Willi syndrome — a rare disorder sparked by a genetic abnormality. He continued to be disinterested in food for years. But doctors warned that as Dean grew, his hunger would eventually become so uncontrollable he could gain dangerous amounts of weight and even eat until his stomach ruptured. “It’s crazy,” said Foley Shenk, who lives in Richmond, Virginia. “All of a sudden, they flip.” Prader-Willi syndrome affects up to 20,000 people in the U.S. The most striking symptom is its most life-threatening: an insatiable hunger known as hyperphagia that prompts caregivers to padlock cupboards and fridges, chain garbage cans and install cameras. Until recently, the only treatment was growth hormone therapy to help patients stay leaner and grow taller, but it didn’t address appetite. In March, the Food and Drug Administration approved Vykat XR, an extended-release version of the existing drug diazoxide choline, which eases the relentless hunger and may offer insights into the biology of extreme appetite and binge eating. This breakthrough for these patients comes as other drugs are revolutionizing how doctors treat obesity, which affects more than 40% of American adults. GLP-1 agonist medications Ozempic, Wegovy and others also are delivering dramatic results for millions. But what’s becoming clear is that obesity isn’t one disease — it’s many, said Jack Yanovski, a senior obesity researcher at the National Institutes of Health, who co-authored some of the Vykat XR studies. Researchers are learning that obesity’s drivers can be environmental, familial or genetic. “It only makes sense that it’s complex to treat,” Yanovski said. Obesity medicine is likely heading the way of treatments for high blood pressure or diabetes, with three to five effective options for different types of patients. For example, up to 15% of patients in the GLP-1 trials didn’t respond to those drugs, and at least one study found the medications didn’t significantly help Prader-Willi patients. Yet, researchers say, efforts to understand how to treat obesity’s many causes and pathways are now in question as the Trump administration is dismantling the nation’s infrastructure for medical discovery. While Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. promotes a “Make America Healthy Again” agenda centered on diet and lifestyle, federal funding for health research is being slashed, including some grants that support the study of obesity. University labs face cuts, FDA staffers are being laid off en masse, and rare disease researchers fear the ripple effects across all medical advances. Even with biotech partnerships — such as the work that led to Vykat XR — progress depends on NIH-funded labs and university researchers. “That whole thing is likely to get disrupted now,” said Theresa Strong, research director for the Foundation for Prader-Willi Research. HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon said in a statement that no NIH awards for Prader-Willi syndrome research have been cut. “We remain committed to supporting critical research into rare diseases and genetic conditions,” he said. But Strong said that already some of the contacts at the FDA she’d spent nearly 15 years educating about the disorder have left the agency. She’s heard that some research groups are considering moving their labs to Europe. Early progress in hunger and obesity research is transforming the life of Dean Shenk. During the trial for Vykat XR, his anxiety about food eased so much that his parents began leaving cupboards unlocked. Jennifer Miller, a pediatric endocrinologist at the University of Florida who co-led the Vykat XR trials, treats around 600 Prader-Willi patients, including Dean. She said the impact she’s seen is life-changing. Since the drug trial started in 2018, some of her adult patients have begun living independently, getting into college, and starting jobs — milestones that once felt impossible. “It opens up their world in so many ways.” Over 26 years in practice, she’s also seen just how severely the disease hurts patients. One patient ate a four-pound bag of dehydrated potato flakes; another ingested all 10 frozen pizzas from a Costco pack; some ate pet food. Others have climbed out of windows, dived into dumpsters, even died after being hit by a car while running away from home in search of food. Low muscle tone, developmental delays, cognitive disabilities and behavioral challenges are also common features of the disorder. Dean attends a special education program, his mother said. He also has narcolepsy and cataplexy — a sudden loss of muscle control triggered by strong emotions. His once-regular meltdowns and skin-picking, which led to deep, infected lesions, were tied to anxiety over his obsessive, almost painful urge to eat. In the trial, though, his hyperphagia was under control, according to Miller and Dean’s mother. His lean muscle mass quadrupled, his body fat went down, and his bone mineral density increased. Even the skin-picking stopped, Foley Shenk said. Vykat XR is not a cure for the disease. Instead, it calms overactive neurons in the hypothalamus that release neuropeptide Y — one of the body’s strongest hunger signals. “In most people, if you stop secreting NPY, hunger goes away,” said Anish Bhatnagar, CEO of Soleno Therapeutics, which makes the medication, the company’s first drug. “In Prader-Willi, that off switch doesn’t exist. It’s literally your brain telling you, ‘You’re starving,’ as you eat.” GLP-1 drugs, by contrast, mimic a gut hormone that helps people feel full by slowing digestion and signaling satiety to the brain. Vykat XR’s possible side effects include high blood sugar, increased hair growth and fluid retention or swelling, but those are trade-offs that many patients are willing to make to get some relief from the most devastating symptom of the condition. Still, the drug’s average price of $466,200 a year is staggering even for rare-disease treatments. Soleno said in a statement it expects broad coverage from both private and public insurers and that the co-payments will be “minimal.” Until more insurers start reimbursing the cost, the company is providing the drug free of charge to trial participants. Soleno’s stock soared 40% after the FDA nod and has held fairly steady since, with the company valued at nearly $4 billion as of early June. While Vykat XR may be limited in whom it can help with appetite control, obesity researchers are hoping the research behind it may help them decode the complexity of hunger and identify other treatment options. “Understanding how more targeted therapies work in rare genetic obesity helps us better understand the brain pathways behind appetite,” said Jesse Richards, an internal medicine physician and the director of obesity medicine at the University of Oklahoma-Tulsa’s School of Community Medicine. That future may already be taking shape. For Prader-Willi, two other notable phase 3 clinical trials are underway, led by Acadia Pharmaceuticals and Aardvark Therapeutics, each targeting different pathways. Meanwhile, hundreds of trials for general obesity are currently recruiting despite the uncertainties in U.S. medical research funding. That brings more hope to patients like Dean. Nearly six years after starting treatment, the now-16-year-old is a calmer, happier kid, his mom said. He’s more social, has friends, and can focus better in school. With the impulse to overeat no longer dominating his every thought, he has space for other interests — “Star Wars,” “American Ninja Warrior” and a healthy appreciation for avocados among them. “Before the drug, it just felt like a dead end. My child was miserable,” Foley Shenk said. “Now, we have our son back.” ©2025 KFF Health News. Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

Title: Narwal Freo Z10 Robot Vacuum — Australian Review
URL: https://ausdroid.net/news/review/2025/06/22/narwal-freo-z10-robot-vacuum-australian-review/
Time Published: 2025-06-21T23:41:12Z

I’m lazy. I quite like doing as little as possible that resembles a “chore”, and yet, I enjoy living in a nice, clean, tidy space. You might think these two attributes are at odds with each other, and in a way, they are … however not entirely. Even a lazy person can have a moderately clean space with a little bit of help, and that’s precisely what Narwal’s Freo Z10 robot vacuum offers me. A little bit of help… and it goes a long way. In a nutshell, the Narwal Freo Z10 is a robot vacuum and mop system. Superficially, it presents the same aesthetic that robot vacuums have since their inception – little round discs that float around your house, vacuuming up dust, hair, crumbs and whatever else. However, there are some marked differences between the Freo Z10 and most other robot vacuums I’ve seen, and they really set it apart. For starters: This last point is one I’d like to dwell on. Anyone – and I do mean anyone – who’s had a robot vac or a Dyson stick vac or anything similar, anything with a roller, knows what an absolutely disgusting job it is to remove hair from the roller brush. Even if there are no people with long hair in your house, somehow, your vacuum will get gummed up with long hair within a few days and removing it is gross. Sometimes it comes away easily, other times you need a knife or scissors to pry it off. With Freo Z10’s DualFlow Tangle Free System, you can literally forget about this. Its three-step system will remove the long hair from your place every time, and you’ll never have to cut it out of your vacuum. Its clever sweeper arms can fold into different shapes when it detects a hair tangle, and it spins them down to the roller which effortlessly sucks the hair off and into the dustbin. I think the thing that I like the most is that, for the most part, I don’t have to think about or see the Freo Z10, whether it’s working or resting. When its resting, it’s quiet and out of the way.. yes it takes up a bit of space in my laundry, but I can close the door, and that’s done. I just have to make sure the door’s open before I leave for work in the morning, and Freo Z10 can get to work. When its working, it’s quiet, deftly avoids most obstacles (though it can get caught up on mobile phone charger cables) and works quickly. It can mop and vacuum my entire apartment in an hour or two, and it’s so quiet that I don’t usually hear it should I happen to be working from home… unless of course it decides to vacuum under my feet. Yes, I don’t let it go into the kids bedroom, because they’re pathologically incapable of picking up socks, cables, toys, and whatnot, and I don’t really want my house clean to be interrupted by the Freo Z10 getting trapped in there before it’s finished everything else. It’s great in the kitchen, too – it vacuums first, then comes back to mop after on its usual program (which you can customise as you see fit), but it’s good for cleaning up ad-hoc messes too. The other day I spilled a coffee in the kitchen, and while I picked up the big bits of the broken cup, there were little shards of ceramic everywhere, as well as most of the contents. Freo Z10 went to work, and while it vacuumed first – and cleaned up all the shards – it did mean it drove through the coffee and I was a little concerned it might wheel coffee tracks over the carpet to get back to its base station. I’m not exactly sure how, but it this didn’t eventuate – the mop pads definitely were a bit brown, but it lifted them out of the way to drive over the carpet, cleaned itself, came back and finished the job. With no intervention whatsoever – besides picking up the larger ceramic pieces that you’d never vacuum anyway – my kitchen was returned to a sparkling clean state within ten minutes. So, too, were Freo Z10’s mop pads – the base station has a deep wash cycle after each mopping exercise, which rinses, washes, and then dries the mop pads. The downside is that it gets through a bit of water to do this, and the grey water tank needs emptying after three or four cycles, but the plus side is a functional mop every time, no stinky wet-mop smell, and a clean house. Can’t complain. Not a great deal. The elephant in the room is the price – Narwal’s Freo Z10 retails for $1,599 at the time of writing, down from its launch price of $1,999. It remains quite expensive, though, and there are definitely more affordable options on the market. However, it is a case of getting what you pay for, and with the Freo Z10, you get all the bells and whistles. It’s a top class vacuum. When I say you get all the bells and whistles, though, there are a couple missing. Yes, Freo Z10 integrates with your choice of voice assistant from Google, Amazon or Apple .. but the integration isn’t amazing. I had a few goes with Alexa and found that it generally didn’t work all that well – after pairing, it seemed reluctant to actually work, though this might’ve been more Alexa’s shortcoming than anything else. It pairs to Google Home, too, but it seems that when its paired with Alexa, you can’t pair it with anything else, which is a bit limiting if you happen to use both. It doesn’t integrate with Home Assistant, and Narwal’s developers have (according to discussion on Reddit) declined to make that possible in future, which smart home aficionados might be a little upset about. As much as I’d love this feature, it’s easy enough to run Freo Z10 on a schedule, and the phone app makes it easy to schedule ad-hoc tasks. The obstacle detection is really good – probably among the best in class – but even still, Freo Z10 manages to get caught up. Twice I’ve found it with a mouthful of my USB-C phone charger, once it ate my daughter’s swimming bag, and it chowed down on a hairbrush (??) one day. However, these were minor things and easily adjusted to avoid future problems, and in the last week, there’s been no jams or anything. Yes.. you do have to clean up a bit for your cleaner, the cliche holds true. Yes. Probably the only reasons you’d think otherwise is the cost, if you don’t have room for what isn’t the smallest base station around, or if you’ve already got a decent robot vacuum. Otherwise, for the lazy homekeeper, the Narwal Freo Z10 is a welcome addition and will reduce your household chores significantly. Yes, it can’t clean your toilets or scrub your shower down, but it can vacuum, mop and sweep, freeing you up for those less pleasant jobs. Narwal’s Freo Z10 retails for $1,599 and you can buy it online from Narwal Australia, Amazon (with delivery in a couple of days), or you can find it in-store at Costco nationwide, Good Guys, and JB HiFi (though not all retailers have actual stock, it might be more a delivery thing). However you get one, we recommend that you do, and you won’t be sorry.
