As part of its Memorial Day sale, Amazon has brought back the $100 price drops across the latest iPad mini 7 lineup. These are matching the lowest we have tracked there since release last fall, but Costco members can score select models for less. They are going out of stock quick, so you’ll want to get in there as fast as possible if you’re interested – the best deal still live is the mid-range 256GB model at $45 less than Amazon. Details below. Costco is now offering its members the 256GB model iPad mini (A17 Pro) down at $449.97 with $5 shipping. Regularly $599, this is $145 off if you include the shipping fee and $45 under the best price we have tracked at Amazon to date. Only the blue and Space Gray colors are in-stock at this price at the time of writing, and they are likely to go quick. Now the cost of a Costco membership will offset the savings here, but if you are already a member, this is the lowest price we can find online and the best we have tracked yet.

Title: Crazy-Good Ticket Deal for Disneyland’s 70th!
URL: https://www.disneytouristblog.com/costco-ticket-deal-disneyland-70th-anniversary-halloween-christmas-2025/
Time Published: 2025-05-20T23:39:15Z

Disney has released a new deal for Disneyland & California Adventure admission that beats the current general public 70th Anniversary discount, and offers a ‘fully loaded’ Park Hopper ticket with Lightning Lane Multi-Pass & more for a crazy-good price. Here are dates & details about the special offer, plus comparisons to other past & present ticket promos, an assessment of the value proposition, and more. For a limited time, guests can save ~$180 per person (!!!) on the purchase of a 3-Day Disneyland Park Hopper Ticket with Lightning Lane Multi Pass for only $150 per day. This special offer is valid for admission from May 20, 2025 through December 19, 2025, meaning it’s not just good for the summer of Disneyland’s 70th Anniversary, but also Halloween and Christmas! This ticket is $449.99 for all ages, and is a fully-loaded three-day Disneyland ticket with the Park Hopper option and LLMP. A standard multi-day Disneyland ticket with the same add-ons would cost $601 directly from Disney. Even the current 3-Day Disneyland Anniversary Ticket Deal costs $546 with the Park Hopper and Lightning Lane Multi Pass, making this fully-loaded deal ~$100 off that discounted price in an apples to apples comparison. As an added bonus, this new 70th deal includes a $30 Disney Dining Gift Card that can be used throughout Disneyland Resort! Of course, that assumes you want the Park Hopper and Lightning Lane Multi-Pass add-ons, and that you will eat a meal of food in the parks. It also assumes you want to visit Disneyland and DCA for three days, as opposed to longer. The 4-day version of the general public anniversary deal–which is the one Disneyland has been “pushing” guests towards by virtue of its superior per day pricing–costs $400 total or only $100 per day, making that the better deal if you’re looking for bottom-dollar pricing. However, that is very obviously not an apples to apples comparison. Once you include the Park Hopper and Lightning Lane Multi-Pass add-ons, the 4-Day Disneyland Anniversary Ticket Deal costs $623, or $155.75 per day. This ticket deal still comes in below that, at $150 per day (and again, includes that bonus $30 dining card). Of course, there’s a catch (isn’t there always?). This $449 fully-loaded Disneyland ticket deal is only available at Costco, while supplies last. Moreover, it’s only being sold in-store in select West Coast markets throughout California, as well as stores in Oregon and Washington. At present, it’s not available at stores in Arizona, Nevada, Utah, or beyond. (It comes up on an inventory check as either “sold out” or “no match found.”) We paid a visit to our local Costco in Orange County, where there’s a huge display and a total stock of 200 of these discounted Disneyland tickets. There was also a Costco employee lingering around the display, offering her “pitch” for the special offer. I kinda felt like Ron Swanson as she broke things down for me, but I politely bit my tongue and quietly listened to the spiel, which was mostly accurate-ish! Here’s the fine print on the Costco Disneyland 70th Anniversary Ticket Deal: Tickets valid for use beginning May 20, 2025 and expire December 19, 2025. Tickets may be used on nonconsecutive days. A ticket must be used by the same person on all days. Each ticket is valid for three (3) days of admission to both Disneyland Park and Disney California Adventure Park, including visits to both Parks on the same day. Each day of use constitutes one full day of use. Tickets are nonrefundable, may not be sold or transferred for commercial use and exclude activities/events separately priced. Offer may not be combined with other ticket discounts or promotions. Subject to restrictions and change or cancellation without notice. To enter a park, both a theme park reservation and a valid ticket for the same park on the same date are required. Check park availability by visiting disneytraveltradeinfo.com/dlrcalendar prior to purchase. Theme park reservations are limited, subject to availability, and are not guaranteed. Guests with a Park Hopper ticket must make a park reservation for the first theme park they wish to visit to begin their day; then they can cross over and switch between parks on the same day after 11:00 AM (subject to availability). The ability to visit the other park will be subject to that park’s capacity limitations, operational hours, closures and other restrictions, and is not guaranteed. One (1) $30 Disney Dining Card for each 3-Day Park Hopper Ticket purchased. Value of Disney Dining Card may not be applied toward the ticket price. Disney Dining Card is nonrefundable and redeemable only for food and beverages at participating locations within the Disneyland Resort, Walt Disney World Resort and other Disney Resorts located in the U.S. Certain parks, attractions, services, experiences and offerings may be modified, limited in availability or unavailable, and are subject to restrictions, and change or cancellation without notice. Park admission and offerings are not guaranteed. Select shows, performances, and experiences, including parades and nighttime spectaculars, will temporarily pause to make way for seasonal entertainment offerings, then resume at later dates. Check entertainment schedules before visiting. If the new Costco Disneyland Anniversary Ticket Offer isn’t for you due to travel dates or because you need longer duration tickets, see our 2025 Discount Disneyland Ticket Buying Guide for additional recommendations. There are a few notable details about this Costco ticket deal to which we want to draw your attention. First, this special offer does not have a “fuse,” which means you can use the first admission this summer for the 70th kickoff, once again between August and October for Halloween Time (see our Guide to Halloween Time at Disneyland), and then one final visit during Holiday Time at Disneyland (see our Guide to Christmas at Disneyland). Those are just examples–you could do all three days next week, during our favorite week of the year, or from December 17-19, 2025. Second, this Costco ticket deal has a longer eligibility window than we’ve seen for any ticket deal in recent memory. And by “recent memory,” I mean since 2016 when we started tracking these discounts. (It was back then that Costco offered a special DCA-only Annual Pass. Unsurprisingly, it was cheaper than this–but almost everything was a decade ago!) It’s unprecedented for a ticket deal like this to cover summer, Halloween and Christmas. It’s also unprecedented for a discount to encompass several popular holidays without blockouts. Fall Break/Columbus Day, Halloween, Veterans Day, and Thanksgiving are all fair game. You can use this through the third week in December, right before peak Christmas week crowds descend upon Disneyland. For reference, the current Disneyland Anniversary Ticket offer runs now through August 14, 2025. Given the early end of that offer (coupled with this Costco deal), we wouldn’t be surprised to see a special offer for late August through December 2025–but we also wouldn’t be surprised if it’s targeted at Californians, more expensive than this, or doesn’t cover all of these dates. Finally, it’s unclear whether this Costco deal is pulling park reservations from the same “bucket” as the new Disneyland Anniversary Ticket Offer or from regular full-price park tickets. Our assumption is the 70th promo. This is exactly how Magic Keys already work, as well as other recent ticket promos. So it’s really nothing new. Nevertheless, it’s important to understand because these ticket deals are popular–they always are, and that’s even when they’re just for California residents. This is more akin to last summer’s general public ticket deal, but being rolled out at the start of Disneyland’s 70th Anniversary. It thus stands to reason that this deal will be bought by a higher percentage of guests, meaning more people in this “pool” competing for the same reservations. As Disney warns, some dates are going to be difficult to book–even when availability is wide open for other ticket types. The good news is that Disneyland does reallocate reservation availability as demand dictates; the bad news is that they aren’t very good at it, and it can be very hit or miss (requiring a strong refresh game). Anyway, just bringing this to your attention because we know some people gloss over the terms and conditions, viewing that as CYA legal language that has no real bearing on the deal. Here, that’s only partially true. The way this new Disneyland Anniversary Ticket Offer works with park reservations is a typical legal disclaimer to avoid (another) lawsuit, but it’s also crucial for you to understand so you don’t end up with tickets you can’t use. The biggest impediments to this Disneyland 70th Anniversary Ticket Deal at Costco will presumably be a membership to the big-box warehouse store. If you’re more of a Sam’s Club house, this does you no good. Even if you are a Costco member, you might have issues purchasing this if you live outside of California, Washington or Oregon since it’s in-store only. When we asked an employee, they did indicate that inventory was limited and their store had received an initial stock of 200 tickets. They were unsure if the deal would be restocked, or if this was it–and it was over once it sold out. Waiting until you arrive in California for your vacation to buy these discounted tickets at Costco is a gamble. Not only because they might already be sold out, but because park reservations are required and those might be gone. If you’re a Costco member living on the West Coast and this special offer is available at your local store, this deal is pretty much a no-brainer. But if not, you might want to consider the current general public deal instead. As a reminder, the general public Disneyland 70th Anniversary Ticket Deal is available now through August 14, 2025. You can purchase tickets directly from Disney or buy this deal via Get Away Today with even greater savings. Here’s a pricing breakdown and other important details… 3-Day, 1-Park Per Day Ticket for $120 Per Day 4-Day, 1-Park Per Day Ticket for $100 Per Day In a normal year, there are two main types of ticket deals. There’s the summer one, which has morphed from a Golden State deal for all Californians to a general public discount in the last two years. Historically, the summer deal with the wider eligibility pool costs more. Before that, there’s the winter and spring special offer–which ran this year until May 15, 2025–that’s only available to Southern California residents. Disneyland has done this consistently for at least the last decade. It’s the much more established and longstanding deal–the summer discount is more recent addition during the post-reopening era. This year’s version of that SoCal resident deal is the best we’ve seen in a while, and is actually better than last year–and significantly so. It offers discount admission for as low as $67 per day on select days with the purchase of a 3-day, 1-park per day ticket. That deal beats this Costco in terms of bottom line price (which we assume matters to at least some degree if you’re in the market for discounted tickets), but not on an apples to apples basis once accounting for Park Hopping and Lightning Lane Multi-Pass. Since this Costco Disneyland 70th Anniversary Ticket Deal is unlike anything that came before it, I’m just going to share special offer ticket prices from the last several years and let them speak for themselves… 2025 SoCal Resident Winter & Spring Ticket Deal Prices: 2024 All Guest Summer & Fall Ticket Deal Prices: 2024 SoCal Resident Winter & Spring Ticket Deal Prices: 2023 California Resident Summer & Fall Ticket Deal Prices: 2023 SoCal Resident Winter & Spring Ticket Deal Prices: 2022 California Resident Summer & Fall Ticket Deal Prices: 2022 SoCal Resident Winter & Spring Ticket Deal Prices: 2021 California Resident Disneyland Ticket Deal Prices: 2020 SoCal Resident Disneyland Ticket Deal Prices: 2019 SoCal Resident Disneyland Ticket Deal Prices: 2018 SoCal Resident Disneyland Ticket Deal Prices: 2017 SoCal Resident Disneyland Ticket Deal Prices: 2016 SoCal Resident Disneyland Ticket Deal Prices: Ultimately, this Costco Disneyland 70th Anniversary Ticket Deal is a crazy-good deal if you’re at least semi-local and wanting to make a few visits to Disneyland and Disney California Adventure for the 70th Anniversary, Halloween, and Christmas. (For recommendations on when to do DLR, see our list of the Best & Worst Weeks to Visit Disneyland in 2025 & 2026.) That’s especially true if you want or need all of the bells and whistles on your admission, as this degree of discount is unprecedented in the last decade or so. What amounts to around $180 off per ticket is a tremendous savings, even if it does require buying the fully-loaded option with all of the add-ons. If you want longer duration tickets, live outside the West Coast, aren’t a Costco member, or are more concerned with getting the bottom-dollar price, there are better alternatives for you. Regardless, it’s great to see a discount that’s this aggressive, and better that what Disney is offering directly. This is surprising to see right as the 70th starts, and suggests that more deals are in the pipeline! Planning a Southern California vacation?

Hearing your feedback–even when you disagree with us–is both interesting to us and helpful to other readers, so please share your thoughts below in the comments! Thanks for the tip, I was about to spend $1858 for 4 x 2 day tix with park hopper and LL so not only do I save some money, but get an extra day for future use and $120 in dining gift cards. The first Costco I went to was already sold out (this was yesterday and evening) but that store was able to locate other stores nearby that still had some. They only got 100 of them. This is two years in a row where I’ve scrambled to buy tickets from reputable third party companies when price hikes are announced only to see much, much better deals come later on (last year was WDW but this time it’s DLR.) Regrets. Is there any strategy on *when* to buy tickets? After this happening two years in a row, I think I’m going to avoid the price hike rush and just put off purchasing as long as I can…I think. Does anyone know about who is allowed to use the purchased tickets? My wife and I who live in Pennyslyvania are planning to visit our California friend. If she picks up the Costco deal for herself and us, would we be able to use it if we are not the original purchaser or Costco members? There’s no residency restriction! What you’re describing would work perfectly fine! I am so disappointed that these are only offered in person. We have a trip planned for June with 6 of us for 3 days and this deal would save us over $700. I can’t take the gamble that they (and park reservations ) would be available when we land and I don’t know that I could trust sending someone over $2500 to get us some. Unfortunately we’ll just have to go through Disney and spend the extra $700 that could have helped elsewhere. Roberta, your Costco app has an option to search the inventory in your local warehouse. I would try that on all the Costco‘s within a 50 mile radius of you. It shouldn’t take longer than 10 minutes, and some posters below are saying they have seen the tickets in non-West Coast Costco‘s. I found these at Costco in Boise so at least some Idaho stores are also included. I think it’s really important to highlight the non-consecutive restriction more. I asked a friend in CA to buy for me and luckily I caught it before he bought because I’d have to add an extra night onto my trip to make it work and other people with short trips might not realize. From the way I read it, nonconsecutive is an option, rather than a restriction. That is, it says you “may” use it on nonconsecutive days (and spread them out however works for you). It doesn’t say “must” be used on nonconsecutive days, meaning you have no other option. Ah I think you’re right Lori. Thanks for catching that for me!! This is such a great deal! Hoping they are still available when I can get up to Oregon to buy one. Question: Can these be upgraded to a 4 day, 5 day, etc.? I’ve upgraded before when buying tickets from Get Away Today or others, and it’s never been a problem. I’d love to take advantage of the 4 day Anniversary deal, but we’re not going until the first week of December! (Thanks for the rec on that one Tom, looking forward to the cooler weather and low crowds!) This is an ABSURDLY good deal. Hope Costco doesn’t run out before we can get over there!! No weekend blackouts? Includes LLMP? Comes with a random $30 gift card? Valid from MAY TO DECEMBER?! The only possible downside is reservation availability, but as long as you book in advance ur chilling. It really is! Our parents don’t necessarily “need” Park Hoppers or LLMP when they come out to visit, but we’re still debating getting this over the current ticket deal for them. The big thing for us is the December expiration–visiting once this summer, once in October, and once in early December would be fantastic. I just purchased tickets for DL for this June and was shocked at this price savings, $300 less than what I just paid, but then didn’t feel quite as bad when I read the details. What a fantastic deal if you happen to live in CA! Wow. This is an amazing deal. I wish they’d make it available across the country because this is about $10 less than I paid for a 2-day Park Hopper with Lightning Lane Multi Pass ticket through Get Away Today for a trip in March and that obviously didn’t include the dining credit. One element that made last summer’s deal so much better was that it also included kid’s prices equivalent to the 50% off tickets offered in the Winter off-season. That made it easily the best publicly available deal in recent memory. This deal is definitely aggressive and I appreciate it. I don’t think we’re going to get a trip in this year, but if deals keep being this good it’s at least a little more likely. Thanks Tom!!!

Title: Bargain butter brings in the crowds

Plus You are not permitted to download, save or email this image. Visit image gallery to purchase the image. Photo: Supplied/John Paul R. Bicerra By Susan Edmunds and Louise Ternouth of RNZ It was organised chaos this week at Costco when another delivery of butter arrived. This butter is not just any butter - while the other supermarkets are selling a 500g slab for up to $10, Costco's butter is $9.99 for a kilogram. Jody Middleton was among the crowd waiting to stock up on Monday. "I have to say most people were pretty polite about it," she said. "We all knew what we were there for, Costco staff came out and had a chat before they even opened the door, answering questions." She said it was worthwhile braving the crowds. She buys 12 boxes of butter to last her bakery a week. If she bought her butter elsewhere it would have cost more than $800 more. "Compared to Woolworths, it's a saving of $838 for my business in a week." Butter prices have increased significantly over the past year. Stats NZ data showed last week that butter prices were up 65.3 percent in the 12 months to April. Costco butter gets snapped up almost as soon as it arrives on the shelves, and one Taranaki man is making the 750km return trip to get it. Kaleb Halverson decided to start making the trip from New Plymouth to Auckland to deliver Costco's 1kg blocks of butter at $9.99 to customers across the Taranaki region. He only had a few orders at first, but they kept rolling in. 'Butter Boy' Kaleb Halverson loads up on the 1kg blocks on his round trips to Costco in Auckland. Photo: Supplied Halverson makes the trip every few weeks, with the next trip set for May 29, and he told Checkpoint the idea started out as an idea from his mum. "After she made a trip up [to Costco] herself and came back and just thought why not get groceries from there and bring them back for everyone else." He brings back everything the store has to offer, but said butter is definitely top of the list. "It's our hot item at the moment every order has butter." Other popular products are cleaning products and snacks. At the moment he is just servicing the Taranaki region with orders made through his website. Halverson does the orders on top of his full-time job, so the 10-hour round trip is done all on a day off. "We wake up at 4am, pack the car with a bunch of chilly bins, drive up four and a-half hours. "We go and we buy what people have ordered, spend quite a few hours in Costco looking for everything, pack the car and just head back." While he has only done a few trips so far, on the last one he brought back 160 blocks of butter, storing it in chilly bins and chilly bags. Now renting a van, Kaleb said they can do 300 blocks with a limit of 15 blocks per customer and a fee of $2 a block which makes it $12 a kg. He said they were losing out on money on their last trip, so they had upped the service fee from $10 to $40 to cover the cost of petrol and van hire. Halverson told Checkpoint it was still economical for customers to beat the rising cost of supermarket groceries. "It seems to be worth it for people because we've got quite a few orders. "It's unaffordable at the moment just everything here." Kaleb said he would likely have to leave even earlier for his next trip to Costco, as customers were queueing to get their hands on the $9.99 1kg block before the store even opened. Rob Hamlin, a senior lecturer at Otago University, said it was not a price that any retailer supplied by Fonterra could match. Photo: Supplied/John Paul R. Bicerra "The price charged by Costco for packed and processed New Zealand butter at retail is only marginally more than the current price being achieved by Fonterra at auction for its unprocessed milk solids as a bulk unprocessed export commodity." The butter is supplied by Westland Milk Products, which is owned by Yili Group. He said butter was either a "whopping" loss leader for Costco or Yili was trying to undercut the market. Costco declined a request for comment and Westland did not respond. Retail consultant Chris Wilkinson of First Retail Group said Costco knew it had to have a pricing advantage to maintain its value proposition for shoppers. "So achieve that through a pack size that no other retailer offers, and by making a little margin off a lot of volume. "Also, as a global retailer they will be one of the world's largest purchasers of dairy product which will afford them better deals than any Australasian retailer could hope for. They are trading on the world market." He said the pack size was probably not ideal for many households. "And the fact that you still have to spend your $70 to get your membership each year… all these things need to be considered." Chris Schulz, a senior investigative journalist at Consumer NZ, said it looked likely that the Costco butter was a loss leader. "The retailer's Facebook page is flooded with people speculating when the butter might be back on shelves, debating when to visit, and showing off when they do get it. "With butter costing at least $17 per kilo elsewhere else, Costco's pricing makes them look like the 'good guys' in contrast to our supermarket duopoly. Once they're in store, I'm sure many people are picking up roast chickens, cheese, and giant tubs of biscuits too." Fonterra said it could not comment on the pricing models of other retailers and consistent rises in global dairy commodity prices, could lead to an increase in the wholesale price of products like butter and cheese. "We are committed to keeping prices as low as possible, but they may sometimes need to be adjusted to reflect the increased costs." SUBSCRIBER SUBSCRIBER SUBSCRIBER SUBSCRIBER SUBSCRIBER

Title: The 6 Groceries Smart Meal Planners Always Buy in Bulk

Our expert, award-winning staff selects the products we cover and rigorously researches and tests our top picks. If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Reviews ethics statement We asked experts about the best foods to stock up on to save money and trips to the supermarket. We spoke with a meal planning expert to find out which foods are smartest to buy in bulk. Grocery prices continue to be a major concern for many Americans. A recent survey by CNET confirms that rising food costs remain the top source of sticker shock—and I can relate. Over time, we've explored various strategies to stretch your grocery budget, from using food-saving apps like Flashfood, to comparing name brands versus store brands, and even asking whether shopping at Trader Joe's really saves money. Another tried-and-true strategy? Buying in bulk. Stocking up on everyday staples at warehouse stores like Costco can lead to significant savings. In fact, after crunching the numbers, I found that the average person could potentially save around $1,000 a year by buying in bulk. But bulk shopping isn't always simple. You'll need to think about storage space, shelf life and whether you'll actually use what you buy. As Mary Ann Kelley, the meal planning expert behind AddSaltandServe, puts it: "Shoppers can ask themselves three questions: A great deal isn't a deal if you end up throwing half of it away. Read more: Here's What an Expert Told Me About Food Expiration Dates Accepting that bulk shopping is generally a financially savvy move, and given the considerations posed above, I asked a few shopping and meal prepping experts what the best foods are to buy in bulk. Here they are: Beans are packed with protein and they're the perfect candidates to buy in bulk. "Canned beans are a pantry staple and a smart bulk purchase, thanks to their long shelf life and affordability at warehouse stores," says Kristen Markel, the bulk shopping expert behind Warehouse Wanderer. Beans also are incredibly versatile for food prep, as they can fit into just about any meal, including dessert. (Black bean brownies are worth your time.) Plus they have real staying power. "Properly stored in a cool, dark place, canned beans can last up to five years," says Markel. An eight-pack of canned beans at Costco retails for about $8, bringing the cost per can to under a dollar, and the cost per serving to about 30 cents. If you've got the time and wherewithal for dried beans, the savings are even bigger. A 10-pound bag of black beans costs around $18, for a cost per serving of less than 25 cents. If freezer space allows, fish is far more affordable when you buy in bulk. Meat and seafood in the freezer section are often frozen right after harvesting, so they can still be very high in quality. You can also process proteins bought fresh and freeze them yourself, and either way certain types of meat and seafood can stay in your freezer for up to a year. (This FoodKeeper app from the US Department of Health and Human Services is a handy guide to how long you can store various foods.) "Shoppers can often find bulk-packaged fresh and frozen meat at a better price, or they may stock up on bulk amounts of normal packages of meat when they are on sale," says Kelley. It's possible to have a bulk shopping mindset even if you don't have access to a traditional bulk store. "Meat bought in bulk at a good price can be frozen as is, but shoppers can also save space -- and make dinner prep less stressful -- by cooking meats ahead that will be used later in cooked form in recipes. For instance, shoppers can cook bulk packages of ground beef or chicken when they bring them home, and then they can use the cooked meat for recipes like tacos, chili, and chicken soup." Butter is more shelf-stable than most people think, making it a good candidate for buying in bulk. We typically think primarily of the pantry or freezer when it comes to buying in bulk, but "don't overlook dairy, especially butter," says Markel. "Butter freezes beautifully and can last up to a year in the freezer." Costco's Kirkland Signature butter is considered one of its most economical offerings among fans, around $18 (in my region) for 4 pounds, which doesn't come with an overwhelming space requirement in the freezer. At my nearest grocery store, the same amount of butter costs twice that much. Boxed pasta lasts for up to two years. Boxed pasta may require some storage space, but if you're able to bulk up on it, it has the longevity to make it worthwhile. "Dry pasta is another bulk-buy winner, with an unopened shelf life of up to two years," says Markel. "For even longer storage, consider vacuum-sealing pasta to maintain freshness well beyond its typical expiration." (Here are the best vacuum sealers we've tested.) Eight pounds of Barilla penne cost $13 at Costco, which results in a savings of over a dollar per pound compared with buying individual boxes at my local supermarket. Italian American families, or carb lovers, take note. Not all spices are good to buy in bulk, but whole peppercorns keep their pep for a while. Items with the highest prices per ounce can be prime candidates for bulk shopping, on a case-by-case basis depending on longevity. "Specialty items that cost significantly less on sale can be worth buying in bulk, but only if they will be used," says Kelley. "A good example of this is expensive spices that might be used frequently, like quality black peppercorns," she says. Other specialty items that can be pricey but can be stockpiled when they're on sale include saffron, tinned fish and even caviar -- which can actually be frozen when unopened and kept for up to a year. If you want to get the most bang for your buck, buy paper towels and other household products in bulk. So long as you're bulk shopping, here's a bonus nonfood item. "Paper products are among the items that are less expensive to buy in bulk packaging, especially toilet paper and paper towels," says Kelley." "Since paper products do not need to be stored in a climate controlled area, utility spaces, attics and other unfinished spaces are fine for storage, making it easier to make room for them." If you have a paper towel dependency, as I do, consider a 12-pack of Kirkland paper towels for $23, versus single rolls that can be as much as $3 and up.

ByRobert Daugherty ByRobert Daugherty, Contributor. Moody's lowered the sovereign credit rating of the US, joining S&P and Fitch in stripping America's AAA status. While this is historic and will attract media attention, it reveals what has long been the Federal government's poor governance and management. Spending more than it collects in taxes and lacking the courage to make difficult decisions and think long term. The current administration is admirably trying to right the financial ship. However, its on-again, off-again tariffs will never collect the intended revenue. Additionally, its proposed tax reductions come without corresponding serious spending cuts or addressing entitlement payments. While the Federal government operates under different constraints than states, a comparative fiscal analysis proves instructive. Washington State's prudent financial governance stands in stark contrast to Washington DC's struggle with fiscal discipline. The state maintains exemplary creditworthiness through constitutional balanced budget requirements and strategic reserve mechanisms that have earned it high ratings from credit agencies—precisely the credentials the federal government has now lost. Washington State's economic fundamentals further distinguish it: the state ranks among national leaders in both median household income and GDP per capita. As federal fiscal challenges mount under the weight of escalating debt, Washington State's diversified economy continues to thrive, powered by a formidable technology sector, robust job creation, and sustained investment in innovation that positions the region for continued long-term growth despite broader economic headwinds. Looking specifically at Washington state, one can imagine an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) that would likely best the S&P 500 with names like Costco (COST), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Redfin (RDFN) and Weyerhaeuser (WY). For investors seeking above-average long-term equity returns, these value stocks are primed to deliver. There are three Seattle-based companies that are worth buying now: Nordstrom (ticker JWN), Starbucks (SBUX) and Alaska Air Group (ALK), all of which offer attractive long-term returns. Nordstrom represents one of Seattle's most iconic retail success stories. Founded in 1901, this luxury department store chain has built a reputation for exceptional customer service and premium merchandise. After facing headwinds in recent years from e-commerce competition and pandemic disruptions, Nordstrom is executing a compelling turnaround strategy focused on omnichannel integration and its off-price Nordstrom Rack division. The company's most recent quarterly earnings exceeded Wall Street expectations, with stronger-than-anticipated same-store sales growth and improved margins. Nordstrom reports earnings on June 6th, so stay tuned to hear more about their turnaround plans. Despite the challenging retail environment created by the current administration's ADHD governance style which has whipsawed markets, Nordstrom remains on track to hit its 2025 guidance—no easy task in today's unpredictable economic landscape. The company's loyal, high-income customer base provides resilience during economic uncertainty. Nordstrom's digital investments are paying dividends with robust online growth, while its brick-and-mortar footprint remains strategically valuable in prime locations. The stock currently trades at attractive valuations compared to historical averages, suggesting significant upside potential as discretionary spending rebounds. Nordstrom's management team has demonstrated discipline in inventory management and cost controls while maintaining the premium shopping experience that differentiates the brand. Their focus on exclusive merchandise partnerships and personalized styling services creates competitive advantages that pure e-commerce players struggle to replicate. Seattle's global coffee empire is positioned for renewed growth after recent operational challenges. Starbucks' unmatched brand loyalty and extensive retail network of over 38,000 stores worldwide provide enormous competitive advantages. The company's strategic initiatives under new leadership are addressing operational inefficiencies while expanding digital capabilities and strengthening customer connections. Starbucks delivered a standout quarterly performance that surpassed analyst expectations across key metrics, including comparable store sales and operating margins. The company has projected $0.67 per share in the third quarter versus $0.41 per share in the second quarter. Despite navigating supply chain disruptions and consumer spending fluctuations caused by the administration's erratic policy shifts that have whipsawed markets, the company confidently reaffirmed its 2025 guidance—demonstrating remarkable operational discipline in an unpredictable environment. Starbucks continues to see strong international growth, particularly in China where the company is expanding its footprint despite near-term economic headwinds. The brand's ongoing menu innovation and premium positioning allow it to maintain pricing power even in inflationary environments. The company's rewards program boasts over 30 million active members in the U.S. alone, driving repeat business and higher average tickets. Recent stock price weakness presents an attractive entry point for long-term investors, with the company's robust free cash flow supporting both dividend growth and share repurchases. Starbucks' dividend yield currently exceeds historical averages, providing income while investors wait for the growth initiatives to fully materialize. LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - DECEMBER 04: An Alaska Airlines plane takes off from Los Angeles ... More International Airport (LAX) on December 4, 2023 in Los Angeles, California. Alaska Airlines has announced it plans to purchase rival Hawaiian Airlines in a $1.9 billion deal which must be approved by federal regulators. (Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images) This Seattle-based airline has built a reputation for operational excellence and customer satisfaction. Alaska Air Group has successfully integrated Virgin America while expanding its routes and partnerships to create a more competitive national network. The carrier's strong presence along the West Coast positions it ideally to benefit from the region's economic dynamism and population growth. Alaska Air's quarterly results flew past expectations with impressive load factors and revenue per available seat mile, despite the turbulence created by volatile fuel prices and changing travel regulations. Alaska expects to earn $1.54 per share in the third quarter on $3.5 billion in revenue, up from $3.2 billion in the second quarter. The airline has skillfully navigated the unpredictable policy environment—characterized by the current administration's ADHD governance style that has whipsawed markets—and remains firmly on course to achieve its ambitious 2025 financial and operational targets. Alaska's fleet modernization program is improving fuel efficiency and reducing maintenance costs, strengthening its cost structure compared to legacy carriers. The company maintains one of the industry's strongest balance sheets with relatively low debt levels, providing financial flexibility to weather industry cyclicality and invest in growth opportunities. The airline's loyalty program and credit card partnerships generate high-margin revenue streams that complement its core operations. Alaska's management team has demonstrated disciplined capacity growth and pricing strategies that prioritize profitability over market share. Recent expansion into premium cabin offerings addresses higher-yield business travelers while maintaining its value proposition for leisure customers. SEATTLE, WA - (Photo by Donald Miralle/Getty Images ) These three companies exemplify the broader economic strengths of Washington state. While federal finances deteriorate, Seattle-based enterprises benefit from the state's fiscal discipline, educated workforce, and innovation ecosystem. Investors seeking refuge from national economic challenges would be wise to consider these Washington state stalwarts for their portfolios. Their combination of established market positions, turnaround potential, and exposure to the dynamic Pacific Northwest economy offers compelling long-term value.
