Today's Digital Daily Today's Digital Daily Bain & Co. report details strategic resolutions for retailers, while also highlighting growth in non-store sales. Executive Editor According to a research report from the retail team at Bain & Co., nominal U.S. retail sales are pegged to see a 4 percent increase, year-over-year, in 2025 — “barring major macroeconomic or geopolitical shocks,” the firm noted. The report also included “resolutions” that successful retailers are focusing on this year. “That equates to around $5.2 trillion in estimated total sales in 2025,” the authors of the report said. “It’s a strong outlook, given a stagnant consumer outlook, tempering inflation, negative [year-over-year] employment trends, diminishing consumer savings, rising credit card delinquencies, elevated nondiscretionary costs and potential trade disruptions.” Related Articles Beauty Features EXCLUSIVE: Milk Makeup Is Launching at Ulta Beauty Furniture Salone del Mobile.Milano Planning Saudi Edition as Italian Design Firms Expand Retail Footprint The Bain advisers said they expect growth will be fueled by a 10 percent increase in non-store sales, “while in-store sales will see modest 2 percent gains, led by general merchandise, apparel, and health and personal care stores.” You May Also Like The report was written and compiled by Bain partners Aaron Cheris, Kurt Grichel, Marc-André Kamel and Darrell Rigby as well as Stephanie Koszyk, practice director. “Retailers face a pivotal moment in 2025,” the report’s authors said. “The challenges of shifting consumer behaviors and demands, economic volatility, regulatory changes and trade complexities persist, reshaping the retail game. Successful businesses will go beyond the familiar, tapping into cutting-edge technologies, reimagining loyalty programs and fortifying supply chains against an unpredictable global backdrop.” The report said that while headwinds remain, “opportunities such as potential interest rate cuts, tax incentives and momentum from a strong 2024 holiday season suggest 2025 may be a year in which innovative moves can set the stage for lasting success.” Regarding resolutions for success, the Bain report said companies should take cues from “scale players” such as Walmart and Amazon (with large assortments, along with Costco). The report’s authors said these brands “have become the go-to for many shoppers, accounting for 57 percent of retail growth over the last three quarters and 17 percent of total U.S. retail sales in 2024 — a 6-percentage-point increase from 2014.” The firm said competing directly with these giants is harder than ever. “But by crafting a unique value proposition, retailers can carve out a winning position alongside them and capture significant rewards.” Bain said a clear and compelling value proposition starts “with the fundamentals, be it fast shipping, consistent quality or reliable digital experiences. Miss here, and irrelevance is almost inevitable.” The fundamentals include having balanced assortments that cater to customer preferences, which can boost sales by 2 to 5 percent. “Private brands are becoming an especially powerful tool, adding value through exclusivity,” Bain said noting that the firm’s research shows high-performing private brands can boost grocer share of wallet by 12 percentage points. Pricing and promotions will also be a key to success. “Strong value perception doesn’t always mean chasing the lowest price,” the report stated. “Retailers with a competitive advantage build structured pricing architectures that align with their customer and product strategies, balancing margin growth and market share. Personalized promotions tailored to individual preferences can further enhance value perception and influence buying behavior — ultimately improving ROI.” With the supply chain, Bain recommends diversifying supplier sourcing, which involves retailers adopting “right-shoring strategies” to optimize operations balancing cost, resilience and speed. The firm said the focus is not on shifting entirely to one region, but creating a flexible system capable of addressing priorities such as response times, market proximity, or resource access during volatility. Bain said its research showed that about 70 percent of retailers said they intend to augment onshoring or nearshoring in the next three years, with many U.S. companies lessening dependence on China in favor of regions such as India or North America. For example, Steve Madden plans to cut imports from China by 40 percent to 45 percent next year by establishing alternative production and sourcing in different countries. The footwear brand was one of the first to act in response to an announcement of possible tariffs on China from the administration of President Donald Trump.The report’s authors said optimizing networks with “digital twins” can also mitigate sourcing challenges. Digital twin platforms are virtual models that use real-time data to test the impact of different variables. Retailers are adopting these platforms to simulate disruptive scenarios such as weather or labor shortages, allowing for quick network adjustments and long-term strategic planning. Integrated with real-time tracking for comprehensive visibility, digital twins help pinpoint vulnerabilities, enhance processes and strengthen supply chains.In addition, predictive analytics are increasingly used for smarter inventory management, enabling retailers to anticipate demand shifts and optimize stock levels effectively. “Amid fast-changing consumer preferences and frequent disruptions, precise forecasting is crucial,” the report’s authors said. “AI-powered tools can help analyze demand in real-time, allowing retailers to dynamically adjust inventory placement to reduce transit times, lower costs and prevent costly stockouts or excess inventory. Bain’s experience shows custom AI forecasting models can cut excess inventory by 40 percent and boost accuracy by nearly 50 percent compared to manual planning.” Sign up for WWD news straight to your inbox every day Get all the top news stories and alerts straight to your inbox.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Fundamental Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) stands against other best fundamental stocks to buy now. The S&P 500 index closed 0.3% lower at 6,101.24 on Friday, January 24, reversing its course after hitting a fresh intraday record earlier in the session. The Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average also slipped, with the former dropping 0.5% to 19,954.30 and the latter falling 140.82 points to 44,424.25. This marked the end of a four-day winning streak for the three major indexes. The decline was largely attributed to investors taking profits, particularly in mega-cap tech stocks. Despite this, the market remains bullish, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq posting their second consecutive positive week, rising 1.7% and 1.7% respectively. The Dow climbed 2.2% over the same period. In other news, President Trump made headlines on Thursday by calling for interest rates to drop immediately and asking Saudi Arabia and other OPEC nations to lower the price of oil. Market participants are closely watching the President’s statements, which have had a significant impact on the market. However, the market’s optimism is largely driven by President Donald Trump’s pro-business policies, which have boosted risk assets. Investors are also relieved that the President has only made threats on the tariff front, rather than taking formal action, during his first few days in office.

In an interview with CNBC on January 23, Mike Bailey, Director of Research at FBB Capital Partners, discussed the current state of the market. He noted that companies have had a great quarter, which reflects the fact that the economy is doing well, people have jobs, and they’re buying things, which trickles down to the market. This, in turn, has a positive impact on the tech sector as a whole. However, Bailey advised investors to take a more nuanced approach and consider the specific fundamentals of each company. Bailey believes that large-cap companies have the greatest opportunity to meet or exceed investor expectations for growth. He noted that while small caps are trading cheaper, they may not be the best option for long-term investments or high-conviction plays. Bailey explained that his firm’s approach is focused on identifying companies with strong earnings growth potential, and larger cap companies tend to have more resources and a stronger track record of delivering on their growth promises. However, he did acknowledge that small caps can be a good option for investors who are looking to capitalize on a short-term economic cycle or recovery. Bailey emphasized the importance of looking beyond the top ten stocks that make up 50% of the market, which often dominate the conversation. He suggested that there are plenty of other companies that are worth considering. These companies, according to Bailey, offer a compelling combination of growth potential, valuation, and dividend yield, making them attractive options for investors looking to diversify their portfolios. Furthermore, Bailey emphasized the importance of having a long-term perspective and not getting caught up in short-term market fluctuations. He encouraged investors to focus on the underlying fundamentals of each company and to avoid making emotional decisions based on market volatility. Large-cap companies with stable revenue and consistent net income growth remain attractive options for investors seeking reliable returns and long-term stability.

Title: Thinking about Getting a Costco Membership? Here's How Much You Can Save

Our expert, award-winning staff selects the products we cover and rigorously researches and tests our top picks. If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Reviews ethics statement Costco offers deals on bulk groceries, home essentials and more. But exactly how much can you save? I did the math. A Costco membership can save you more than $1,000 yearly in groceries alone. Groceries are the biggest ongoing expense for most families after housing, and they've seen an annoying uptick since the pandemic and all its supply chain chaos. In fact, the price of food rose 25% from 2019 to 2023, according to the US Department of Agriculture. One way to combat high supermarket prices is buying in bulk and nowhere is that more easily done that at Costco -- if you have one in your town or city. At Costco, groceries are packaged in larger quantities and sold at cheaper per-pound prices, meaning you can save major dough as long as you have the space to store a 50-pack of paper towels or a 20-pound bag of rice. Shopping at Costco also typically means fewer trips to the store, which translates to less gas. To see exactly how much money you can save by buying bulk groceries from Costco, I decided to price out a grocery list at the wholesale club and a more typical grocery store. After running the numbers, it's possible to save over $1,000 in one year by shopping at Costco instead of a supermarket. Below is a breakdown of how I reached that figure. (And if you get a Costco Executive membership, you could save even more.) Using grocery list templates available online, I assembled a list of 25 typical, staple grocery items that are suitable for longer storage, either in the pantry, refrigerator or freezer. This ruled out most fresh produce with some exceptions. If you're hosting a large gathering, buying produce in bulk may be worthwhile. Bulk shopping doesn't mean buying a year's worth of groceries all at once, but I didn't include anything that wouldn't hold up well for at least a month, with the notion that bulk grocery shopping can be done less often. Bulk buying also requires spending more upfront, which is why Costco's per-item total is considerably higher than Stop & Shop's. Assuming either bi-weekly or monthly consumption of those staple grocery items for a household of one or two people, I came up with the approximate yearly consumption for each. I chose Stop & Shop to represent a conventional grocery retailer, as it's largely considered to be a quality store with median prices, and Costco to represent bulk buying, as its Kirkland Signature products have a bit of a following in their own right -- Costco is the Trader Joe's of the bulk set, for sure. Unless a national brand is otherwise indicated, I used Stop & Shop's SB brand, or the least expensive name-brand product for a given item, to compare to Costco's Kirkland Signature brand. For the Stop & Shop items, coming up with the yearly price for each item was a simple matter of multiplying by 26 for bi-weekly consumption, or 12 for monthly consumption. For Costco's items, I scaled the prices accordingly based on whatever package size Costco offers to indicate a yearly cost for the same amount of a given item. If you can afford the freezer space, buying meat in bulk will save you big money over the course of a year. Since I was primarily interested in food cost savings, I didn't factor in cleaning supplies, paper products or other items, but you can safely assume these also amount to big saving potential over the year when bought in bulk. Also, since my calculations were based on a small household, the bigger your household, the bigger the savings. Costco requires a membership to take advantage of its bulk savings and low-cost signature brands. A basic membership costs $65 a year and is valid at all locations.

Producers, distributors and retailers are able to offer lower prices this way not only because bulk items often require less packaging, but also because for them it's a sure sale over a potential sale -- they'd rather have your money now, even at a discount, than parsed out over a period of time. Shelf-stable items including cereal, sauces and coffee make up some of the biggest savings when buying in bulk. Given this particular grocery list, buying in bulk would allow you to save over $1,000 during the course of a year, representing a 33% savings overall over conventional groceries. (In today's economy, it is worth mentioning that you also save gas money with fewer trips to the store.) In a few cases, the Stop & Shop item ended up being the cheaper option: organic milk, carrots, potatoes and frozen salmon filets, for example. In all of these cases, there wasn't a huge size difference between the conventional and bulk items. Milk is an especially good example, as it's still offered in a larger quantity at Costco, but there's only so much of it you can buy at one time without risking it spoiling, and so the bulk offering is comparatively modest. Costco also doesn't have a Kirkland brand offering of organic milk, whereas Stop & Shop does. The savings for bulk fresh produce were not as significant as pantry staples and shelf-stable groceries. Generally speaking, the larger the scale on the bulk item, the larger the savings. If you buy a 40-ounce quantity of Cheerios, for example, rather than the 12 ounces you get in a typical box, they become nearly 75% cheaper. Buying 25 pounds of white rice all at once instead of 2 pounds at a time saves you 60%. With at least a grand in savings available yearly for just a portion of your grocery list, even if you need to buy additional home storage to accommodate it, the verdict is clear: Bulk grocery shopping is well worth the effort. Some of the biggest savings by percentage come from shelf-stable and pantry items including chips, crackers, jarred sauce, rice and whole-bean coffee. These items are typically easier to store and less likely to spoil or deteriorate in quality. Buying pantry items in bulk from a discount grocer such as Costco represents a clear and risk-free strategy for saving money on your grocery bill over the course of a year.
