I've worked at Costco's membership counter for over 19 years. Throughout my time at the warehouse, I've picked up a few tips to help save money and grab my favorite items before they're gone. Here are eight tips I use almost every day so I don't miss out on groceries and items at Costco. I think Costco's executive option is the best way to get your money's worth and make the most out of your membership. Although it's twice the cost of a gold-star membership at $130, the executive membership gives customers 2% back on most purchases, including at the pharmacy and tire shop, and on optical and hearing-aid services. Cardholders usually get their 2% reward in the mail two months prior to renewal time and may use it for future purchases or their next membership fee. Executive members can also receive up to $1,250 on qualified Costco purchases annually. Just keep in mind that certain products — including tobacco, gasoline, Costco cash cards, and postage stamps — are excluded from the 2% cash-back reward. If you buy something at full value and it decreases in price, you might be able to take advantage of Costco's price and coupon adjustments 30 days from the date of purchase. Bring in your original receipt and head to the refund counter to try for your adjustment. If you can't find your receipt, just simply ask a team member at the counter to help you out. If you purchase something online and notice a difference in the price, go to Costco.com under "rebates" and do a price adjustment yourself. Signs with the asterisk at the upper-right corner mean it's time to stock up because Costco will not be restocking that item. If you enjoy a product, make sure to check its sign occasionally. Employees at Costco's membership counter can also check if any surrounding warehouses will continue to restock that item. Prices ending in .97 or .00 are on sale. Most markdown prices mean the warehouse is trying to get rid of it, or it's a seasonal item. That being said, prices may vary per location. Kirkland Signature is Costco's own brand and has products that are comparable to more mainstream brands. To me, it's worth trying Kirkland Signature items because Costco offers a satisfaction-guarantee policy. If you're unhappy, you can usually return the item for a full refund. Downloading the Costco app before your shopping trip can be very useful because you can see what's on sale as you shop or even before your trip. You can also access your membership card (which may even eliminate the need to bring your physical card) receipts, online orders, any 2% reward balance, and your Costco Anywhere visa card — if you have one — through the app. Costco doesn't provide grocery bags, but there are boxes available to help pack your items, usually toward the exit of the store. I also recommend bringing some reusable bags to make packing up your shopping go smoother. This story was originally published on May 2, 2023, and most recently updated on November 1, 2024. Jump to

Heavenly Homemakers Encouraging women in homemaking, healthy eating and parenting November 1, 2024 by Laura 2 Comments Here’s our Big Family Grocery Spending for October, 2024 post! Here’s how we spent our grocery budget for our large household during the month of October. We fed 14 people three meals each day, plus a lot of wonderful guests… 1. Sam’s On October 3, we had a huge grocery stock-up trip at Sam’s. We got potatoes, grapes, strawberries, nectarines, spinach, tomato soup, hamburger meat, chicken thighs, meat sticks, snacks, peanut butter, honey, milk, cream, eggs, shredded cheese, pistachios, olive oil, coconut oil, brown sugar, condiments, chicken broth, yogurt and applesauce pouches, tomato sauce, spaghetti sauce, maple syrup, coffee, bacon, white queso, and avocado cups. Total for groceries at Sam’s: $582.44 2. Hy-Vee Pick-Up That same day, I had put a pick-up order in at Hy-Vee for some of our WIC items for our girls for the month. Malorie picked it up for me, which was a huge help. Total out of pocket at Hy-Vee: $0 3. Aldi On October 10, Malorie and I took the four littlest to Aldi. I mostly needed milk and salsa, but since it’s tough to get to the store and we were already there, I stocked up on many of our favorite Aldi items: Milk, Yogurt, Granola, Fruit/Veggie Pouches, a case of Salsa, Sausage, Grass Fed Beef (on sale!), Coffee Creamer, Organic Pears, Bananas, Blackberries, Sliced Ham, Frozen Fries, Canned Fruit in 100% juice, and Clementines. Total for groceries at Aldi: $207.71 4. Costco On October 16, Auggie and I went to Costco to stock up on fresh fruit and veggies plus other Costco favorites/needs. We got 6 pounds of strawberries, 2 containers of raspberries, bananas, spring mix, spinach, grapes, 6 pounds of apples, a large bag of oranges, applesauce cups, mandarin orange cups, peach cups, frozen fruit for smoothies, cocoa powder, chicken nuggets, fries, applesauce pouches, yogurt pouches, heavy whipping cream, half and half, sliced cheese, cream cheese, frozen meatballs, avocado cups, canned pumpkin, frozen pizza, turkey lunch meat, and butter. Total for groceries at Costco: $360.31 5. Walmart I needed Walmart that day too but didn’t have time, so I put in a pick-up order for Matt to grab while he was out that afternoon. My order that day was mostly non-grocery, but we also got milk, pickle relish, wheat germ, cheese, carrots, and Caesar salad. I forgot to take a picture. :/ Total for food at Walmart: $29.68 6. Amazon We have a standing order of subscribe and save items from Amazon, which is mostly applesauce and yogurt pouches. I also get these pizza crusts for cheap, x2. Again, no picture. :) Total for food from Amazon: $51.97 7. Wal-Mart On October 24, Auggie and I went to Wal-mart to finish picking up our WIC items for the month. I also got 8 pie crusts, coffee creamer, fritos, a 4-pound chunk of Colby jack cheese, and a jar of jelly. I always check for meat markdowns at Walmart because that’s one way I save a lot on meat for our family. This day I got a roast for $4.92 per pound, which is a higher than my preferred price point for meat, but still a really good price for beef. I also got four big packages of boneless chicken thighs marked down to just $2.02 or $1.98/pound. AMAZING! I checked out and loaded the van, then Auggie and I went in for round two – a cart full of fruits and veggies. WIC covered most of the produce cost that day. I got frozen fruit for smoothies, frozen peas, green beans, and corn, frozen fajita veggies, fresh baby carrots, regular carrots, Caesar salad, broccoli, cilantro, potatoes, spring mix, spinach, mandarins, pears, grapes, mushrooms, blueberries, and bananas. Total out of pocket at Wal-mart: $113.63 — > Without WIC, our total this month would have been closer to $1,545. <—– Running totals for 2024: January: $1,178 February: $849 March: $1,356 April: $1148 May: 1091 June: $1,121 July: $1,190 August: $1,611 September: $1,218 October: $1,345 Filed Under: Big Family Food, Feeding the Family Tagged With: aldi, costco, grocery budget, healthy eating, hy-vee, large family grocery spending, sam's, wal-mart Shelby H. says November 1, 2024 at 11:13 am I always enjoy reading about how you manage grocery shopping for a big family!

Title: Uber Bull Calls Grow Ahead of Earnings After Tesla's Robotaxi Event Underwhelmed

Uber Technologies (UBER) will report earnings for the third quarter before the opening bell on Thursday, with the ridesharing giant expected to report a substantial rise in profits and revenue from the same time last year. Uber is expected to report revenue just shy of $11 billion, nearly 20% above last year's $9.29 billion, according to estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. Net Income is expected to roughly quadruple to $897.96 million, up from $221 million. Analysts are overwhelmingly bullish on Uber stock, with all 27 analysts tracked by Visible Alpha rating it as a "buy," with an average price target of $91.12, about 14% above Tuesday's intraday price of $79.55. Several analysts reiterated their bullish stances on Uber following Tesla's (TSLA) robotaxi unveiling earlier this month, with lack of details on Tesla's plans leading Jefferies analysts to call the event a "best-case outcome" for Uber. Bank of America analysts said Uber's revenue growth in the quarter should be "aided" by new products and features like taxis and new partnerships for Uber Eats with Costco (COST). They also said the company appears confident features like autonomous vehicles (AVs) and increased availability of ride-reserving could boost revenue in 2025. Uber has announced a number of partnerships with AV companies like Waymo over the last several months, with the partnerships and Tesla's lackluster robotaxi event improving analyst outlooks on Uber. Bank of America analysts said they see "limited competitive threats" to Uber from Tesla's AVs in the near term, as Tesla CEO Elon Musk offered few specifics about how the company's AV ecosystem will work when they are eventually on the roads. Jefferies analysts said Uber could be "uniquely well-positioned" to grow its partnerships with AV companies, as Uber's ecosystem of users gives the companies a platform to rent their vehicles without building and managing their own rental service or app. Uber shares have gained close to 30% since the start of the year, though down from record levels reached in the days following Tesla's robotaxi event.
