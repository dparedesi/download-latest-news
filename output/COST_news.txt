I've long been a fan of Costco and its mega-sized product offerings, especially when it comes to items my family uses a lot. I often hit the warehouse store for essentials, like milk and coffee, and have even trusted Costco to handle my Thanksgiving dinner in years past. However, I haven't used my membership to shop for my holiday gifting and entertaining needs until this year. Recently, I headed to my local Costco in search of seasonal deals and any items that would come in handy for all the holiday entertaining my family does — and I was pleasantly surprised. Here are 12 of the best offerings I discovered while shopping at Costco this holiday season. Whether you're picking up this Dyson stick vac to help yourself get the house clean after all those holiday gatherings, or you're gifting it to someone else, $230 off is a pretty impressive deal. This wet/dry vacuum is typically priced over $500, but Costco members can grab it for just $330 through the end of December. As someone with lots of pets and a family of four to clean up after, this is an item I'd gladly pick up for myself or add to my Christmas wish list. The holidays are all about time spent together, but sometimes it's nice to get a break from all the cooking (and clean-up) that comes along with this time of year. My 17-year-old son and 15-year-old daughter love eating cinnamon rolls after we open gifts on Christmas morning, but I love the idea of making my morning easier with premade options. This pan of Kirkland Signature heat-and-serve cinnamon rolls is just $13. The time I'll save on Christmas morning alone makes them worth the price, which works out to about $2 per roll. My husband enjoys cooking just as much as I do, and we love using our Vitamix for everything from making soups to creating fun homemade ice creams. A Vitamix would make a perfect gift for any foodie on your holiday shopping list, and the $100 discount is an even greater reason to pick one up at Costco. These savings are also a good excuse to pick one up for yourself, too. A big fan of holiday charcuterie boards throughout the season, I squealed when I found this cute two-pack kit containing kits to make a chalet and tree out of meats, cheeses, olives, and other bites. For $20, it's a great item to pick up and store in the fridge for impromptu holiday gatherings or as a fun way to impress dinner guests. I grabbed a $15 robe for my teenage daughter, as she had been asking for something cozy to wear while getting ready for quite a while. Available in pink and white, these fluffy Room Service robes are usually $19 at Costco, but were $4 off during my trip. Other Room Service robes cost twice as much online, so this felt like a great Costco-exclusive deal to me. I have fond memories of a neighbor who brought me Costco chicken pot pies to help simplify dinnertime both times I had a baby. Since then, they've become something I take to friends who are sick, grieving, or need a little pick-me-up. The ready-to-bake pies are packed with chicken, can serve a large group, and are so easy to pop in the oven. They're great for keeping on hand to feed unexpected guests, or to take to holiday potlucks. Now is a great time to stock up on them, as they're $4 off. My teens see a lot of movies with their friends, so this AMC Theatres gift pack caught my eye right away. For about $40, you can gift the film enthusiast in your life two movie tickets and a $20 digital AMC gift card (perfect for using on snacks). During my shopping trip, the set was $5 off, bringing the total to just $35. This deal is perfect as a gift or stocking stuffer. A few years ago, my teen daughter started asking for her own Dyson hair dryer. I love mine, but I was hesitant to buy another for my kid, given the high price tag. However, the nearly $500 hair dryer is $130 off at Costco, making it just $360. This is one of the best prices I've seen. If there's ever been a time to buy a Dyson for your hair-care-obsessed teen, this may be it. I buy Sand + Fog candles often because they tend to smell amazing and last a long time. The brand's 57-ounce candles are originally $40, but are $6 off at Costco right now. The giant size means they're bound to last the recipient of your gift well into the new year. When I saw this deal on one of my favorite candle brands, I immediately started thinking of who they'd make great gifts for, from teachers to hairdressers. I'm always looking for stocking-stuffer ideas for my husband and teens, and these eos lip balms are exactly the type of thing I like to gift. After all, everyone could use a balm for chapped lips, especially throughout the cooler winter months. Right now, this pack of nine eos lip balms is on sale for $17 at Costco, meaning each costs less than $2. These $20 bouquets of two-dozen roses are my go-to hostess gift, birthday present, and treat for myself. Available in tons of colors, these Costco florals typically last for a long time and are an easy-but-elegant gift to grab for people on your list who may be hard to shop for. They're also perfect for displaying in your own home during the holiday entertaining season, so pick up an extra bouquet for yourself while you're loading up your cart. My teens complain about many hand-sanitizer brands, saying they smell bad or dry out their hands too much. Thankfully, they both like Touchland hand sanitizer sprays, so I keep them in my car and purse to use when we're on the go. While at Costco, I grabbed a four-pack of Touchland sprays for $30 to put into my family's stockings. This felt like a steal because Touchland normally charges $12 per sanitizer. I'd recommend stopping at Costco during the holiday season if you're looking for savings on electronics or ideas for affordable stocking stuffers. In addition to scoring big discounts on the bigger-ticket items my teens and husband have asked for, I grabbed several other gifts at Costco. The wholesale retailer is also a great spot for those entertaining guests this holiday season, whether they need premade cinnamon rolls or creative charcuterie displays. I'm a huge fan of lessening my own workload during the holidays so I can spend more time with my family, and Costco seemed to be the perfect place to do just that. Jump to

A group of underdogs surviving within a rigid system by finding clever ways to outsmart it might sound like the plot of a dystopian movie. But despite how fictional that storyline seems, in a world of 8 billion people, a few out-of-the-box free-thinkers exist. Those who want the thrill of rebellion without the guilt of breaking the rules have discovered clever loopholes that let them legally bypass certain situations without actually breaking the law. These ingenious workarounds may sound strange, yet the people who’ve cracked the code and use them repeatedly swear by them, despite how sketchy they might seem. Scroll below to read a few dependable methods Redditors have been using to take advantage of the system that feel completely illegal when you use them, and have been sharing online so others can use them too.

Image source: anon Saying that I will not answer any questions about my medical history unless it is pertinent to the medical information that I *chose* to disclose in order to receive the necessary accommodations. Under HIPAA laws, non government employers are prohibited from asking you for a your medical history, unless you have been diagnosed with any condition or disorder that will 75% prevent you from doing your job. In my case, I have epilepsy, and so I disclosed it and what accommodations I needed. My employer told me that they needed a doctor’s note or letter regarding the diagnosis in order to approve it, and I supplied it. However, when one of the big wigs asked me for one year’s worth of health records, I casually said, “That’s not pertinent to the letter that I sent in, or the diagnosis that required the accommodation letter. You can not ask me for a year’s worth of records, and if you ask again, I will be on the phone with a HIPAA lawyer before you can even blink.”. Image source: KhaosIncarnate5 DoorDash (& other delivery) would mess up my order but if an entire item wasn’t missing, they’d do a tiny partial refund even though I didn’t receive the food I ordered. Forcing me to pay for food I didn’t order. Example: I could order a cheeseburger with onion rings, bacon, BBQ sauce and just receive a plain cheeseburger, and they’d say since it was just missing a few toppings I’d only get a couple bucks back. Basically forcing me to pay full price for an item I didn’t even ask for. Another example: ordering a pizza with pepperoni and jalapenos, having it arrive with only jalapenos. I’d get a $2.50 refund for a missing topping and be stuck with a pizza I didn’t order. Loophole: in the examples above, rather than say my bacon cheeseburger was missing toppings, I’d just say the entire item was missing. I’d tell them I received a burger, but not the burger I ordered, which isn’t lying. My bacon cheeseburger was completely missing and I got someone else’s burger instead. Same with the pizza– it wasn’t just missing a topping, I ordered one pizza and got something completely different. It’s a different way to frame it, but it isn’t dishonest and it’s important because if you got the wrong item, it’s a full refund. If an item was prepared incorrectly, you get hardly anything except food you didn’t ask for. Image source: anon Libraries: It feels like I’m stealing to get a book or movie and take my time with it and give it back when I am done. Image source: GlassCharacter179 TLDR: You can bill a doctor for YOUR time. I have narcolepsy and 18 years ago when we were getting it all sorted out I had to go to the neurologist every month to check in and re-up my prescription (a controlled substance, so they would only do 1 month at a time). Literally every single time I showed up on time and waited 1 hour+ in the waiting room, then they’d put me in the private room where you sit on paper and I’d wait usually another half hour to hour before the Dr. would come in and spend 6 minutes with me. Every time I left the office I paid my copay and every time they made me sign a paper that stated the Dr’s time is valuable and if a patient is more than 5 minutes late for an appointment they’d be billed accordingly (this detail matters for later). I’m pretty patient so I just let it slide for a while. Then one day my insurance changed, I gave them my new insurance info when I paid my copay after my visit. Then a couple months later they sent me a bill for something like $3,000! Turns out they mistakenly tried billing my old insurance for one visit, which obviously didn’t work, so then they tried to get me to pay the absolutely insane amount (for the Dr.’s 6 minutes of time). This was their mistake and I wasn’t going to pay it but they weren’t going to let it go. They told me they would send me to collections. So, I strung them along for several more months to avoid collections and while I was doing that I very carefully and accurately tracked every minute I waited past my scheduled appointment times (remember I went in every 4 weeks). Then I wrote them a letter that was very directly modeled after their “the dr’s time is valuable” letter, it stated that my time is valuable and that starting 10 minutes after my appointment time the Dr is considered late for our appointment and that I would be billing for my time. I stated that I was going to graciously forgive the previous year+ of tardiness but itemized all of my time he had wasted for the last 3-4 months. I came up with a personal hourly rate that made my bill to them about $4,500. They immediately dropped the charges and miraculously I never waited more than about 15 minutes again. Image source: pillageTHENburn Image source: 7empestSpiralout, Vitaly Gariev There’s a Tractor Supply (the store) online hack, where you can search any store in the US on the website, find your item cheaper than your local store. Add it to cart and then right before you pay, change the pickup location to your local store. The price stays the same as the cheaper store. I saved a ton of money on stall mats for my home gym this way. Ordering no ice at Starbucks and asking for a cup of ice on the side. They fill your cup up all the way with no extra charge. Makes no sense. Doesn’t work good for espresso drinks but for iced coffee, cold brew, and refreshers, you’re just getting double the drink for free.

One coupon was for $2 off any item, so I got a $2 bottle of water and they just let me take it for free. Felt amazing. I saw a concert at a venue that didn’t let you leave and re-enter once you were inside. I was telling the merch guy I wanted to buy a poster but not have to hold it all night. He said “just say you have asthma and you need your inhaler, if it’s a medical issue they’re not allowed to ask you any questions.” I was hesitant because I really didn’t want to not get let back in, and he was like “cmon, come with me.” He goes to the door, tells security “hey, this kid has asthma, he needs to go get his inhaler.” I took off running, not even thinking about the connection, brought the poster back to my car, walked back to the side entrance, they stopped me and I was like “I was just in there!” and they were like “eh let him go.” I actually still feel a little guilty about it, but it definitely worked! Gave the merch guy a fist bump. Image source: wossquee Image source: youvegotnail, welcomia I install windows and trim them out.

Edit- to clarify as best I can: -We don’t have the space to store a lot of boards, so if we have a say 4’ cutoff it generally goes in the dumpster unless someone wants it. Someone always takes those for a shelf or something or for a job the next day that we know we can use it for. -I want it, because I have use for 4’ boards. -it’s encouraged for us to take home cut offs, but not full 16’ or 8’ boards. We save those. -it’s unfortunate we can’t store those cuttoffs because they are often all we need. I bring those when we need them. -my boss says that once it hits the dumpster it’s mine. I supply 4 4’ boards from my own house, I’m owed 16 lf. I take home a full 16 footer because I’m swimming in scraps, but sometimes need full boards. -my boss is aware this is dysfunctional.

Title: How CEO Winnie Park is reshaping Five Below into 'Costco for kids'

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Christmas, it is often said, is a time for second chances. So it would seem for Five Below, which is celebrating a transformational year under the leadership of CEO Winnie Park. The stock is up about 85% this year so far — that's well more than the returns of most major retail stocks and AI chip darling Nvidia in the same period. To rewind, last year's holiday season wasn't looking like a very joyful one for the tween- and teen-focused retailer. The Philadelphia-based company was on its way to posting its fourth-straight quarter with negative or flat comparable sales, and that was coming off several prior years of underwhelming performance. While Five Below was managing to grow overall sales through the addition of new stores, existing stores weren't resonating with shoppers. It was also dealing with industry-wide challenges, including shoplifting and the rise of low-priced e-commerce players like Shein and Temu. With Five Below's stock languishing around a third of its 2023 peak, the company tapped Park, then-CEO of Forever 21, to take over as CEO in December 2024 during the holiday rush last year. "When she came in, she was sort of an unknown quantity," Mizuho retail analyst David Bellinger told Business Insider. "It was a question of how is she going to fix this business immediately." While Park may not have been the most widely known CEO on Wall Street, she did come equipped with decades of industry experience, including as CEO of Forever 21 and Paper Source, as well as executive roles at Duty Free Shoppers and Levi's, and a stint with McKinsey's retail team. "Her background allows her to really understand how all of these different aspects of the Five Below business work, because she's drawing on a very rich career," Global Data retail analyst Neil Saunders told Business Insider. "A lot of people come in sometimes as CEOs, and they don't have a tremendous background in retail, or they may have experience in merchandising, but not in supply chains," he added. "Winnie Park was almost like the complete package." Five Below did not respond to a request for comment on this story. Park wasted no time diving in with cofounder and executive chairman Tom Vellios and chief operating officer Ken Bull. The first order of business was refocusing the merchandise on what Five Below's core teen and tween customers want. Bellinger said this was a result of Park's major reset with the sourcing teams, guiding them to find hot items and buy with confidence, while steering away from items, like luggage, that were more adult-focused. "They loaded the store up with 'Lilo and Stitch' merchandise, SpongeBob, Hello Kitty — so when you do have these good, well-known brands, it sort of lifts the whole store," he said. The merchandising effort was also paired with a social media push that the company says has helped attract new shoppers. Park's other major area of focus was simplifying store operations for both employees and customers. With a bit of planning and an incremental investment in labor hours, Five Below says it has improved in-stock rates and customer support at its stores, helping to drive higher sales. "Winnie Park is the type of leader that has a very clear vision for the business," Saunders said. "She doesn't really overcomplicate things." In addition to getting Five Below back to some principles it may have lost touch with in recent years, Park is also showing a willingness to let go of at least one thing that may have been holding the company back: its $5 price point. The last few years of inflation haven't made it easy for retailers with dollar-denominated branding to stick to their original promises. Dollar Tree had to hike its base price to $1.25, and it's tough to run a 99 Cents Only store at a time when the US government is eliminating the penny. President Donald Trump's trade war this year hasn't been much help for import-heavy businesses, either. To manage these cost pressures, the company lumped more merchandise in a catch-all section of the store called Five Beyond, which it had set up years earlier. But that distinction brought unnecessary complexity without meaningful benefit, and the company recently ditched the plan in favor of grouping products by category instead of a price threshold. "It was a very disjointed merchandising set," Bellinger said. "Anything in that price threshold was in the back there." Now, he said, "the way they've assorted the store and spread these items out makes a lot more sense." Bellinger said the move shows that Park understands a critical lesson that successful retailers have had to reckon with in the last few years: value and price are not the same thing. "You could find value in that $30 item. It's all relative," he said. Taken together — exciting products, well-run stores, a focus on great value — Five Below is starting to look in some ways more like a warehouse club than a discount store. "Five Below is essentially the Costco for kids," Bellinger said. "Maybe you want to get some core birthday or party items, and then you wind up expanding your basket and buying all these things you didn't know were there. And then it leads you to your next visit, and you just keep coming back." The success of the past year will raise the expectations for next year's quarterly comparable sales numbers, but Five Below still has several levers it says it can pull to meet the moment. Bellinger said investors are keen to see whether the recent changes at Five Below have led to a structural shift that will drive long-term performance. The average Five Below store generates annual sales of around $2.1 million, but Bellinger said Park's initiatives could significantly boost that number: "Why can't that be a $3 million store now, or even higher?"
