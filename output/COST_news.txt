On Friday, BMO Capital adjusted its outlook on Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST), raising the stock's price target from $950.00 to $980.00. The firm has maintained an Outperform rating for the retailer. The revision follows Costco's reported earnings for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2024, which showed strong performance indicators, including better-than-expected gross margin percentages and comparable sales. The company's recent earnings report highlighted a robust increase in global customer traffic, up by 6%, with a significant 11-12% rise on a two-year stack basis. The strong performance metrics have led to an above-average growth in earnings per share (EPS) for the fiscal year 2024. Despite this growth, BMO Capital projects a more conservative EPS growth rate in the coming years, taking into account Costco's pattern of reinvesting market funds incrementally (MFI) increases. Costco's momentum in E-commerce was also a notable point in the analysis by BMO Capital. The retailer's continued expansion in the digital space is seen as a positive driver of its business model. While acknowledging that the company's valuation has reached new heights, the firm still finds Costco's stock attractive, citing the slightly higher EPS revisions as a basis for the increased price target. The analyst from BMO Capital highlighted the company's solid underlying financials in the fourth fiscal quarter, which surpassed the firm's forecasts. The statement underscored the strength in gross margins and comparable sales, which contributed to the positive outlook. "We continue to be encouraged by COST's momentum in Ecommerce growth and while valuation has expanded to new highs, COST remains attractive in our view," said the analyst from BMO Capital. With the new price target set at $980, BMO Capital's stance reflects confidence in Costco's ongoing growth trajectory and its ability to maintain a strong position in the market. The firm's analysis suggests a belief in the retailer's strategic investments and its potential for sustained financial success. In other recent news, Costco Wholesale reported mixed results in its fourth-quarter earnings, with earnings per share (EPS) of $5.29 surpassing both Goldman Sachs and consensus estimates, but falling slightly short on its revenue target of $79.70 billion. Despite the slight miss, same-store sales witnessed a 6.9% increase, exceeding the anticipated 6.4%. In response to potential disruptions due to a possible strike at U.S. ports, Costco's CEO, Ron Vachris, outlined extensive contingency plans. The company's recent performance has led to varied reactions from analyst firms. Baird maintains an Outperform rating on Costco with a price target of $975, highlighting the company's strong comparable sales momentum and healthy membership key performance indicators. However, Roth/MKM, DA Davidson, and Citi have maintained a Neutral stance, while Truist Securities, Redburn-Atlantic have expressed valuation concerns, downgrading or maintaining neutral stances on the company's shares. Goldman Sachs remains optimistic, maintaining a Buy rating and raising the price target to $995. These are recent developments for Costco Wholesale. As BMO Capital raises its price target for Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST), it's important to note some key financial metrics and insights that underscore the retailer's market position and valuation. According to InvestingPro data, Costco boasts a significant market capitalization of $399.64 billion, reflecting its substantial presence in the industry. The company's P/E ratio stands at a high 55.9, which, while indicative of investor confidence, also points to a premium valuation relative to near-term earnings growth. This is further emphasized by a PEG ratio of 2.86, suggesting that the market may be pricing in optimistic growth expectations. Costco's revenue growth remains healthy, with a 7.75% increase over the last twelve months as of Q3 2024, and a gross profit margin of 12.5%, which, although solid, may be considered modest in comparison to some industry peers. It's also noteworthy that Costco has maintained dividend payments for 21 consecutive years, with a recent dividend yield of 0.51% and a 13.73% dividend growth in the same period. This consistent return to shareholders reflects the company's financial health and disciplined capital management. InvestingPro Tips highlight that while Costco is trading at high earnings and EBITDA valuation multiples, it holds more cash than debt, indicating a strong balance sheet. Additionally, the company's cash flows can sufficiently cover interest payments, providing further evidence of its financial stability. For those seeking more in-depth analysis, InvestingPro offers additional tips, with a total of 15 tips available that delve into Costco's performance and market valuation.

The Federal Reserve's preferred measure of inflation is due this morning; U.S. stock futures are steady after Thursday's jump and the S&P 500's record close; Costco Wholesale (COST) shares are slipping in premarket trading after disappointing quarterly revenue numbers; almost 1.2 million electricity customers are without power in Florida as Helene slams the state as a Category 4 hurricane; and Intel (INTC) reportedly rebuffs a bid by Arm Holdings (ARM) for its product division. Here's what investors need to know today. Market watchers will be focused on the Fed's preferred inflation measure to gauge the future path of interest rates, after last week's half-percentage-point cut signaled the central bank's view that price pressures are easing. The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index is expected to have risen 2.3% year-over-year in August, down from 2.5% in July, according to a survey of economists by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal, but the "core" number is expected to have risen to 2.7% from 2.6%. U.S. stock futures are little changed after major indexes surged Thursday, with the S&P 500 closing at a record high after a strong earnings report from Micron (MU) sent chip stocks sharply higher and shares of companies with exposure to the Chinese economy jumped on reports of additional government stimulus. The Nasdaq finished higher for a fourth straight session yesterday, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average inched closer to another record high of its own. Costco Wholesale (COST) shares are slipping 1% in premarket trading after the warehouse retailer's quarterly revenue missed analysts' expectations as growth slowed. The company's fiscal fourth-quarter sales growth was just 1% year-over-year, offsetting earnings that topped forecasts. Investors will be watching how higher membership fees could affect the companyâ€™s results going forward. Hurricane Helene landed in Florida as a Category 4 storm Thursday night with wind speeds of around 140 miles per hour, with about 1.2 million customers losing power in the state, according to PowerOutage.us. Helene weakened to a tropical storm as it moved farther inland over Georgia, but a "life-threatening storm surge, winds, and heavy rains continue," the National Hurricane Center said. Troubled chipmaker Intel (INTC) has rejected a bid by chip designer Arm Holdings (ARM) for its product division, Bloomberg reported late Thursday. Earlier this week, the news outlet reported that Apollo Global Management had offered to invest as much as $5 billion in Intel, days after The Wall Street Journal said that Qualcomm (QCOM) had made a "takeover approach" for it. Intel shares, which are little changed in premarket trading, are down more than 50% this year. American depositary receipts (ADRs) of Arm are edging lower.

Costco Wholesale (COST) will report fiscal fourth-quarter earnings after the closing bell Thursday, with analysts projecting growth on the top and bottom linesâ€”but very little further appreciation for the shares. The membership-based bulk retailer has seen its stock climb about 40% this year. Of the 19 analysts tracked by Visible Alpha, 13 have a buy rating on Costco's stock. The consensus price target of $912.94 represents only a slim premium to Wednesday's close of $908.42. Costco is projected to report $2.27 billion in net income on just shy of $79.96 billion in revenue, up from $2.2 billion and $78.9 billion, respectively, a year earlier. Investors will be watching closely for the companyâ€™s first results since raising its membership price for the first time in seven years. Hereâ€™s what you need to know about Costcoâ€™s upcoming earnings report.
