ByJanice Gassam Asare, Ph.D., Senior Contributor. It was recently announced that Target’s CEO of 11 years, Brian Cornell, would be stepping down and Michael Fiddelke, 20-year Target veteran and the Chief Operating Officer, would be stepping in to replace him. Target’s stock has seen a considerable decline since the start of 2025. While some have attributed the company’s decline to Trump’s tariffs and the weakening economy, the company’s about-face when it came to DEI sparked backlash and criticism, leaving a bad taste in the mouths of many consumers. In February of 2025, prominent Atlanta pastor Dr. Jamal Bryant called for a boycott of Target in response to the company’s rollback of their DEI initiatives. The boycott, Bryant indicated, has been the most successful Black boycott since the Montgomery Bus Boycott that occurred 70 years ago. DEI is currently the nation’s favorite bogeyman; being blamed for everything from bridge collapses to plane crashes. There is still a lack of understanding regarding what DEI is, how it can positively impact employees and how it can benefit workplaces, contributing to some of the DEI pushback that has increased in recent months. Make no mistake; DEI is far from perfect, but the existence of workplace DEI programs often provides a pathway to address harm that takes place in the workplace. Many Black consumers saw Target’s decision to cut DEI initiatives as a slap in the face. The company was seemingly so outspoken with their support of Black businesses, pledging a $2 billion investment in Black-owned businesses after the murder of George Floyd. Consumers have become much more judicious with their spending, deciding to resist through their wallets. Costco has been an outspoken advocate of DEI, choosing not to flounder under pressure from DEI opponents, and has seen a net increase in sales, which many attribute to their doubling down of DEI. Target drew the public’s ire because unlike many of the companies that announced they were scaling back their DEI efforts in the past year, Target was one of the most ardent supporters of DEI through their racial equity agenda. With Target being headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the company was at ground zero following the tragic murder of George Floyd. The expectation was that their proximity to the tragedy would result in a true commitment to uplift the Black community, but less than five years later, the company reneged on their promises and pledges. In 1969, activist Fred Hampton was instrumental in spearheading the Rainbow Coalition, where different groups of people worked together to address a common issue. What made the coalition so successful is the power in numbers—multiple people working towards a shared goal is an effective way to combat societal ills. During the Montgomery Bus Boycotts, Black folks were able to inspire and mobilize people from outside the Black community to join their cause. What has made the Target boycott so successful has been a similar strategy from the boycott organizers. It hasn’t been only Black consumers who have been boycotting Target. Communities of other historically marginalized and excluded populations (Latinos, poor folks, the LGBTQIA+ community) have also mobilized to support the boycott. Different groups who knew that DEI rollbacks would impact their communities have come together after calls to boycott from leaders like Bryant. There is power in numbers but it’s important to note: when there is a critical mass of people working towards a shared goal, that goal can be accomplished, according to Harvard political scientist Erica Chenoweth. Chenoweth’s research indicated that only 3.5% of a population’s participation is needed to drive change. The question remains whether the hiring of a new CEO will resurrect Target’s image and thus their sales. In a recent CNN interview, Bryant noted that hiring an internal candidate who has been at the company for decades will not change the company’s engrained ideology or their stance on DEI. Contrary to the popular saying, companies that “go woke,” perhaps won’t actually go broke. Companies should learn from Target’s missteps; a commitment to ensuring that all employees are treated equitably and fairly is not a nice-to-have but a need-to-have. Both consumers and employees are watching; if your words don’t align with your actions, there will be a price to pay. Rather than swaying to appease investors, the DEI detractors, or this current administration, the longevity and sustainability of companies will ultimately be decided by how they treat their employees. People are not settling for crumbs—a failure to prioritize the wellbeing of workers will continue to have dire consequences.

Title: With The Rising Cost Of Groceries, Is It Cheaper To Just Eat Out?

On Assignment For HuffPost With grocery prices rising lately, sometimes it seems to make more sense to grab a bite at a restaurant or order DoorDash rather than buy groceries and cook at home. To find out whether this is really true, we spoke with experts — and found there are a number of factors you may not have considered. “Let’s be honest: Saying it’s always cheaper to eat out is like saying it’s cheaper to rent a tux every day instead of doing your laundry,” said Rocco Carulli, owner and executive chef at R House in Miami. “In reality it depends on what you order, how you shop and whether you’re actually using your fridge for food and not just beverages and expired condiments. Groceries can save you money — but only if you use what you buy and know how to turn raw ingredients into real meals. Restaurants can be efficient if you’re choosing well, stretching your portions or just accepting that you’re paying for peace of mind and a clean kitchen.” The current trend points to more people buying groceries than eating out. According to a Revenue Management Solutions survey, “40% of U.S. diners said they’re spending less of their disposable income on restaurants. Instead, many are turning to grocery stores: 1 in 4 consumers reported shopping there more often, with nearly 40% citing better value for money.” “People who believe it is cheaper to eat at restaurants than at home often live in food deserts,” said Matthew Baron, CEO of Wholesale Nuts and Dried Fruits. “In these areas, it could be cheaper to eat out than to shop for the ingredients that you want. Even Malibu, California, could be considered a food desert after the fires took out half of the houses and businesses. All the citizens left to live there have to drive to the next neighborhood of Santa Monica to find a supermarket to shop at.” Driving involves wear and tear on your car and money spent on gas. Public transportation and ride shares can be expensive, and grocery delivery isn’t always affordable. “If health is the goal, eat at home,” he said. “If you live in a food desert, then go out to restaurants.” Andrea Woroch, a budgeting expert, suggested taking advantage of lunch specials and happy hours, sticking to water instead of soda and alcohol (those are marked up), and splitting entrees. “Restaurant meals are usually larger than your home-cooked meals and more than you can eat,” she said. “Get in the habit of splitting a large entree with your partner or friend and see if you need more food, or add a small plate before to fill you up for less.” Marc Mezzacca, founder and savings expert at CouponFollow, said to not order fries, fried seafood or salads, because they don’t make good leftovers. “But you can stretch a restaurant meal if you play it right,” Carulli said. “Order something substantial — pastas, braised meats, grain bowls — and you’ve got built-in leftovers. That’s two meals for the price of one entrée, and you didn’t have to julienne a single thing.” “Stick with generics,” Woroch said. “This is a tried and true savings method that still applies and shouldn’t be ignored because it cuts your grocery bill by 30% on average. Compare ingredients side by side between the national name brand and store brand to see how they stack up and give it a go. Many stores will allow for returns if you’re not satisfied, so it’s worth a try.” She said food that’s about to expire will be discounted, too, up to 50%. “Just make sure to cook it right away or freeze it to avoid it going bad,” she said. Mezzacca recommended shopping at places like Costco and buying pantry staples like lentils and pasta in bulk. “Frozen fruits and vegetables are good as they are affordable, last longer and reduce waste,” Mezzacca said. “Cooking ahead of time and cooking in bulk minimizes spoilage and impulse buying. Sometimes, dining out can have a convenience and economic factor. But with groceries, there is more control over portion size, ingredients and long-term values.” If you’re single or in a couple or don’t have kids, it might make sense to eat out more. But if you have three kids like Deliciously Rushed food blogger Rose Sioson does, cooking at home is the way to go. “It’s definitely cheaper for us to buy groceries than eat out,” she said. “The trick is planning. Before I shop, I do a simple meal plan so we only buy what we’ll actually cook and eat. That way, we’re not throwing money or food away. Eating out can be fun, but for a big family, even splitting meals or bringing home leftovers adds up fast.” She spends 10-15 minutes a week planning meals based on what’s already in stock and then adds what she needs to a grocery list. She shops at Costco and recommends the rotisserie chicken and bulk items like rice. Based on her haul, she’ll plan theme nights like a stir-fry night or a taco night or leftovers night. And the freezer is your friend. “Use your freezer as your backup plan — freeze leftovers, extra bread, herbs or meats,” she said. “Prep meats ahead of time. I portion and cut them before freezing, so when it’s time to cook, I just thaw them in the fridge and they’re ready to go.” Food waste is a serious issue and a way to not get enough bang for your buck. “Don’t let half the cart go limp in the veggie drawer,” Carulli said. “Bulk buying helps, but only if you’re not bulk-wasting. And don’t get me started on herbs. You buy one $4 bundle, use three leaves and the rest disintegrates into compost.” To save money, he recommended shopping at farmers markets, and, like Sioson said, purchasing a rotisserie chicken. “Roast a chicken Sunday, use it in tacos Monday, soup Tuesday and a grain bowl Wednesday,” he said. “That’s one ingredient, four meals, zero waste.” For two decades, HuffPost has been fearless, unflinching, and relentless in pursuit of the truth.

Maybe spending a lot of money on one restaurant meal instead of groceries that would last for a week isn’t cost-effective. Despite the urge to eat out, people shouldn’t feel guilty about it. Carulli thinks people should allow themselves to eat out once in a while. “Cook when you’ve got the energy, eat out when you need the ease — or the entertainment,” he said. “If cooking dinner means stress, mess and a meltdown, give yourself permission to tap out. A $20 meal might be cheaper than therapy.” By entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.
