Title: I shopped at Ollie's Bargain Outlet for the first time and found lower prices than at Target and Walmart

When I mentioned that I planned to visit Ollie's Bargain Outlet for an article, several of my East Coast-based colleagues responded with some variation of "OMG I LOVE OLLIE'S." I'd never heard of Ollie's until the brand acquired 40 former Big Lots stores across the US in February, including four new locations in my home state of Wisconsin, but it appears to have cultivated a loyal following of bargain-hunters. Another indicator of the brand's staying power: as many brick-and-mortar stores downsize and struggle to stay afloat, Ollie's is one of the fastest-growing brands in the US in 2025, according to a Yelp report. Net sales grew 8% in the 2024 fiscal year to $2.27 billion, according to Ollie's latest earnings report. It also opened 50 new stores in the 2024 fiscal year, bringing its total to 559 stores in 31 states, and it plans to open 75 more locations by February 2026. President Donald Trump's "reciprocal" tariffs may also increase the popularity of discounted shopping locations, as consumers are expected to pay more for items such as groceries, electronics, and toys once they're implemented. I visited Ollie's to compare its prices to Target and Walmart and see if it lived up to its slogan of "Good stuff cheap." Take a look inside. All four new Ollie's locations in Wisconsin opened in February. There are no longer any Big Lots stores in Wisconsin after the brand closed 200 stores across 41 states in 2024. The carts appeared to contain mostly seasonal items such as summer-themed tumblers and beach towels for $2.99. It reminded me of the Bullseye's Playground section at Target containing items costing between $1 and $5. Ollie's, founded by Mark Butler, Mort Bernstein, Harry Coverman, and its namesake, Oliver "Ollie" Rosenberg, opened its first store in Pennsylvania in 1982. Its 100th store opened in 2011, and Ollie's became a publicly traded company in 2015. The walls at Ollie's were plastered with illustrated signs advertising the low prices in creative ways, such as "Caution: bargains ahead" with "Ollie" dressed as a construction worker, and "Knockout deals" showing the character wearing boxing gloves. Everywhere I turned, I saw another quirky sign that made me chuckle. Instead of selling the new releases and bestsellers I usually see at big-box chains, Ollie's stocked an eclectic collection of graphic novels, coffee table books, volumes of Bible studies, and picture books for kids. I thought the coffee table books in particular would make great inexpensive gifts. I found a giant book about baseball stadiums for $7.99 that the baseball enthusiasts in my life would love. In one of the grocery aisles filled with canned goods and condiments, many of the items were still in boxes. I recognized some brands, like Campbell's and Libby's, but others were new to me. Piles of boxes crowding a store can indicate understaffing and may deter customers from shopping if they have to squeeze through the aisles, Business Insider previously reported. Since most of the merchandise was shelved in cardboard boxes, this could have been more of a stylistic choice. I compared prices using the Target and Walmart apps on my phone while browsing the aisles at Ollie's. The same 8.9-ounce box of Cheerios costs $4.49 at Target and $3.68 at Walmart. A can costs $2.69 at Target. At Walmart, it was on sale for $2.48, which was still more expensive than Ollie's. That three-pack would cost $5.79 at Target and was listed for $12.80 on Walmart's website, though it's likely cheaper in-store. Ollie's keeps its prices low by buying closeout, irregular, discontinued, and overstock merchandise at a discount. The limited edition Dove body washes, which retailed for $4.99 at Ollie's, were no longer available at Target or Walmart. Other Dove body washes of the same size sell for $8.69 at Target and $7.97 at Walmart. A Black and Decker Crisp 'N Bake air fryer and toaster oven was priced at $39.99 at Ollie's, while a regular four-slice toaster oven cost $29.99. Target appeared to sell the same four-slice toaster oven for $29.99, matching Ollie's price, but it was difficult to compare prices for the air fryer since I didn't find exact matches on their websites. Perhaps the toaster-air fryer combination Ollie's had in stock was an older or discontinued model that is no longer sold in other locations. There were also new air conditioners for sale, like a 10,000 BTU window unit from Danby priced at $279.99. The exact design I saw no longer appears to be sold by Danby, though the company offers other units with the same cooling power for $429.99 and above. The raw flooring materials in the housewares section reminded me of Menard's, a Midwestern home-improvement chain frequented by contractors and DIYers and known for its mail-in rebate discounts. Laminate chestnut oak flooring cost 97 cents per square foot, while 5-foot by 7-foot Zephyr Collection rugs cost $99.99. Barbies ranged from $8.99 to $12.99 at Ollie's, which was less expensive than at other stores. For example, the "You Can Be Anything" teacher Barbie cost $8.99 at Ollie's compared to $14.99 at Target and $11.60 at Walmart. Toy prices are expected to increase due to Trump's 145% tariff on Chinese goods. Ollie's is a store with personality. The vibrant comic book-like signage and the treasure-hunting nature of sorting through the aisles made for an enjoyable outing. The prices were also lower than big-box competitors like Walmart and Target. I wouldn't necessarily shop at Ollie's if I needed a specific brand of cereal or shampoo since the inventory varies based on what discounted merchandise is available, but if I just need some "Good stuff cheap" once Trump's tariffs take effect, I'd definitely shop there again. When BI reached out to Walmart and Target about how their prices compare to Ollie's, a Walmart representative told BI: "At Walmart, we operate an every day low price model, in which we work to remove costs through efficiencies in our own operations and supply chain — to operate at an every day low cost (EDLC) so that we can in turn provide our customers with every low prices (EDLP). We constantly advocate for lower prices on behalf of our customers." Representatives for Target and Ollie's did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Jump to

Title: [Latest] U.S. Kids Beverage Market to Hit Valuation of US$ 30.24 Billion By 2033 | Astute Analytica

May 06, 2025 12:30 ET | Source: AstuteAnalytica India Pvt. Ltd. AstuteAnalytica India Pvt. Ltd. Chicago, May 06, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The U.S. kids beverage market is projected was valued at US$ 18.84 billion in 2024 and is expected to reach US$ 30.24 billion by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 5.53% during the forecast period 2025–2033. The United States kids beverage market has spent the past thirty-six months in a trial-and-error cycle that is rapidly reshaping category leadership. IRI panel data for 2024 show that 61% of households with children bought at least one “limited-time” flavor over the last year, up from 38% in 2021. Brands that capitalized early—Capri Sun with Strawberry Kiwi Splash, Gatorade Zero Kids with Glacier Freeze, and Honest Kids with Super Fruit Punch—saw unit velocities climb 9–14% even as shelf facings remained flat. Fruit blends now account for 42% of all juice-box UPCs, overtaking single-flavor apple offerings for the first time since records were kept. Within enhanced waters, blue raspberry and cotton-candy variants—once regarded as novelty items—have crossed the 5% share threshold, a milestone usually associated with sustained repeat purchases. Download Sample Pages: https://www.astuteanalytica.com/request-sample/united-states-kids-beverages-market Flavor churn is, however, only half the story; manufacturers are leveraging real-time social listening to identify micro-trends before they hit mainstream retail in the kids beverage market. PepsiCo’s Stingray dashboard, for example, flags elementary-school lunchbox mentions on TikTok every four hours, feeding that intel to R&D teams that can turn around pilot batches in under ten weeks. The payoff is visible: “Dragonfruit Burst” appeared in Walmart end-caps nationwide just 94 days after first trending online. At the same time, legacy players are pruning underperforming classics—Orange Tang was delisted by two major grocers in Q3-2023—to make room for Gen-Alpha-friendly mashups like mango-peach and watermelon-lime. Stakeholders should therefore view flavor leadership not as a static mantle but as a rolling sprint governed by data-backed agility and nimble co-packer partnerships. Key Findings in United States Kids Beverage Market Functional hydration products reshape wellness narratives for school-aged consumers today in the Kids Beverage Market Wellness claims have become table stakes, but functional hydration adds a science-backed edge that resonates with parents scanning ingredient lists. The 2024 Kids’ Beverage Attributes Survey from SPINS reveals that 47% of U.S. guardians now look for electrolytes, B-vitamins, or prebiotics when purchasing drinks for children aged six to twelve. Propelled by this interest, brands such as Prime Hydration Kids, BODYARMOR Flash I.V., and Pedialyte Sport Junior grew combined unit sales by 28% year over year. Notably, products with 100 mg or less sodium per serving doubled their shelf presence, underscoring a “clean-label electrolyte” narrative that appeals to pediatricians and school administrators striving to curb excess salt. Energy modulation is the second pillar driving functional launches in the United States kids beverage market. Caffeine remains off-limits for under-13s, so formulators are leaning on L-theanine, magnesium, and plant-derived adaptogens to support focus without jitters. DSM-Firmenich reports a 300% surge in requests for water-stable L-theanine emulsions suitable for 6-ounce pouches. Meanwhile, Nestlé’s Boost Kids Essentials fortified drink introduced 4 g of prebiotic fiber to address digestive health, and early ACV scanner data indicate a 12% repeat-purchase rate within eight weeks—an impressive signal for a premium-priced SKU. Parents, buoyed by pediatric health-influencer endorsements on Instagram, appear willing to pay a 35 ¢ per-unit premium if the beverage promises immunity or cognitive benefits validated by peer-reviewed studies. Decision makers should therefore embed clinical substantiation into marketing narratives and consider partnering with children’s hospitals for longitudinal trials, as evidence-based storytelling is rapidly becoming the currency of consumer trust in this evolving segment. Plant-based and dairy-alternative beverages gain traction among allergic children nationwide Food-allergy prevalence among U.S. minors now stands at 8%, according to the CDC’s 2024 summary, fueling demand for plant-based drinks that circumvent common allergens. Soy once dominated the conversation in the kids beverage market, yet Oatly’s 2023 nationwide placement of single-serve oat-milk cartons sparked a 92% velocity increase across K-5 cafeterias operated by Chartwells Schools. Almond and coconut lines remain niche in elementary settings due to tree-nut concerns, but pea-protein formulas—Ripple Kids, for example—have captured a 19% share within the shelf-stable “milk substitutes” aisle. Nutrient density, especially a 50-% higher calcium content versus skim dairy, is a key purchase driver cited by 63% of surveyed parents. Beyond nutritional parity, sustainability messaging bolsters category legitimacy in the kids beverage market. Life-cycle-assessment firm HowGood notes that oat-milk boxes yield 45% lower greenhouse-gas emissions than equivalent UHT cow’s-milk cartons—data now called out via QR codes on pack fronts. Retailers are responding: Kroger expanded its “Plant-Powered Kids” set from eight to twenty-four facings in 2024, while Target’s Good & Gather launched an organic chickpea-milk line at $3.99 per four-pack. Flavor remains critical; chocolate leads, but strawberry oat-milk earned an impressive 4.8-star rating on the Walmart Marketplace within three weeks of debut. As brands explore sunflower-seed bases and fermented rice options, clear allergen statements and school-compliance certification will determine acceptance, underscoring the necessity for rigorous cross-contact controls and transparent labeling strategies. Sugar reduction strategies influence consumer behavior and parental purchase criteria With pediatric obesity rates touching 19.7% in 2023 (CDC), the United States kids beverage market faces relentless scrutiny over added sugars. The FDA’s updated voluntary guidance encourages manufacturers to limit kids’ drinks to 6 g of total sugar per 8 oz serving, down from 10 g previously. Consequently, 72% of new UPCs launched in 2024 utilize high-intensity sweetener blends—stevia-allulose or monk-fruit-erythritol—to achieve a 35–50% caloric cut. Kraft Heinz’s Capri Sun Reformulation 3.0 removed 2.5 billion grams of sugar from U.S. circulation between 2020 and 2024, a stat widely cited in retailer sustainability scorecards. Consumer sentiment validates the shift in the kids beverage market: an Ipsos poll of 1,500 U.S. parents found that 58% are willing to switch brands if sugar grams exceed classroom guidelines, even when price parity does not exist. However, taste remains uncompromised territory; 41% of children aged eight to ten reported “off” aftertaste with first-generation stevia drinks, pushing brands toward next-gen Reb-M and fermented sweeteners that mimic sucrose perception curves. Shelf tags now carry traffic-light icons—green for <5 g, yellow for 5–7 g—implemented by Albertsons in 327 stores, nudging parents at point of sale. Looking forward, tooth-friendly certifications from the American Dental Association and on-pack glycemic-index scores could become differentiators, suggesting that cross-functional R&D teams must synchronize sensory science, regulatory affairs, and marketing to safeguard repeat purchase in an increasingly sugar-averse retail environment. Value-based pricing tiers evolve alongside private label and premium launches Inflationary pressure hit family grocery budgets hard in the kids beverage market, yet the kids beverage category proved resilient by stretching across multiple price ladders. NielsenIQ 52-week data to March 2024 show that unit volumes in the sub-$3 six-pack tier rose 5%, led by Walmart’s Great Value Fruit Punch and Dollar General’s Clover Valley Juice Drinks. Conversely, $1.99 “better-for-you” single-serve bottles—think GoodSport Kids Electrolyte Water—registered a 17% upswing, illustrating K-shaped growth where value and premium both flourish. Notably, private label moved beyond me-too offerings: H-E-B’s Splashers+ includes 30% real fruit and 100% daily vitamin C, competing head-to-head with branded options at a 20% discount. Premiumization thrives on experiential cues in the US kids beverage market. Recyclable aluminum stubby bottles priced at $2.49 each, pioneered by PathWater Kids, signal both quality and eco-values. Parents surveyed by Mintel assign a “social currency” rating of 7.8/10 to premium packs visible in lunchboxes, indicating willingness to trade up for perceived status. Dynamic pricing analytics used by Kroger Precision Marketing reveal that promotional elasticity is two-times higher in households with annual incomes above $120 k, encouraging personalized digital coupons rather than across-the-board discounts. Operators should therefore deploy granular shopper-affinity data: spotlight rock-bottom value packs in food-insecure ZIP codes while upselling functional glass-bottle SKUs through Instacart in affluent suburbs. This bifurcated approach guards margin integrity while preserving volume, a balancing act essential for decision makers aligning portfolio breadth with the diverse economic realities of 2024. Innovative packaging boosts convenience, safety, and recycling participation rates nationwide Packaging has evolved from mere container to value-adding feature in the United States kids beverage market. Tetra Pak’s 2024 School Edge report notes that 54% of administrators now require tethered caps to reduce litter—technology first scaled by Kool-Aid Bursts Reload. Breathing valve pouches, such as those used by Slammers Chill’n, cut choking risk and meet ASTM F963-17 toy safety standards, a specification now embedded in Walmart’s Supplier Playbook. In parallel, spouted pouches with 30% post-consumer recycled (PCR) content have surged 41% in distribution; they not only reduce pack weight by 70% versus PET but also appeal to eco-conscious Gen-Alpha who routinely learn about recycling in school curricula. Smart packaging amplifies consumer engagement in the kids beverage market. Yakult Kids rolled out NFC-enabled labels that deliver augmented-reality games teaching gut-health facts, driving 2.3 minutes of average dwell time per scan. Meanwhile, Boxed Water Is Better Kids prints QR codes linking to carbon-offset certificates, reinforcing transparency as a brand pillar. Operationally, flat-bottom pouch formats achieve 12% higher pallet density, cutting freight emissions and enabling cost savings passed along in the form of bundle promotions—three packs for $5, a hit at Costco. Looking ahead, compostable high-barrier films from Futamura and Mold-Tek’s in-mold label cups promise to marry shelf life with circularity. Packaging engineers should therefore collaborate early with recycling-stream stakeholders to ensure that novel substrates are recognized by U.S. material recovery facilities, safeguarding claims and avoiding greenwashing accusations that can erode parental trust.

Amazon reigns online with a 46% share of digital kids-drink dollars, but brand-owned sites are scaling: Hint Kids Water grew its subscription base 55% YOY, boasting a churn rate below 6%. Grocery curbside pickup also matters—Albertsons’ DriveUp & Go logged a 23% lift in multipack flavored waters, fueled by “buy again” one-tap algorithms that simplify replenishment for busy parents. Last-mile efficiency underlies profitability in the kids beverage market. C-store delivery via DoorDash and Gopuff accounted for 11% of single-serve juice unit sales during post-school “3 p.m. spike” windows, an untapped exposure point for trial. Cold-chain integrity tech, like Vericool’s plant-fiber insulation, maintains 34–38 °F for eight hours, expanding the viable radius for perishable smoothies. Retail media networks (RMNs) close the loop: Kroger’s DSP can target ads to households that previously bought toddler purées, then measure incremental basket lift within 48 hours—capability that convinced Danone to double RMN spend in 2024. For decision makers, marrying DTC margins with omnichannel scale demands SKU rationalization: offer flavor variety packs online where digital shelf is unlimited, yet focus brick-and-mortar slots on velocity leaders to avoid out-of-stock fines. Seamless inventory visibility, order-management systems, and in-app loyalty hooks will determine who captures the at-home convenience dollar in the next growth wave.
