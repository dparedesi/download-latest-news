Today's revolutions in mobile computing get all the glory, but the best desktop PCs endure. Whether for high-powered gaming, rendering complex 3D scenes, or crunching data-drenched spreadsheets, the best desktops still do it better. At PCMag, we've tested thousands of desktops since our beginnings in 1982, and our analysts and editors represent more than a century of experience in desktop testing and reviews. We use standardized methodologies to measure CPU and graphics performance against relevant comparison PCs and assess all models on design, usability, upgradability, connectivity, and more. Our reviews encompass business PCs and workstations, gaming PCs, all-in-ones, and even mini PCs. Our current pick for the best mainstream desktop PC for most people is the 2024 Dell XPS Desktop for its budget-to-high-end configurations and expansive, high-style case. Below, see the rest of our always-shifting recommendations, followed by a deep-dive buying guide on everything to factor into your desktop purchase. With the highly versatile XPS Desktop 8960 for 2024, Dell remains a top dog of desktops. Dell configured our review unit as a high-end tower with lots of graphics oomph, which ripped through just about every benchmark we put it through. With an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 Super graphics card inside, it's also ready to ramp up for game time. However, we also picked it for its versatility in configurations. Starting at just $800, this desktop shows impressive range in the kinds of customers it can serve. If you desire a high-end desktop for more than gaming, stop looking: The latest Dell XPS Desktop is here. Not only is it ready for just about any task you can throw its way, but Dell's XPS Desktop case also leaves room for a decent amount of upgrades and an ample port selection. It's also available in far more affordable configurations, opening this product up to aspirational upgraders who want to start small. What is the price of the Dell XPS Desktop 8960 in the UAE and Saudi Arabia? Acer has developed a bit of a value dynasty for itself, with the previous title holder's direct successor now atop our list as the best desktop for most people. The Acer Aspire TC-1780-UA92 takes what the 1760 model accomplished and levels it up with a 13th Gen Intel Core i5 processor inside paired with 8GB of memory and the same 512GB SSD capacity. With the Aspire TC-1780-UA92, Acer stands above every budget tower weâ€™ve tested since. Its sub-$600 starting price nets you plenty of power, space for upgrades, and modern amenities like a front USB-C port and card reader, Wi-Fi 6E connectivity, and dual HDMI ports for two monitors. Yet again, anyone seeking the best PC for their family or household with a tight budget will be served well by this Acer model. Its value-oriented array of components continues to be better than what we see from most budget PCs, and it includes features found in high-end machines not too long ago. Expect this Acer tower to be a reliable daily driver for years after purchase. What is the price of the Acer Aspire TC-1780-UA92 in the UAE and Saudi Arabia? MSI handily took the budget gaming rig crown with its Codex R2 model, a sub-$1,000 desktop with modern features, competent performance, and lots of room for expansion. The Codex nails all of the criteria we value in entry-level gaming PCs, particularly allowing you to invest in the product down the line with upgrades to core components like the CPU and GPU in addition to memory and storage. It's also competitively priced for the hardware it houses, able to serve up 1440p performance for less than a grand. Budget-bound PC gamers who don't want to sacrifice performance and get more out of their new gaming desktop than their 1080p or 4K console setup can muster should seriously consider the MSI Codex R2. This is one of the most affordable entries into 1440p gaming that we've seen, making it an instant recommendation for frugal buyers. What is the price of the MSI Codex R2 in the UAE and Saudi Arabia? Known primarily for its high-performance components and gaming PC cases, Corsair's years-old foray into complete systems has resulted in one of the best PCs we've seen for compact gaming. Don't be fooled by this diminutive desktop's dashing wood-paneled design: The Corsair One i500 packs an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 GPU that topped our benchmark charts, thanks in no small part to its high-efficiency, liquid-cooled parts inside. Plus, the One i500's components are all upgradable despite its small frame, even the GPU, though you'll need to mail in the tower for that. To get so much power out of such a space-friendly design, we think that once-a-generation process is worth it when the RTX 4090 eventually gets surpassed. Anyone looking for the best desktop for compact gaming and having the cash to make their dream come true should consider the Corsair One i500 before looking further. If you don't like the wood paneling, Corsair sells a metal-paneled version to match your aesthetic. Also, despite this PC clearing $3,000, you might be shocked to learn it's better-priced than most gaming rigs housing an RTX 4090. What is the price of the Corsair One i500 in the UAE and Saudi Arabia? Skipping the M3 generation of processors proved well worth it for Apple's miniature Mac. The latest Mac mini takes on Apple's M4 processors to incredible effect, particularly in the M4 Pro we tested for our review. The M4 Pro Mac mini blew away like-configured mini desktops and challenged workstations several times its size in some tests. This is before even getting to Apple's redesign, which introduced more ports and better cooling. Whether at its starting budget-priced configuration or tricked out to get serious work done, the new Mac mini is a no-brainer. What's so impressive about the new Mac mini is its ability to serve widely different audiences. It's one of the best budget desktops, starting at just $599 with the M4 chip, 16GB of memory, and a 256GB SSD. At $1,399, it becomes a pint-size M4 Pro powerhouse ready to compete with legitimate workstations. You don't see that kind of value versatility in most desktops. What is the price of the Apple Mac Mini M4 in the UAE and Saudi Arabia? Versatility is king when recommending a PC to all sorts of general users, and it doesn't get much more adaptable in the desktop space than the HP Envy Move. This all-in-one is designed to move around the home, with a lightweight design that includes a handle and self-deploying feet. It can be used in any room as needed with relative ease, thanks to the included keyboard with a built-in touchpad, and even an internal battery for a few hours off the charger. The Move includes a capable 13th Gen Intel processor, a bright 23.8-inch 1440p display, and a decent webcam, so as to not diminish its capacity as a normal desktop. The reasonable pricing helps, too. If you're a casual, everyday user looking for an all-in-one desktop, you should be happy with this one. For those of you who may not make extensive use of the mobility, we'd still recommend it as an effective general-use AIO. For those who may want to move it around the house or office, it's painless to do so, and various family members can enjoy it for a range of tasks. Just note that the performance doesn't hit the higher end of some more potent AIOs, if that's what you need. What is the price of the HP Envy Move in the UAE and Saudi Arabia? You won't find a huge swath of business-focused AIOs, but HP's EliteOne 870 G9 is the best in class right now. Its sharp professional design and quiet operation are an ideal fit for an office, while its excellent performance and clear webcam can produce what you need to work effectively. Its speakers are loud, and the base stand features wireless charging, as a bonus. A hearty collection of ports rounds out this well-balanced machine. AIOs are not always the most cost-effective solution versus more traditional PCs, so from that perspective, you may consider towers and standalone monitors for fleet deployment. You can service the tower separately from the monitor, should one go bad, while everything is tied together here. If this design still makes more sense for your business, though, the included 1080p webcam is a big plus for home or office workers, as is the support for Windows Hello logins. What is the price of the HP EliteOne 870 G9 in the UAE and Saudi Arabia? Asus' NUC 14 Pro is the best current mini PC overall, carrying Intel's NUC torch into the future. This mighty little puck is ready for desks at home or in the office, with specific models featuring an Intel Core Ultra chip with vPro security for added peace of mind. With a comprehensive set of options for connectivity and upgradability, not to mention mounting hardware for stowing behind a monitor, this NUC revival is the most impressive mini PC we've reviewed in some time. This next NUC fits for anyone looking to fill a home office or cubicle with a tiny but punchy PC that can drive through basic productivity work. If you're seeking a PC that can disappear easily into a desk setup and accept upgrades to maximize its effective life, seriously consider the Asus NUC 14 Pro. What is the price of the Asus NUC 14 Pro in the UAE and Saudi Arabia? While we tested it at a much more potent configuration, Dell's Precision 3680 starts at a much more approachable price. This is an incredibly scalable workstation since its case needs to accommodate all of those possible levels of performance, and it features options for error-correcting-code (ECC) memory, which is essential for work in industrial control applications, critical databases, and infrastructural memory caches where data errors can be much more dire. What makes the Precision 3680 so easy to recommend is that it's applicable to many tiers of professional computing work, from an entry-level workstation to a top-tier tower of power ready to churn intense rendering and AI workloads. This desktop's effectiveness and value depend significantly on how you configure it for your computing needs before checkout, which puts a lot of power in your hands. What is the price of the Dell Precision 3680 in the UAE and Saudi Arabia? This is one of the most potent mini desktop workstations we've tested, with impressive performance from a 3.9-liter chassis. Lenovo's ThinkStation P3 Ultra SFF got on this list by achieving the diminutive size we look for from mini PCs without compromising too much on speed. Given the desktop's small size, we also appreciate the antenna-free Wi-Fi and Bluetooth radios. This desktop also starts at less than $1,000 and can scale up far past what our review configuration providesâ€”a major plus. Lenovo's ThinkStation P3 Ultra SFF is another highly scalable workstation, though it's a much tighter affair inside. You could upgrade this desktop for at least another generation. ECC memory helps future-proof the system and makes it capable of working in industries with zero tolerance for data corruption. What is the price of the Lenovo ThinkStation P3 Ultra SFF in the UAE and Saudi Arabia? To help you make the best decision in your search for the best desktop, we've gathered a list of the most frequently asked questions surrounding the topic, as well as a few more unsolicited but helpful facts to inform your choice. Below that, you'll find a condensed list of the above recommendations for easier spec comparisons. We've reviewed an impressive variety of the best desktops above, right? We don't deny that a laptop or tablet is a better pick for people who depend on business travel or whose computing consists mostly of basic surfing and typing from the living-room couch. But desktops are often the best choice and the best value for small offices, families, creative pros, gamers, and tech tinkerers. While the best desktops don't come in as many distinct form factors as laptops, you'll find lots of variation in computing power and room for upgrades and expansion. The key is to spend as little as possible to get exactly what you want or need out of your next desktop computer, whether that's a suitable budget buy or a high-power PC with a price tag to match. Reliability is a nebulous concept when it comes to computers: It could mean consistency of performance, or it could also mean the strength and support of its warranty, just to name two interpretations. Certain brands have developed reputations for reliability, namely computer makers like Apple, Dell, HP, and Lenovo. But no single brand can lay a blanket claim to any such title. Since that might not be the most satisfying answer to such a question, we also have our Readersâ€™ Choice coverage of the desktops category, which polls readers like you to determine widely held opinions on the various desktop options out there. Once you have winnowed down models based on other, more solid criteria, the wisdom of the crowd might help you develop an idea of the most reliable brands to count on in your search for the best PC for you. One of the best desktops' most alluring promises is the value they deliver. With desktop PCs and their components, your money simply goes further. Instead of buying a $700 laptop with a competent Intel Core i5 or Ultra 5 processor, you can get a $700 desktop with a more powerful Core i7 or Ultra 7 CPU and maybe even a dedicated graphics card. You can find complete mini PCs for super light work and display-signage tasks for less than $400 and perfectly serviceable small towers for $300 to $600. Gaming desktops with dedicated graphics cards start at around $700. You can also find all-in-one desktops, with the display and all of the computing components built into a single device, starting at around $400. The thing with desktops is that opting for a cheap one does not carry some of the same risks you'd face with a like-priced laptop. A $250 Black Friday special or a steeply discounted refurbished desktop could perform just fine for basic computing, and you wouldn't need to worry about the wear and tear on cheap materials that you might with a laptop of a similar price. That inexpensive laptop would be subject to the vagaries of daily commuting and the occasional drop from a coffee table. The desktop, in contrast, would need to stay put and just work. At the top end of the market are business workstations, tricked-out gaming rigs, and magnificently engineered all-in-one PCs that cost several thousand dollars. Not only will a $3,000 gaming tower provide immense computing power today, but it should come with so much room for expansion and potential for upgradability that its useful life will be far longer than any laptop. And that's before you even delve into the wild world of custom PCs: automotive-grade paint jobs, liquid cooling, and fanciful lighting and wiring. IT-manageable, security-conscious business desktopsâ€”most of them nowadays made by Dell, HP, and Lenovoâ€”have their own pricing dynamic and tend to cost more, all else being equal. That's because of their premium warranty or support plans, as well as the possible addition of enterprise-specific silicon focused on manageability or security. Sometimes, part of the cost premium of business desktops reflects the PC makerâ€™s guarantee that it will stock replacement components and upgrades for that line of machines for a fixed future period. That allows IT pros to count on the ability to continue servicing a fleet of a given business machine over that period. The Mac versus PC debate is one of the oldest in modern technology, and we're not going to pick a side or try to settle that particular religious war here. But if you're not wedded to one or the other by years of habit (or the peripherals and software you own) and are open to switching, here's a quick rundown of your choices. Windows 11 is the latest iteration of Microsoft's operating system. Most people typically rely on desktops that use it and previous versions of the OS, so you'll be assured of the best compatibility and the widest selection of third-party software. Desktops running Windows are also readily available below $500, making them attractive to casual users, families looking for a second PC, and bargain hunters. Macs are an excellent choice if you're already in an Apple-centric household since macOS is seamlessly compatible with iPads and iPhones. You can also send and receive messages on any device connected to your iCloud account. However, the cost of entry will be higher than with the least expensive PCs. Google's ChromeOS is a viable alternative to Windows and macOS, but desktops running it (called Chromeboxes) are rare and best suited to niche uses like powering a restaurant menu display. A fourth option is to buy a desktop with no operating system at all and install an open-source one of your choosing, such as Ubuntu Linux. We don't recommend going this route unless you're technically savvy, willing to experiment, and OK with fixing software compatibility issues and other quirks. Macs and Windows PCs are available in all three of the major desktop form factors: mini PCs that can fit on a bookshelf, sleek all-in-ones with built-in (and usually high-resolution) displays, and traditional desktop towers that are bulky but have room for more expansion. These three forms each have strengths and weaknesses, and none of them is an obvious best choice for everyone. You'll have to choose based on what you plan to do with your desktop and where you plan to put it. For truly cramped quarters, light workloads, and people who love the efficient use of space, a mini PC could be the best choice. They come in sizes ranging from tiny sticks not much larger than a USB thumb drive to small-form-factor (SFF) towers that may be nearly a foot tall but have compact footprints. The smallest sizes have the benefit of disappearing behind an HDMI-equipped monitor or TV, and they contain a processor, memory, storage, and ports to hook up keyboards and mice. They're economical and power-efficient, and they can serve as adequate web browsing or multimedia viewing platforms. But know that the models at the truly tiny end of the scale have no room for adding extra internal components, and their preinstalled parts are usually difficult or impossible to upgrade. Regardless, you can find a fair mix of what qualifies as mini PCs that can be customized or upgraded with better components. They're bigger than the "stick"-style PCs but much more flexible and expandable. Traditional tower desktops are capable of even more flexibility but also bring a lot more bulk. Nowadays, the differences between midsize and full-size towers are less well-defined, and some of the new PC case designsâ€”from cubes to glass boxesâ€”defy easy categorization. Still, nearly all desktop towers have generous amounts of interior space and full-size (a.k.a. ATX) motherboards, so you can install one or more (sometimes, many more) secondary storage drives, more RAM in empty slots on the motherboard, a video card if one isn't installed, and in some remote cases, even a second graphics card for extreme gaming or graphics-accelerated tasks. (Note that not all desktop mini towers and towers can take a graphics upgrade. That is where reviews come in.) An all-in-one (AIO) desktop is quite a different animal from both of these form factors. An AIO can save you some space since the display is built in. An AIO's value proposition comes down to space saving and whether you are shopping for a desktop display simultaneously. Though you can find budget AIOs with basic feature sets, lower resolutions, and non-touch screens, many new models include touch-enabled screens, and some AIO panels have exceptionally high native resolutions of 4K (3,840 by 2,160 pixels) or even 5K (5,120 by 2,880 pixels). Touch displays make them excellent choices for watching movies or serving as a multimedia hub in the kitchen or other public areas of your home, though the absolute highest resolutions target content creators rather than consumers. With a few exceptions for business-oriented models, you will give up a lot of room for expansion in an AIO versus a traditional desktop tower. Cracking open an AIO for an upgrade or fix, while not impossible, is a bigger deal than opening the side of a desktop tower. Apple's recent iMacs are particularly difficult to open. One of the main benefits of a desktop tower is that it will use a desktop-grade CPU. That may sound obvious, but it's a key distinction. AMD and Intel, the two biggest makers of PC processors, provide desktop-class and laptop-class chips to system manufacturers, but often, the CPU model names are similar and tricky to tell apart. For example, you will see Intel's Core i7 in laptops and desktops, but having a "true" desktop CPU versus one made for a mobile device makes a big performance difference. A desktop CPU gives you more power for complex content-creation work, PC gaming, or math and scientific projects. Faster processors with four, six, eight, or even as many as 18 cores will benefit software written to take advantage of the extra cores. The desktop version of a given CPU will consume more power and generate more heat than versions designed for laptops, which must be incorporated into environments that have less thermal and power-delivery leeway. A desktop CPU also has greater wiggle room to incorporate a key feature, multithreading, that allows each of the CPU's cores to address two processing threads at a time instead of just one. When engaged with suitably equipped software, multithreading (which Intel calls "Hyper-Threading") can deliver a major performance boost. The best desktop chips may require liquid cooling systems, limiting their use to high-end towers with lots of interior space. Processors in these families are specialized and expensive, and youâ€™ll only want them if you have specific software needs that you know, explicitly, can leverage their higher base and peak clock rates, as well as all of their addressable cores and threads. These are not casual purchases. Conversely, many AIOs and mini PCs use the same efficient, cooler-running types of CPUs that you'll find in laptops. Intel typically labels these mobile-first chip designs with a CPU name containing "U" or "H," whereas most desktop chips instead have a "T" or a "K" or just a zero at the end. A mobile CPU might have the same number of processor cores as its desktop counterpart (four- and six-core chips are common in both), but its maximum power consumption will often be far lower. Also, the typical base and boost clock speeds may be lower, and the chip may not support multithreading. Regardless, many desktop PC buyers will be fine with these lower-powered CPUs for everyday work and a little more. For a typical tower using a true desktop-grade CPU, mainstream users should look for an Intel Core i5 or AMD Ryzen 5; the Core i7 and Ryzen 7 are also excellent, powerful choices, but overkill for most folks who arenâ€™t serious PC gamers, intense multitaskers, or prosumer video or image manipulators. If CPU power is critically important, though, these should suffice. The Core i9, Ryzen 9, Ryzen Threadripper, and Core X-Series are worthwhile only if you know too few cores or threads are holding back your workflow, or you have extreme needs in terms of internal storage (for which the Threadripper and Core X can help with internal resources). Again, see our deep dive on desktop CPUs to understand the nuances of these higher-end choices. Look out for Intel "Arrow Lake" Core Ultra processors to start hitting desktops soon after their launch in late 2024. These are the first Intel desktop chips with neural processing units for dedicating AI crunching. All computers have a CPU, but most laptops and many cheaper desktops don't have a dedicated graphics processor or GPU. Instead, their display output comes from a portion of the CPU, a slice of silicon known as an integrated graphics processor (IGP). An IGP is fine for basic tasks, such as checking your email, browsing the web, or even streaming videos. Doing productivity work on an IGP is completely within bounds. Indeed, most business desktops rely on IGPs. In any case, an IGP is not the answer for anyone who wants to run intensive 3D games, render architectural simulations, or perhaps train an artificial intelligence algorithm. These situationsâ€”especially games, but often pro-grade apps, tooâ€”can benefit from more muscular graphics. Times like these call for a graphics card, which will bring its own GPU to the game, and the most powerful of these are found in the best PCs for gaming. Choosing a graphics card is a complex affair. Gamers should consider the capabilities of their monitor first. A 4K monitor or one with a high refresh rate (144Hz or greater) will require a profoundly powerful GPU (or occasionally even two GPUs) to display games at the monitor's maximum potential. If you're just looking to do some middle-of-the-road gaming on a 1080p monitor (and not looking to win any professional esports crowns), a mainstream card will do just fine. Meanwhile, creative professionals and other power users should consider the graphics-acceleration recommendations of the apps they plan to run, using the software maker's system requirements as a guide. Graphics-accelerated video rendering or AI programs can benefit from the same types of GPUs as intensive 3D games. Professionals eyeing workstations will want to consider Nvidia's RTX A series lineup or AMD's Radeon Pro models. Check out our deep-dive guide to graphics cards for much more on the nuances of today's video cards. While powerful CPUs and GPUs are mostly relegated to desktop towers, nearly every desktop form factor can handle copious amounts of storage and memory. This is thanks to the advent of higher-capacity memory modules, especially solid-state drives (SSDs). The latter take up vastly less space than the spinning hard drives of old. It's still possible to find desktops with only spinning hard drives, but we recommend avoiding these and choosing an SSD as the main boot drive whenever possible. Some desktops feature a single-drive combination of an SSD and a hard drive. A "true" SSD is the only way to go as a boot drive today, though, considering how far prices have dropped in the last couple of years. A single 500GB or 512GB SSD is fine for most users. A 250GB or 256GB SSD is also a common size for a boot drive these days, but it's a little tight if you store much locally. Anyone with large media and game collections will want to consider several terabytes of storage across multiple drives. Consider choosing a fast SSD as the boot drive and one or more large-capacity but slower hard drives for bulk storage of capacity-sapping video or games. A typical configuration in this case is one 512GB SSD and one or more hard drives with at least 1TB of space on each. Such a setup can be more affordable than you might thinkâ€”an SSD plus one hard drive is sometimes seen on under-$1,000 desktop towers. If you think you'll add storage later, consider how many expansion bays your desktop has. A combination of two or more 2.5-inch or 3.5-inch bays should be enough, as these can accommodate any type of traditional SSD or hard drive. You'll also want to ensure your desktop has at least one M.2 slot to accept a PCI Express SSD as the main boot drive since that will enable the fastest throughput speeds. The boot drive will come as an M.2 drive in most new systems. These drives are quite small, the size and thickness of a stick of gum. While a desktop's SSD stores your data, its system memory (or RAM) works with the CPU to run apps and helps define its capacity to multitask. Memory capacities of 8GB or 16GB are fine for most users, and these are the most common configurations on entry-level or midrange desktops of all forms and sizes. Few people will see much benefit from memory amounts above 16GB, but you'll find exceptions. Gaming PCs above the budget level should have at least 16GB of RAM, and 32GB is a prudent upgrade for esports hounds who want to play and simultaneously edit and stream in-game footage. Finally, assuming your professional software can address higher memory amounts, professional workstations should have at least 32GB of memory with error-correcting code (ECC) capabilities to keep everything running smoothly. In that case, you'll want to follow the software maker's guidance. You might be able to excuse a relative lack of input and output ports on a sleek AIO. The screen and speakers are built-in, and you'll likely use a wireless keyboard and mouse, anyway. But mini PCs and desktop towers need the right selection of ports. At a minimum, they'll have to connect to a display, speakers or headphones, and a power source. On all but the absolute tiniest mini PCs, you should look for at least three USB 3.0 (or higher) ports, at least one of which should be the newer, oval-shaped Type-C variety if you have any compatible peripherals that plug directly into that kind of port. Future-proofers will want to seek out USB4 or Thunderbolt 4 options, which both use the Type-C standard with increased speeds and bandwidth. Expect to see the even-faster Thunderbolt 5 standard pop up more in the future, as Apple's Macs have already adopted it in their desktops featuring M4 Pro or M4 Max chips. You'll also typically find an HDMI output (and perhaps another video output or two, such as DisplayPort or VGA), a 3.5mm audio jack, a connector for an external Wi-Fi antenna, and a receptacle for a physical lock. Note that some mini PCs use scaled-down "mini" versions of HDMI or DisplayPort, which require a different kind of input cable or a dongle. Make sure the machine's video outputs are compatible with your display and its cabling. Larger tower PCs will have many more ports, providing support for pretty much any peripheral you need to connect. Expect six or more USB ports, for starters. On larger towers, one or two of these should support Thunderbolt over USB-C. Also, a given: an Ethernet jack for wired networking and multiple DisplayPort and HDMI jacks on the dedicated GPU for connecting one or more external monitors. Note that a tower with a graphics card may also have video outputs that stem from the motherboard, but you should only use the video outputs on the GPU. Many towers will also have multiple audio ports, including possibly an optical output and ports for individual speaker channels in a surround-sound setup. Make sure that these match up with any gear you may have; the number of surround-sound jacks can vary depending on the PC and its motherboard. Note that Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity, while reliably present on even the cheapest laptops and many smaller desktops, is not a given on larger towers. High-end workstations and gaming desktops sometimes have a second Ethernet port for doubling network bandwidth or for always-connected redundancy, while business desktops sometimes include legacy connectors such as VGA video outputs, PS/2 peripheral ports, or serial ports. The throwback-style ports are included for people who still need to use them with older, specialized hardware such as point-of-sale scanners or industrial equipment. Of course, you can buy dongles and adapters for these special port needs, but the possibility of having them built in is a key benefit of choosing a desktop over a laptop. When evaluating a desktop, beyond looking at what ports are present, also evaluate where they are. Are they easily accessible? Towers tend to have a few commonly used ports on the top or front (usually a headphone jack and a few USB ports). Some AIOs, in contrast, have some of their key ports hidden behind the stand in hard-to-reach places. Some buying concerns, no less crucial than the ones above, apply only to certain types of desktops. For instance, deciding on a screen size and type is critical for AIO shoppers. A touch-enabled display with support for in-plane switching (IPS) to widen viewing angles is welcome for an AIO that serves as the family's calendar or photo album, but know that touch support is not currently available on Apple's iMacs. Give some deep thought to the screen resolution, whatever the panel size. A 4K or even 5K resolution makes for a breathtaking screen, especially one that's 27 inches or larger, but such resolutions often add significantly to the price. As a result, you may want to settle for a screen with a full HD or 1080p (1,920-by-1,080-pixel) native resolution and spend money to upgrade other components instead. Also, look for multiple cameras, one facing the rear, that could make an AIO a smart choice, say, for an ID-card printing station. Fan noise is also a consideration with AIO since their computing components will be on your desk instead of hidden underneath it. The best desktop towers have many idiosyncrasies. Enthusiasts who like to tinker with components but aren't interested in building their own best PCs from scratch will need to pay special attention to the number and type of expansion bays and how easily they can access power and data cables. They should also check the maximum wattage rating of the power supply unit (PSU) and whether the case has the clearance for bigger coolers (or the mounting points for liquid cooling gear) if they plan to add a more powerful CPU later on. A low-wattage PSU, such as a 300-watt model used in a desktop with integrated graphics, might preclude adding a graphics card later on without upgrading the PSU, too. Note also that some ultra-budget desktop PCs use low-wattage, custom-design PSUs that can't support a graphics card and also aren't easy to upgrade due to their use of nonstandard connectors on the motherboard side. Again, this is where a careful reading of reviews comes in. Desktop towers and mini PCs also require separate speakers or headphones to deliver audio. If you donâ€™t already have them, you'll have to spend extra money to buy some, and in the case of dedicated speakers, they'll take up room on your desk. For people who don't care as much about audio quality and just want loud enough audio to hear family members on the other end of a Skype call, the built-in speakers of an AIO should work just fine. There is no single best time to buy for most people in the market for an inexpensive desktop tower. While traditional sale holidays such as Black Friday can net you the odd bargain, when you find a system whose features, price, and performance match what you're looking for, take it home. However, people who need copious amounts of CPU or GPU muscle (and who have a clear idea of what hardware moves the performance needle with the apps they use) should pay attention to PC-component release cycles. Traditionally, Intel has announced new desktop CPU generations once a year, with the new chips showing up in PCs in the fall or early in the holiday shopping period. (This has shown more variance in recent years.) New graphics card releases are less frequent and depend on the vagaries of technical advancesâ€”Nvidia's highly successful GeForce GTX 1000 series, for example, was the cutting edge for several years before the first GeForce RTX cards were announced. Keeping track of PC component release cycles helps you become aware of what's new before you buy and also what is going off-market. For shoppers seeking maximum value or on a tight budget, getting a desktop based on a discounted last-generation (but still powerful) CPU or GPU can be the way to go. Meanwhile, shoppers looking for an all-in-one PC should pay attention to Apple's announcements. Many other manufacturers copyâ€”and, sometimes, improve uponâ€”the field-leading designs of the Apple iMac. Since you wonâ€™t be lugging a desktop around nearly as much as you would a laptop, itâ€™s less important to handle the chassis and test-drive its build quality in the store before you bring it home. Still, if the desktop comes with peripherals included, it can be helpful to type a few lines and move the mouse around in the store. Setting eyes on an all-in-one desktop is more crucial than with a typical tower desktop or mini PC. The screen is an integral part of what you are buying, and eyes-on time matters, especially if youâ€™re not well-versed, say, in the differences between a 24-inch and 27-inch panel or a 1080p screen versus a 4K one. If you limit yourself only to the selection at your local electronics outlet, though, youâ€™ll miss out on many excellent desktops. Some configurations can be exclusive to a single reseller, such as Best Buy, Costco, or Walmart. Other merchants, such as Micro Center, frequently have in-store-only deals that aren't available anywhere online. This is where return policies come in handy. If you find the best desktop for you online but can't test drive it locally, a seller with a liberal return policy is your best friend. Just make sure you've got adequate time to return it if it doesn't work out. Most desktop makers provide one-year warranties on parts and labor, with extensions available for as many as five years at an additional charge. Before you pay to extend the warranty, though, check your credit card account benefits guideâ€”your issuer might cover mishaps for a short period after you buy a new product and possibly extend the manufacturer's warranty, too. (For example, many MasterCard accounts include a doubling of the standard warranty period, up to one year.) If your card issuer doesnâ€™t cover you and you plan on keeping your desktop for several years, look into the cost of added coverage. Some manufacturers and resellers offer a wide range of extended warranties; expect to spend $100 to $300 for one of these options. Our rule of thumb is that if a warranty costs more than 15% of the desktopâ€™s purchase price, you're better off spending the money on backup drives or services that minimize downtime and protect precious data that you can't replace. Many people considering desktops in the $200-to-$500 range should also consider a refurbished machine. In certain circumstances, they can be excellent values. Large corporations lease fleets of desktops for a few years at a time, after which third parties refurbish them and provide them for resale on eBay and via retailers such as Best Buy, Newegg, and TigerDirect. To find these systems, search or filter the product category pages for "off-lease" or refurbished systems. These refurbished PCs are often surprisingly cheap ($150 to $250 is common), and many are desktop towers, so they're easy to upgrade or service if a component goes south. They do come with drawbacks. Their components are usually several years behind the cutting edge, they may be in imperfect cosmetic condition (some refurbishers grade condition on an A-B-C scale), and different refurbishers can have varying levels of attention to detail. Still, refurbs can be a fine option if you're looking for a cheap desktop to stow in a cabinet or under a desk, used to check your email and calendar. Just be sure to buy from a seller with a reasonable return policy in case you get a dud. Armed with all of the knowledge and decision points above, you're almost ready to shop. The final consideration is how well a desktop PC performs. We review dozens of PCs every year, evaluating their features and testing their performance against peers in their respective categories. That way, you'll know which are best suited for gaming, which is our favorite general-purpose all-in-one, and which is the best if all you need is a small, powerful system you can get up and running quickly.

I've been a Costco executive member for about 17 years now, and I rely on the warehouse chain when buying groceries for my family of four. Our executive membership is a huge help for saving money. Although it costs more than a standard Costco membership, we get an annual 2% back on eligible purchases. For us, it pays for itself and then some every year. Here are Costco meal staples I buy for prepping dinner for myself, my husband, and our two teens. Prices may vary by location. My family prefers thighs to breasts as they're more flavorful, easier to cook, and often cheaper. So, we stock up on Kirkland Signature boneless, skinless thighs and freeze whatever we don't use right away. We often grill them, slather them in mayonnaise to make family-favorite Parmesan-crusted chicken, toss them into soups, or chop them up for stir-fries. At Costco, we head to the meat counter and ask the butcher if we can buy the 10-pound tube of ground beef. We prefer this over the smaller package trays on display in the meat section, mostly because of the price. On a recent trip, the tube cost $4.39 a pound â€” 10 cents cheaper a pound than the other packages of ground beef available. When I pack this for freezing, I squeeze portions straight from the tube into my vacuum-sealing bags, which is much easier than picking chunks out of the foam trays. We usually pick up a 24-ounce Earthbound Farms organic Caesar-salad kit for $9. It pairs nicely with grilled chicken or steak and a baguette for a light but pleasing dinner that requires little effort. On a good day, our kids prep the salad and my husband grills the meat we add to it. On movie nights, I make homemade pizza. I already prepare my own dough and sauce, so I want my cheese pre-shredded. I like using Kirkland Signature shredded mozzarella because it's dry enough not to bog down a pizza. I pick up the 5-pound twin pack and break the bags into pizza-night-sized portions that I freeze until I'm ready to use. Kirkland Signature spinach-and-cheese ravioli are handy when I want to toss together ravioli pomodoro in a flash. These are also good for ravioli "lasagna," where these replace typical noodles as a shortcut to save time and use fewer ingredients. I love Garofalo tricolor organic pasta and can sometimes get six 1-pound packages for $10 at Costco. The colors and shapes are fun, and the pasta is delicious. I use the noodles to make all sorts of dinners, from cacio e pepe to pasta Bolognese. I can get 60 Trident fish sticks for $15 at Costco, and they're super convenient when I don't feel like cooking a full meal. I pop these babies in the oven, then pair them with frozen fries, peas, and tartar sauce for fish and chips with little-to-no effort. We usually pick up a 2-pound bag of Kirkland Signature raw, tail-on shrimp for about $12. I like to pair the shrimp with fries and roasted vegetables for a low-effort meal. The kids usually mix up cocktail sauce to go with the shrimp, too. The Kirkland Signature Normandy vegetable mix is hard to beat at $11 for 5 Â½ pounds of broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots. If freezer space is low, I break up the large bag into smaller packages. Fortunately, frozen vegetables can be used in so many ways. I put them in soups and pasta primavera. I've also leaned into treating veggies like meat, so I toss them in olive oil and spice rubs and roast them as a side. Lotus Foods organic millet-and-brown-rice ramen noodles are one of my favorite gluten-free finds at Costco. We tried them after learning about my daughter's gluten allergy, and I like that the noodles have a texture our whole family enjoys. We make a lot of soup dishes in the winter and these noodles never disappoint, whether we're using them in khao soi or ramen. They're a great deal at Costco, too. We pay $9 for 30 ounces of noodles, which works out to 30 cents an ounce. At our local grocery store, these can cost $7 for a 10-ounce package â€” or 70 cents an ounce. My husband has fallen in love with quinoa, which works for me because I hate rice. This grain serves as a nice base for a lot of our meals that typically use the former. I buy the 4-Â½- pound bag of Kirkland Signature organic quinoa for $9. It lasts us a while and we've learned this is way cheaper than buying quinoa at our local grocery store.
