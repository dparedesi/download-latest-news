Fiserv, Inc. (FISV) has reported a robust performance in its third quarter of 2024, with significant increases in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) and revenue. The company announced adjusted EPS of $2.30, a 17% rise, and a 7% increase in adjusted revenue, reaching $4.9 billion. The adjusted operating margin improved to 40.2%, and organic revenue growth was a strong 15%. Fiserv's Merchant Solutions and Financial Solutions segments experienced substantial organic growth, contributing to a free cash flow of $1.9 billion for the quarter. Strategic developments, such as partnerships with DoorDash (NASDAQ:DASH) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT), and the growth of the Clover platform, have positioned the company for sustained growth. Fiserv raised its full-year organic revenue growth guidance to 16%-17% and adjusted EPS expectations to $8.73-$8.80. Fiserv's third-quarter results demonstrate a company on the rise, with strategic partnerships and innovative initiatives paving the way for future success. The company's management remains confident in their growth trajectory, supported by strong performance indicators and a clear vision for expansion, both domestically and internationally. As Fiserv continues to execute its strategy, the market will be watching closely to see how these plans unfold in the coming quarters. Fiserv's robust third-quarter performance is further underscored by key metrics and insights from InvestingPro. The company's market capitalization stands at an impressive $114.18 billion, reflecting its significant presence in the financial services industry. This aligns with the InvestingPro Tip that Fiserv is a "prominent player in the Financial Services industry." The company's revenue growth of 7.2% over the last twelve months, as reported by InvestingPro, is consistent with the 7% increase in adjusted revenue mentioned in the earnings report. This steady growth trajectory is complemented by a strong gross profit margin of 60.96%, indicating efficient cost management and pricing power. Fiserv's profitability is evident in its adjusted operating income of $5.387 billion and an operating income margin of 27.23% for the last twelve months. This robust profitability supports the InvestingPro Tip that the company has been "profitable over the last twelve months" and that "analysts predict the company will be profitable this year." The stock's performance has been particularly noteworthy, with InvestingPro data showing a one-year price total return of 72.38% and a year-to-date return of 49.78%. This exceptional performance is captured by the InvestingPro Tip highlighting the "high return over the last year" and that the stock is "trading near 52-week high," with the price at 98.98% of its 52-week high. While Fiserv's P/E ratio of 34.14 suggests it's "trading at a high earnings multiple," the PEG ratio of 0.72 indicates it may be undervalued relative to its growth prospects. This is further supported by the InvestingPro Tip that Fiserv is "trading at a low P/E ratio relative to near-term earnings growth." For investors seeking more comprehensive analysis, InvestingPro offers 12 additional tips for Fiserv, providing a deeper understanding of the company's financial health and market position. Operator: Welcome to the Fiserv Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session begins following the presentation.

As we share our third quarter results this morning, it is increasingly clear that our position at the intersection of merchant and financial solutions is a strategic advantage. Fiserv delivered another strong quarter, with adjusted earnings per share of $2.30, up 17%, driven by strong revenue growth and further operating margin expansion across our businesses. Adjusted revenue growth was 7% and adjusted operating margin rose 170 basis points to 40.2%. Organic revenue growth was 15%. Our free cash flow was $1.9 billion in the quarter and $3.3 billion year-to-date, and we returned $1.3 billion to shareholders via share repurchase. Businesses and financial institutions are increasingly interconnected, and Fiserv has a key role to play here given our unmatched set of assets across software, data, technology and, of course, scale and experience in moving money. Here are two examples in just the past month. First, we announced this morning with DoorDash, we began implementing a comprehensive embedded finance application poised to be a best-in-class solution for gig economy company. This solution enables DoorDash to offer its delivery contractors a full range of financial services. Within a single app, they can get instant access to wages and rewards, as well as deposit accounts, debit cards and more. Our real-time ledger capability from Finxact manages the transactions and was a key reason why Fiserv was chosen. A Fiserv banking client rounded out the solution as a requisite sponsor. Second, we completed a proof of concept with Walmart where we enabled a real-time Pay by Bank transaction at the point of sale over our proprietary NOW Network. A growing number of merchants are adding Pay by Bank capability to maximize choice for consumers and the emerging capacity for handling such payments in real time offers advantages for Fiserv, merchants and consumers. This capability will be more widely available next year via our NOW Network. Additionally, we teamed up with Walmart Business as a referral partner for Clover as a business management platform, helping Walmart fulfill its goal of helping small businesses and non-profits to better run their businesses. In a separate but related testament to our product strength and position as a partner of choice, today Inc. magazine named Clover to its 2024 Power Partners list, which recognizes the best B2B providers for SMBs. Let me share some of the many highlights of the quarter. It was another strong quarter of growth in the Merchant Solutions segment, with organic revenue up 24%. At Clover, revenue grew 28% and value-added services penetration reached 21%, up 1 percentage point from Q2. In Latin America, we expanded the friends and family Clover pilots in Brazil and Mexico as planned with a full-scale launch coming in December. In Asia Pacific, we went live with our first Clover pilot in Australia in September. We also enabled the Enterprise Commerce Control Center, which allows merchants to monitor and analyze their business and transaction performance across locations, regions and operating segments in a single view. In Financial Solutions, we posted another quarter of strong organic revenue growth at 6%. The build out of CashFlow Central was completed in September and we have our first client gearing up to implement the solution in the next few months. And we continue to migrate clients to Experience Digital, or XD, our new digital banking solution, as we integrate additional solutions into this unique digital ecosystem, including CashFlow Central, real-time payments, Clover and more. We expect to see a multiplying effect on the average revenue per XD user over time. It was another quarter of marquee wins that demonstrate the power of Fiserv's integrated and value-added offerings. We were chosen to provide merchant acceptance services for a major e-com marketplace and expanded our long-standing partnership with Costco (NASDAQ:COST) to launch a stored value digital wallet. The service enables new payment and reward redemption experiences whether the retailer's customers are shopping online or in the warehouse. We continue to sign other enterprise merchants onto our value-added solutions. Another long-time enterprise client, Exxon (NYSE:XOM), signed on for a data-as-a-service offering. This solution is used to extract insights from integrated vendor, payments, consumer loyalty and wallet data. And because it runs in a cloud, we can reduce implementation time from months to days. Also in Q3, Ahold Delhaize, a global retailer whose portfolio includes Stop & Shop in the U.S. selected Fiserv as the provider of Pay by Bank services. Alex Lee, a large privately owned operator of multiple food companies, chose our Smart Routing technology for debit cost efficiency. We accelerated our signings of financial institutions as merchant acquirer referral partners. These included banks of all sizes as well as credit unions. Golden 1 Credit Union and America First Credit Union were two of the larger signings in Q3. In our three regions, we continue to see strong client momentum. We expanded our partnership with Netto, a major grocery chain in Europe. We'll provide several value-added services, including dynamic currency conversion, customer cashback and encryption solutions, in addition to supplying thousands of new PIN pads to accelerate transaction speed across their 700 stores in Poland. In Asia Pac, Fiserv was chosen by foodpanda, a subsidiary of Delivery Hero and one of the world's leading local delivery companies, to provide payment services across multiple markets in Asia. This strategic partnership spans online, mobile and digital wallets, positioning Fiserv as foodpanda's primary acquirer in Singapore and Hong Kong, processing over $1 billion in annual spend. We launched Clover Sport at Bombonera in Argentina. This is one of the country's largest soccer stadiums and home to one of the top teams in the league. Clover's presence there can add to awareness in the region. To optimize the fan experience for fast and easy concession services, the stadium, through our ISV partner, chose the Clover platform to accept payments in three ways: through QR codes, self-service kiosks and mobile handheld devices. Moving to the Financial Solutions segments, four banks signed on for CashFlow Central in the past three months, including our first credit union for a total of 10 since we announced the initiative a year ago. AvidXchange will be using the CheckFree biller directory to support faster bill payment on its mid-market B2B exchange. In September, we won a competitive bid with Farm Credit Mid-America, a cooperative that reaches across six states. We'll be converting their loan portfolio to DNA and integrating several other value-added solutions. PNC signed up for our AI-enabled Advance Defense product for enhanced fraud detection in their card issuing business. Equitas Small Finance Bank was the latest India issuer to go live on our India processing hub, successfully launching a new retail and corporate card product with a full-stack offering, including loyalty, offers and real-time fraud management, as well as credit on UPI, India's real-time account-to-account payment system. And we continue to build our capability here as a market leader with seven of the 10 largest credit card issuers in India on our platform. In September, we hosted 3,000 Fiserv clients and prospects at our annual Client Conference forum. This group of attendees represent nearly 50% of our North American institutional revenue across the Merchant and Financial Solutions segments and nearly 60% of our new business pipeline through 2025. After three days of demos across 75 booths in our Experience Center, over 100 well-attended product and technology information sessions and thousands of client meetings, we strengthened our relationships and partnerships, expanded our pipeline of opportunities and generated enthusiasm for our offerings, setting the stage for continued strong growth in the future. One of the many highlights at Forum this year was our SMB bundle. The premise behind this suite of products is that small- and medium-sized businesses have a complex landscape to navigate for managing their businesses and they prefer a single easy-to-use system. With our own products and partnerships, Fiserv is the only financial technology expert with solutions that cut across the entire SMB value chain. Since the products and the clients for our SMB bundle span our Merchant and Financial Solutions segments, we have the unique opportunity to win business through the integration of solutions across both of our ecosystems. From our merchant ecosystem, we provide acceptance and processing, the Clover POS platform, Clover VAS, including vertical and horizontal business process software, capital, loyalty and gift solutions and the Small Business Index for localized insights. From our financial ecosystem, we provide CashFlow Central because cash management is a fundamental requirement for business success at SMBs. We also provide Optis for business card issuance, SpendTrack for expense management, Zelle for small business and core banking account management and digital banking. While we sell each of these separately now, next year, they will be integrated on our leading platforms. For FIs, the SMB bundle will integrate into digital banking environment such as Fiserv's Experience Digital or XD platform. For small businesses, the SMB bundle will integrate into the Clover Dashboard and be sold through all Clover channels. Lastly, I want to come back to something I said last quarter. Merchant-related services from Fiserv are back as an opportunity for financial institutions to compete and win. What's old is new again based on our innovations across the SMB bundle. It gives FIs a deeper view into an SMB's full financial position. With this knowledge and breadth of product, they can better grow and retain SMB clients and generate deposit and non-interest fees. We couple this capability with tools to help FIs readily find merchant customer leads and onboard them digitally. Showcasing our integrated SMB capabilities generated a lot of interest and ongoing engagement and we expect the SMB bundle to start contributing to growth next year. Turning to our guidance for the rest of the year, we are raising organic revenue growth from 15% to 17% to 16% to 17%, and raising our guidance for adjusted earnings per share to $8.73 to $8.80. As I look across all the new initiatives we are rolling out, I am pleased with how the vision and investment we put into motion five years ago has brought Fiserv to a strong position today, one that's clearly hard to replicate. The results show that we are executing on mandates for each of our two ecosystems, merchants and financial institutions. This will continue in many ways as we add to our Clover portfolio, extend services to enterprise merchants, expand issuing to new verticals and geographies, enable more real-time payments, modernize core banking systems, add partners, grow internationally, and continue to use distribution data and more. With this foundation of leadership and steady growth firmly established, we are moving to the next generation of solutions that answers the needs across both ecosystems. As the only provider serving both merchants and financial institutions with product breadth and technological scale we serve at the intersection between merchants and fintech, issuers and fintechs, acquiring and cash management, digital wallets and card services, spending and banking data, and many other combinations. This is not a vision. It is here today in our initiatives with DoorDash, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Walmart, U.S. Bank, Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) and others. Of course, these integrated opportunities are in their early stages. As excited as we are about them today, our measure of success will be strong sustainable growth for Fiserv over the medium and longer term. And now, I will turn it over to Bob for more detail on our financial performance. Bob Hau: Thank you, Frank, and good morning everyone. If you are following along on our slides, I will cover additional detail on total company and segment performance, starting with our financial metrics and trends on Slide 4. Third quarter, again, demonstrated our capability to maintain strong revenue growth and margin expansion. Third quarter total company adjusted revenue grew 7% to $4.9 billion and adjusted operating income grew 12% to $2 billion, resulting in adjusted operating margin of 40.2%, an increase of 170 basis points versus the prior year. Year-to-date, adjusted revenue grew 7% to $14.2 billion and adjusted operating income grew 12% to $5.4 billion, resulting in an adjusted operating margin of 38.2%, an increase of 170 basis points versus the prior year. Organic revenue grew 15% in the quarter, driven by strength in both segments. The transitory contribution from excess inflation in Argentina was 3 points to our total organic growth in the quarter, down from 5 points in Q2. As mentioned during last quarter's earnings call, dólar turista extended into Q3 and contributed less than 0.5 point of total company organic growth in the quarter. Third quarter adjusted earnings per share was $2.30 compared to $1.96 in the prior year, up 17% on the high end of our full year guidance provided last quarter of 15% to 17%. Year-to-date, our adjusted earnings per share increased 18% to $6.29 compared to $5.34 in the prior year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $1.9 billion, and year-to-date free cash flow was $3.3 billion. As mentioned in prior earnings calls, we expected free cash flow to be much higher in the second half of this year after a lighter first half due to the timing of cash flows for the green tax credit program. The related refund came through in the third quarter. Turning to performance by segment, starting on Slide 5, organic revenue growth in the Merchant Solutions segment was 24% in the quarter and 29% year-to-date. This includes a 6 point benefit from above-average inflation in Argentina in the quarter and a 10 point benefit year-to-date. While inflation remains high, interest rates in Argentina eased in late second quarter and are back to historical averages and, therefore, did not contribute to excess growth this quarter. The continuation of dólar turista contributed nearly 1 percentage point to Merchant organic revenue growth in the quarter and 3 points year-to-date. On Slide 6, we have again included a summary of the impact of excess Argentine inflation and interest on total Fiserv and Merchant segment revenue along with the offsetting headwind from currency devaluation, which impacts adjusted revenue. Adjusted revenue growth for Merchant Solutions was 9% in the quarter and 10% year-to-date. The quarterly results include a 15 percentage point currency headwind largely from the Argentine peso after a sharp devaluation in late December last year. Similar to Q2, the currency headwind to adjusted revenue growth was much higher than the inflation and interest tailwind in the quarter. 2024 has been an outstanding year for new Clover hardware launches. Earlier this year, we brought to market the Kitchen Display System, or KDS XL, to manage orders and improve efficiency in a 24-inches formfactor that larger restaurants demand. We also launched the Kiosk, which allows for self-service ordering, reducing wait times and increasing average tickets. In Q3, we introduced a new version of the Flex (NASDAQ:FLEX) handheld device called the Flex Pocket, which is 25% lighter, 50% thinner and oriented towards restaurant and waitstaff in retail. And most recently, we launched the Clover Compact, an entry-level solution that will help drive TAM expansion and create new VAS revenue opportunities. Now moving to the business lines. Small business organic and adjusted revenue growth in the quarter was 25% and 9%, respectively, on payment volume growth of 4%. This volume growth was similar to Q2 levels. According to a variety of external macro indicators, overall consumer spending growth is slower than last year, but appears stable at a comfortable pace. Fiserv's small business performance was ahead of our Small Business Index results, which showed year-over-year sales volume growth of 2.3% compared to 3.7% for Q2 and 2.8% for Q3 2023. The difference is likely attributable to our international presence and a slightly different mix of business. Fiserv is more heavily weighted to non-discretionary categories such as food and services, which have been growing faster. Clover revenue grew 28% in the third quarter on an annualized payment volume growth of 15%. VAS penetration increased sequentially by 1 point to 21% in Q3, driven by growth in Clover Capital and the Clover SaaS package. In Q4, we will be rolling out new vertical software plans for retail and services. With this progress, we remain on track to achieve our 2026 Clover targets of $4.5 billion in revenue and VAS penetration of 27%. Enterprise organic and adjusted revenue growth in the quarter was 37% and 17%, respectively, driven by transactions growth of 12% and higher VAS penetration. As with small business, organic growth in enterprise includes some transitory benefit in Argentina. Above-average growth in enterprise business reflects the ramping of a large PayFac from our processing customer to a direct client. Commerce Hub continues to see ongoing traction and is now processing almost 7 times the daily transactions versus Q1 and 2 times when compared to Q2. And clients are increasingly connected to enhanced solutions. Much of the Commerce Hub transaction growth comes from existing clients migrating to the Commerce Hub and the fact that they are now on the platform gives us the opportunity to sell more VAS going forward. Finally, processing organic revenue in the quarter declined by 1%, while adjusted revenue decreased 2%. This business represents the back-end processing we do for our bank and certain ISO partners where they own the merchant relationship. Year-to-date processing organic and adjusted revenue growth were both flat, consistent with our expectation. Adjusted operating income in the Merchant Solutions segment increased 19% to $931 million in the quarter, with adjusted operating margin up 290 basis points to 37.7%. Year-to-date, adjusted operating income increased 22% to $2.6 billion, with adjusted operating margin up 330 basis points to 36.2%. As noted in prior quarters, interest expense from anticipation revenue is recorded below the operating income line. If the interest costs from anticipation were included in the operating income, Merchant adjusted operating margins would have expanded 190 basis points for the quarter and 260 basis points year-to-date. Turning to Slide 7, on the Financial Solutions segment, organic revenue grew 6% in the quarter and year-to-date, in line with our full year outlook of 5% to 7%. Looking at the business lines, digital payments organic and adjusted revenue each grew by 5% in the quarter. Growth in Zelle transactions continue to be strong at 35%. We continue to see demand from clients for digital payments products such as FedNow and RTP integrations. CashFlow Central, our integrated AR/AP solution for SMBs, continues to see high interest from financial institutions. In the last three months, we signed two nearly-$10 billion institutions Amarillo National Bank and Tri Counties Bank. In total, we had four wins in the last three months, bringing the total to 10 since product announcement. In issuing, organic and adjusted revenue grew 7% and 4%, respectively, in the quarter, driven by demand across various verticals, including government and healthcare. During the quarter, we converted the remaining HealthEquity HSA and FSA card accounts to Optis, our issuing processing platform, solidifying our leadership in the healthcare card vertical. Banking organic and adjusted revenue grew 5% in the quarter. Last quarter, we spoke about signing a merchant agreement with Connecticut On-Line Computer Center, known as COCC, which is a client-owned provider of banking technology. In the third quarter, we expanded our relationship to include Experience Digital, or XD, which is our online and mobile banking solution. XD will now be available to the 150 community banks and credit unions on COCC solution. Third quarter adjusted operating income for the Financial Solutions segment was up 5% to $1.1 billion, and adjusted operating margin came in strong at 47.4%. Year-to-date, adjusted operating income for the segment was up 6% to $3.2 billion, with adjusted operating margin up 60 basis points to 45.8%. Now, let me wrap up with some remaining details on the financials. The corporate adjusted operating loss was $112 million in the quarter and $394 million year-to-date, in line with our expectations. The adjusted effective tax rate in the quarter was 18.8% and 19.0% year-to-date. We expect the full year rate to be slightly below 20%. Total debt outstanding was $25.3 billion on September 30. Our debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio went down from 2.8 times in the second quarter to 2.7 times in the third quarter, in line with our target leverage range. During the quarter, we repurchased 8 million shares for $1.3 billion, bringing our total cash return to shareholders for the last 12 months to $5.3 billion and over $16 billion since the 2019 merger. We had 24 million shares remaining authorized for repurchase at the end of the quarter. Turning to Slide 9, as Frank said earlier, we are raising our full year adjusted earnings per share outlook to a range of $8.73 to $8.80, up from $8.65 to $8.80. This is an acceleration in forecasted adjusted EPS growth to 16% to 17% from 15% to 17%. This is also a $0.04 raise at the midpoint from prior guidance and $0.14 from our original guidance. We are raising our 2024 organic revenue growth outlook from 15% to 17% to 16% to 17%. Additionally, we are raising our adjusted margin expansion outlook from more than 135 basis points to at least 150 basis points. Lastly, we are updating our free cash flow guidance from about $4.7 billion to above $4.7 billion, driven by the strong free cash flow in the third quarter and year-to-date. Given the current environment in Argentina, we continue to assume 4 points of benefit from excess inflation and interest this year for the total company and 9 points for Merchant Solutions. We now see the dólar turista program continuing into the fourth quarter, but easing through the end of the year. Our full year outlook of 16% to 17% total company organic growth includes a 4 point transitory benefit from inflation and interest in Argentina and just over 1 point of growth from dólar turista. Excluding these combined transitory factors, 2024 organic revenue growth would be 11% to 12% at the upper end of our medium-term guidance of 9% to 12%. The forecasted impact from foreign currency exchange remains 8.5% and we anticipate will continue to be a stronger though declining headwind to adjusted revenue growth relative to the tailwind from excess inflation and interest. Finally, in the past month, we made progress on three items that many of you have been asking about over the last month. While these do not have an outsized impact on our financials given the scale of our business, they demonstrate our ability to navigate ongoing change in our business in a way that is not disruptive and always open to opportunity. First, as previously reported, we expect Wells Fargo to take ownership of our 40% owned joint venture Wells Fargo Merchant Services on April 1, 2025, at which time, we will receive cash or assets for our portion of the business. Fiserv will continue to provide processing services to Wells' existing and new merchants along with other related services. As a result, we see no change to our medium-term outlook of 9% to 12% adjusted revenue growth and 15% to 17% adjusted EPS growth from this transaction. Secondly, we extended our merchant processing joint venture with PNC for the fifth time. The relationship dates back to 1996, supporting PNC small business and enterprise clients with hardware and processing services from Fiserv and we expect Clover to have a growing presence from here. And third, the State of Georgia approved our application for a merchant acquirer limited purpose bank charter. This approval from the state allows Fiserv to apply for direct acceptance into the card networks and is anticipated to be operational in 2025. This is a special purpose charter that enables optionality for sponsorship for merchant acquiring. It's important to clarify that Fiserv is not becoming a bank. Fiserv will not open branches, take deposits or write loans as traditional banks do. We have no intention in doing that and in fact the charter itself does not permit these traditional banking activities. With that, let me turn the call back to Frank for some closing remarks. Frank Bisignano: Thanks, Bob. I'd like to take a few minutes to discuss our corporate social responsibility initiatives, not because these are investment parameters, but because they represent who we are as a company. Hurricanes Helene and Milton were devastating for millions of people and businesses, including many Fiserv clients. Our response, as always, is to take action and we quickly sent support to the Red Cross and personally delivered supplies to the affected areas. As part of our partnership with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation and our investment to support its disaster preparedness and recovery effort for small businesses, we provided the Chamber with Fiserv Small Business Index data on the impact of the hurricanes. These granular insights on commerce levels leading up to, during and after these natural disasters are being used to educate policymakers and stakeholders, guide targeted response investments and inform philanthropic support efforts that create and boost small business recovery. Also in the quarter, Fiserv achieved a score of 100 on the Disability Equality Index and was recognized as a Top Veteran-Friendly Company by US Veterans Magazine, each for the third year in a row. The National Bankers Association, a trade organization that represents all minority depository institutions, presented Fiserv with its Corporate Excellence Award, making us the first large-scale tech provider to receive this honor. Finally, we continue to advance our sustainability and green building design strategy. Our Milwaukee headquarters recently achieved LEED Gold status following our Dublin, Ireland and New Jersey Innovation Centers, which achieved LEED Platinum status previously. These are just some examples of how our hard work and dedication show up in many quarters, but most importantly, it showed up in the strong financial performance you just heard. This put us at the top of the IDC FinTech Rankings for a second straight year, and our story today is about how we intend to stay there. I'd like to thank our more than 40,000 employees for their contributions to these significant achievements and for the day-to-day blocking and tackling that has produced consistently strong results. That's 40 years of building trust, scale and experience, and five years since the merger of achieving innovation through unmatched investment across our merchant and financial ecosystems. So, now, operator, please open the lines for questions. Operator: Thank you. We would now like to open the phone lines for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Tien-Tsin Huang: Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for the update here. I want to ask on enterprise. It did accelerate nicely more than the transaction growth that you put up there. So, I heard, Bob, you mentioned it was transitory part of it and then there was a PayFac conversion to a retail relationship, it sounds like. So, can you just maybe go through that and what's a good sustainable level as we think about the fourth quarter? Bob Hau: Yeah, Tien-Tsin, good morning. So, you're right, we did see an increase in transactions. Transaction growth in the quarter was up 12% over prior year. That actually matches what we saw in Q1. It's up from the 8% we saw in Q2. We definitely see some variation, particularly when we bring on new clients, some of them in this enterprise space can be quite large. And as I said in my prepared remarks, we did have a large PayFac begin to really ramp in the third quarter. We will see a little bit of that continue in fourth quarter as they get to full capability or full volume, and then it will return to "more normal levels." Overall for that business line, we obviously saw very good organic growth, well ahead of the overall company average on an adjusted basis, which again that has also impact from Argentina in it. We feel great about the year-to-date at 11% on an adjusted basis. Operator: Thank you. Next, we'll go to the line of Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Darrin Peller: Guys, thanks. And nice results. Can we just start with -- overall the business is showing really strong signs of cross-sell. And I know, Frank, you alluded to that in your prepared remarks and how you're really packaging together more and more between segments. Maybe just some very specific examples of where you see that shaping up? And then, just if you could reiterate your conviction around the Financial Solutions segment accelerating into '25. I think you said going to 6% to 8% from 5% to 7%. Just reiterate why and what the driving force is and what you're seeing? Thanks, guys. Frank Bisignano: So, I'd like to go back to something I'd like to say the construction of the company, right? I always believe that this was a very strategic set of assets we put together that were highly complementary five years ago. And one quick place to think about it is in merchant and FI, just in total, our ability to be the strategic partner of choice to deliver merchant and FI and put Clover on the front end of that. And then, really there is the power of owning a debit network and the ability of what to bring to our largest institutions and to our client base across merchants. And then, you go a step further and the future of the growth initiatives in terms of us talking about the SMB bundle and the ability to take all the assets we have and integrate them technically now, right? You see us on the front line there with Apple Pay and then you can see us with issuers in another spot and then see us weaving the place together and the ability of the crossroads of merchants and FIs, I think Walmart is a great example of it. I think DoorDash is a great example of it, right? And so, then you think about, okay, you got Finxact, you're bringing Finxact in as a [handless core] (ph) to be actually a ledger here for the famous Dashers. And then you go, okay, you put XD and Clover together and deliver a capability to every financial institution that runs on us. And you take a look at our international expansion and you look at the work on Commerce Hub, now showing up in the enterprise segment. So, I think the construction of the company with financial institutions all the way through from the largest to a credit union or a local community bank, and then you take on top of that the assets we bring to it. So, I mean, you're seeing it and then we brought 3,000 people to forum and I think you were there, too, if I am right. And I mean you saw the power of the franchise first-hand. So, we think that's why we see such sustainable growth for the long term, and we always think we can do our job better, too. Operator: Thank you. Next, we'll go to the line of Harshita Rawat from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Harshita Rawat: Hi, good morning. Frank, can you talk about STAR and Accel, especially given some of the changes happening in the U.S.? Maybe talk about their PINless capabilities [indiscernible] Signature capabilities, how STAR is positioned to grow? Thank you. Frank Bisignano: Yeah. So, I think one of the things to think about is we always believe that we wanted the capability to compete for transactions for our client benefit, right, for our client benefit. And that window opens up. STAR/Accel is clearly a strategic asset to sit at the crossroads of merchants and financial institutions. We believe our capability is strong on PIN. We have the signature capability. We do have dual-messaging capability. And we give our merchants and issuers choices to compete for transactions at every level. So, that's the strategy, right? The strategy is to support our client base. We believe it too is one of these steady opportunity you're not going to see this meteoric rise of transactions, but you'll continue to see volume share gains and we'll continue to have an asset in our repertoire to help both our merchants and our financial institutions. Operator: Thank you. Next, we'll go to the line of Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE:BAC). Please go ahead. Jason Kupferberg: Good morning, guys. Just a couple of questions on Clover. I know revenue growth was steady here, volume growth ticked down a little bit. Just any thoughts on Q4 expectations for those metrics? I think the volume comps get a little bit harder, revenue also next quarter. So, just wanted to get a sense of how we should be thinking about near-term trajectory there. I know you've got some new country launches, product launches to support it. Bob Hau: Yeah, Jason, good morning. So, yes, we continue to see good overall revenue and volume growth out of our Clover solution. As you know, we've got a target to be $4.5 billion by 2026. That gets us where we needed about the 28% compound growth rate to achieve that. It's exactly where we were for the quarter. It's where we are on a year-to-date basis. A key part of that is continuing to add value-added services that ticked up 1 point to 21% of revenue. Overall, volume remains good. It obviously isn't as strong as it was last year. Some of that is very strong last year. So, a little bit of a difficult comp, but also the consumer, while still strong, still spending, has certainly eased a bit. We saw that last quarter. We saw that continue again this quarter. But we feel good about where that spending is right now and what we see going into the future. Operator: Thank you. Next, we'll go to the line of Dave Koning from Baird. Please go ahead. Dave Koning: Yeah. Hey, guys. Thanks. Good job. I guess, my question, in the SMB segment, for many quarters, you had kind of teens growth, kind of 13% to 17%. This quarter was 9% despite Clover being in the high-20%s for many quarters in a row. So, maybe what -- kind of what's happening outside of Clover, and then how should we expect that to reaccelerate going forward, or maybe just kind of talk through that? Bob Hau: Yeah. So, there's a number of things going on. Obviously, Argentina tailwind has eased quite meaningfully since last year beginning of this year even where we saw in first quarter, 15% benefit to the Merchant segment, easing down in second quarter to 10%, now down to 6%. And that impacts both, actually all three of our segments, but certainly a good portion of SMB volume -- excuse me, SMB revenue. The other thing that does play out is anticipation has been quite strong and there is a mix differential between -- or benefit differential between SMB and enterprise. We've seen particular strength out of the large enterprises down in Argentina. We see that kind of shifting a bit into the next couple of quarters. A bit difficult to predict exactly what's going to happen into Argentina in the future. I think we've gotten it pretty right over the last several quarters and we see that excess or that tailwind continuing to ease. You may have noticed in our presentation and our charts, inflation continues to be a tailwind, although easing meaningfully, but interest has actually returned back to more normal or historic levels. And so that tailwind is subsiding quite meaningfully. And then, of course, if you get to an adjusted revenue basis, FX continues to be a real headwind for us in the quarter for the segments. For the Merchant segment, we saw 15 point impact -- negative impact to our adjusted revenue from FX. So, all of those play out in SMB, both in Clover and non-Clover. Operator: Thank you. Next, we'll go to the line of Tim Chiodo from UBS. Please go ahead. Tim Chiodo: Great. Thank you for taking the question. I also want to revisit the Financial Solutions revenue guidance for next year, which is set to slightly accelerate, so from 5% to 7% this year to 6% to 8% next year. When we think about the reasons, there appears to be a good long list of very clear bullets. So, there's the Target business, there's Desjardins, there's Verizon. I believe all of those are expected to go live with their incremental revenue streams next year. And then, of course, there's the CashFlow Central. So, I was hoping you could touch on or maybe elaborate on any of those particular projects and/or maybe just talk a little bit about the confidence that you have in that reacceleration for next year? Frank Bisignano: Yeah. So, I think, we were greatly reinforced only a couple of weeks ago at our Client Conference where you heard me talk about the added pipe, the added interest and the amount of opportunity we see to grow our client base. That was not unexpected. That was exactly what we expected for the outcome. Today, on a year-to-date basis, we're a 6% grower as we were in the quarter. I think when you think about the repertoire, Finxact is growing clients right now, and that will continue to add. You saw us talk about what we're doing with DoorDash, that's creating another fundamental, as I use in my simple language, bundle, which is embedded finance, right? Then, you look at this SMB bundle, which I am being deep in every other week reviews for over a year. So, my conviction on the depth of that pipeline will be bringing that online and will be within the numbers. We talk about merchant and FI, but -- and that merchant part shows up in the merchant P&L, but the reality is that also is bringing along other opportunity within the banking segment. And then, we do and we'll continue to have opportunities even within the banking segment outside the U.S. that we see more of than we did before because of the nature and the construct of this company. And you tapped on the items that -- you touched on the items that we're bringing in. I'd add one other one. We believe our long-term opportunity around AI and data for our financial institutions, what I said to medium-sized to smaller banks, we need to be their data and AI engine. And that's our natural position with them. Now, that's not in forecast today. We don't have a number in a box, but we have demand and we have the best data in the industry and data drives AI. So, I would think about it that the fact we're posting a 6% and we have these engines behind us has such conviction of what we could do. And we can do all of it better as I say every day just in the base business. So that's why we've been able to produce at the level we have -- even if you look at our five-year margin, look what we've done there, and I'm not saying we're going to have never-ending margin expansion, but I sure work on it regularly. Operator: Thank you. Next, we'll go to the line of Dan Dolev from Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead. Dan Dolev: Hey, guys. Great results again. Frank, Clover Go and Clover Compact, they look like great solutions from micro sellers. Can you maybe give us a little bit of an update on the strategy and in terms of initial traction that you see on these new products? Thank you. Frank Bisignano: Yeah. We also see those products as augmentation products for our client base, right? So, I just want you to think about that way we talk about our ability to expand TAM in our own client base by bringing more. We definitely see the Compact playing in the food space. Obviously, we're early, but you should also think about international, right, that we're going to be bringing those products outside the U.S. in many cases, where, yes, we will still have software and VAS on top of them, but they may be catering to a different market. And we're going to have different forms of channel distribution. So, it gets us more software coming down a little bit [scale] (ph) in terms of merchant, but also augmenting our current client base to have a product that can work a little more mobile for them at times, too. Operator: Thank you. Next, we'll go to the line of James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. James Faucette: Thank you so much. I wanted to follow-up on the SMB bundle and this ties a little bit into Dan's question, but it seems like there's a lot of capability expansion that's happening within the Clover ecosystem and then looking at new ways to go to market. How should we be thinking about -- I know you gave some targets for back book and some of those things to get to the $4.5 billion target, but how should we be thinking about like the roles that those will play and if there's been any change in your thinking in terms of mix or type of customers and such within that Clover target? Thank you. Frank Bisignano: Yeah. I know there's only one question allowed, but that's like five. Good job, James. Let me try it. Like first of all, in some ways, there's not really -- inside this company that there's a ton of new thought. We always have a lot of R&D going on that historically and the IR team don't always love me for it, but they're more apt to talk to you about when we're getting to market than what's in the R&D shop. So, this idea about us bringing more capability to the SMB space has always been there. I think if you go back to our acquisition of Ondot and us embedding it in Mobiliti and then it became let's think about XD and a new product, but then you start saying to yourself, we could deliver this way beyond Clover and XD, we can integrate it all, we can put out Spendlabs acquisition there. Oh boy, we could end up helping LFI's grow and other channel partners and future partners to be signed up. That's why we are ultimately a partner of choice for people who want to partner in the SMB space because of our capability. So, I think you got to think about it that, yes, there may be more back book swept up in there because there's a reason beyond switching out your FD150 for a Clover station, now you have a much broader capability. None of this back book, if it happened, was ever more than our natural kind of rate, which we talked about of merchant churn going from an older device to a newer. But I think you're seeing the size of the opportunity to actually impact Clover more than we might have because of the full capability set. Thank you. I think you're on the right track there. Operator: Thank you. And for our final question, we'll go to the line of Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. Please go ahead. Ramsey El-Assal: Hi, thanks for taking my question. On Clover international expansion, how long does it take to ramp a new country or region from the time you enter the market to when you reach peak run rate? And also, should we expect sort of a steady rhythm of new markets for a while here, or are you going to kind of -- should we expect some pauses where you build out and sort of spool up in the countries you've already launched in? Frank Bisignano: Yeah. So, I'm a funny guy. I think we're going to get to peak run rate never because we're just going to keep driving more. So, that's kind of the journey we're on. But if you want to pick a country like Brazil, right, I'll be down there on the kick-off of it in December for the launch in Brazil and Mexico. I remember us launching Argentina, call it, four years ago. So, first of all, it's the full build to get to market. As we launch it, we expect it in Brazil, perfect example, to capture more merchants and more revenue opportunities than we do today immediately. Now, our ability to scale at the peak, we have great partners. I think if you were sitting with our Head of Latin America, he would say Caixa is very motivated. Well, that's a huge distribution. Now, we're going to get them trained. They are doing that right now and ready to distribute. So, it affects growth rate in '25, but I see Brazil as a multiyear build and a multiyear ramp. Not because we weren't able to get to all the zip codes or towns, if you want to think about it, but adoption. And then, so it's a multiyear ramp. But much like CashFlow Central of Brazil is in next year's number at some level, nowhere near where it'll be three years from now. So, I'd like to thank everybody for your attention today. Please reach out to our IR team with any further questions. And have a great day, and thanks for your participation. Operator: Thank you all for participating in the Fiserv third quarter 2024 earnings conference call. That concludes today's call. Please disconnect at this time, and have a great rest of your day.

Title: Gold's Recent Record Run May Be Tempting—What to Know Before Investing

Gold prices have been climbing steadily, reaching a series of record highs as investors have piled in amid uncertainties that could affect other markets. While gold could add shine to your portfolio, advisors caution against going all in. In September, U.S. investors poured a net $1.91 billion into gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs), according to CFRA data. “It is important to note that while both gold commodity and equity ETFs flows have been negative overall in 2024, we have seen a turn in flows recently,” CFRA said in a recent research report. Meanwhile, gold bars have been flying off the virtual shelves at Costco Wholesale (COST) since last year. The company said gold and silver bullion was one of its top digital sales categories for the quarter that ended on Sept. 1. Gold is traditionally seen as a hedge or a safe haven asset when investors worry about stocks. And this year, so far, has offered a number of reasons for investors to be concerned—uncertainty around a U.S. recession, when the Federal Reserve would begin cutting rates, the presidential election and geopolitical risks. Through the close of trading Monday, gold prices are up 32% since the start of the year, trading at around $2,700 an ounce, whereas the S&P 500—a broad barometer of U.S. stock markets—has returned 23%. Anytime an asset sees that kind of growth, investor interest surges, said Brandon Angotti, VP, Financial Planning & Trust Officer at the Wealth Group Union Savings Bank. "You just want to make sure you're very careful, so that you're not buying at the peak when everyone else is sort of chasing [it]," he said. Financial advisors recommend some amount of gold in your portfolio for the sake of diversification, but there are some factors you should keep in mind before investing. Clients should hold no more than 5% to 10% of their portfolios in an alternative investment like gold for diversification, according to Angotti. He also urges investors to read the fine print on tax rates. Gold ETFs, for example, can be taxed at a long-term capital gains rate of up to 28% as opposed to a maximum of 20% tax for equity ETFs. On top of that, said MaryAnne Gucciardi, a certified financial planner (CFP) at Wealthmind Financial Planning, if you own physical gold in the form of bars or jewelry, there is a cost of holding it safely. That could mean additional insurance costs, as well as dealer premiums you have to pay when purchasing or selling gold, Scott Van Den Berg, President of Century Management, recommends his clients have gold exposure of 6%-7% via bullion rather than through a gold ETF or an ETF that invests in gold mining stocks, to hedge against rising prices in the future. “While inflation has come down, we don’t think it’s going to stay down,” he said, adding he believes elevated government spending will stoke inflation again, which could make gold more appealing. David Flores Wilson, a managing partner at Sincerus Advisory, however, cautions investors to not make the mistake of believing that gold has intrinsic value and will continue to have intrinsic value. “Investors should be mindful that there have been recent periods of over 10 years where gold's return has been nearly flat prior to its run-up over the last year," Flores Wilson said. Wealthmind's Gucciardi also believes it's difficult to ascertain where the price of gold might be headed, especially in the near term. "For short-term investors, gold often comes down to timing the market, which is tricky and not based on research-backed strategies,” she said.

Title: Here’s one economic message from the Costco gold bar craze

Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you find your favorite podcasts. It’s all about trust. The nation may have left the gold standard behind in 1933, but Costco (COST) shoppers have proven that gold is a red-hot buy. Sure, it’s an investment, but it’s also “reflecting this yearning for real money,” economist and senior fellow at the Independent Institute Judy Shelton told Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen below). “Gold is kind of a surrogate for the real economy, and it represents commodities but also that traditional role of money you can trust.” The wildly popular Costco bullion was introduced to warehouse club members last year via 24-karat 1 oz bars. The product has flown off the shelves, with Costco raking in a reported $200 million per month in gold bar sales. Demand has been so great that the retailer has begun to offer platinum bars. According to Shelton, the gold rush at Costco likely has personal meaning to the financially skittish consumer. Over the past few years, consumers have become accustomed to watching inflation spike as high as 9% while the US dollar lost 20% of its purchasing power. This hasn't exactly stoked Americans' confidence. Judy Shelton will be at Yahoo Finance's Invest conference in November. Register to attend here! The sudden rise in gold’s popularity could also relate to consumers’ overall trust in the precious metal and what it represents. “It’s a meaningful unit of account. It works across borders,” she said. “It has universal value, and it’s highly recognized.” Precious metals such as gold are currently having a solid ride. Year to date, gold prices are up 31.72% to $2,750 an ounce. Silver and platinum prices are up 41% and 3%, respectively. UBS chief investment officer of the Americas, Solita Marcelli, said the gold price rally has further room to run, citing the potential for more interest rate cuts and worsening geopolitical tensions. "Despite the rally, we think gold's hedging properties remain attractive. Alongside physical gold, investors may consider exposure through structured strategies, ETFs, or via gold miner equities. Investors unaccustomed to the volatility of individual commodities may also consider exposure via an actively managed strategy that seeks to deliver alpha over comparable passive indices," Marcelli wrote in a note to clients.

Title: The Philosophy of Investing

Time Published: 2024-10-18T20:46:59Z

ERIC KIM Ultimately when people study Warren Buffett, Charlie Munger etc ,,, what all these guys are searching for is wisdom. I think this is good and important because principles wisdom, is resistant to time and technology, but at least for myself, I was born in 1988, searching for practical wisdom has always remained elusive for me. I think difficult thing is that my circumstances were unique. I was born in the states, yet grew up poor; my definition of poor is not being sure whether you would be homeless next month because your dad just gambled away the rent money again, going off to Reno in the middle of the night. I think on two fronts this was useful to me: First, it taught me self independence at a very young age. I knew that if I wanted anything, I had to work for it. This motivated me to pick up lots of part-time jobs when I was like 13, 14 or 15, tutoring English, through my honors program at school, working at the local community center, getting a $200 a month stipend etc. ￼ In fact, my biggest personal pride and joy; essentially, purchasing my first car with my own money! At the age of 15, getting my drivers permit in California, $1000 or maybe $1200 1991 Sentra XE, 5 door sedan, 5 speed manual transmission car — it didn’t even have a tachometer! I learned how to shift gears simply by hearing and feeling the engine? This began my first love affair with manual transmission cars; In fact, another point of pride, every car I have purchased my own money has always been a used manual transmission car, never exceeding $2500 USD. In fact, the last car I purchased one in Providence Rhode Island before Seneca was born was a 2002 Subaru outback, five speed manual transmission, listed on craigslist for 1000 bucks, was able to negotiate down to $900, then $800 in cash! Lying out those eight $100 bills was the most obvious decision I’ve made in my life. ￼￼In terms of my decision-making philosophy, my unorthodox beliefs; obvious decisions are obvious. ￼ What that means is before making any sort of decision life decision etc., you don’t need to think about it too much. Obvious decisions are staring you right at the face, and whenever you have to hesitate before making a certain decision, don’t do it. Why? Your brain is still working out the details, whether or not you should do the thing or not. For example, buying microstrategy stock, MSTR, ￼￼to me is a 100% obvious decision. For the traditional markets, it’s literally the only asset worth purchasing. Why? Essentially they have discovered a free money hack or infinite money hack, which they could leverage their 30-year-old business, which is regulated, and mainstream… And leverage their position, borrowing money at less than one percent to buy bitcoin, which is accretive forever, and continuing the virtuous cycle. Bitcoin is cyber manhattan: 256^3￼ I think the idea of a cyber Manhattan, cyber real estate company is fascinating to me. And the difference between bitcoin, cyber real estate and Cyberman Manhattan is that it is actually backed by real electricity and power. For example, the problems with all these fake virtual worlds is that it is just powered by a computer code, one and zeros, Any nerd can click a button and create a skyscraper in Sim city. But what if, if you wanted to build a skyscraper in Sim city, you actually had to expand $1 billion of real capital in the real world, before transferring it and transporting it to cyberspace? This is the 1000% paradigm shift; The bridge between the physical, embodied reality, ￼ physical world and realm, to the digital cyber realm… Which is still backed with physical electricity? Or it’s a feature, not a bug? I think what a lot of these goody two shoers don’t get or understand is about real life physics in the game, skin in the game, energy in the game. Everyone wants some sort of hidden upside without any real life downside? I’ll give you example, everyone wants to rid the world of suffering pain injustice and the like. However, a life without suffering pain injustice and overcoming is not a life worth living. You cannot have happiness without pain and suffering, nor can you have joy with without sorrow and misery. If we think about this from a Taoist perspective, ￼I think about yin and Yang, you cannot have the good without the bad. You cannot have the virtuous without the evil. For example, obviously being in poor health sucks, and bad weather also sucks. But, when things get much better, you are 1000 times more joyful grateful and happy when things shift! This is why funny enough, I think people on the East Coast, New England, Providence Rhode Island are happier than people in LA because the weather shifts are more extreme. For example, when you’re suffering in the winter time for months on end, no sunshine whatever, and then boom, one day the sun comes out, everyone is overjoyed! It is still 55° and cold, but at least it is sunny; everyone runs out and gets their picnic blankets, And the joy of the sunlight is 1000 times more extreme than in Los Angeles where everyone is trying to hide from the sun, even though they love it? My simple analogy is everyone in LA is like a solid 7.2 out of 10, in terms of happiness, whereas in the East coast, your happiness goes from a -10 to a +500% when the weather is good! ￼ So I suppose, the philosophical question them becomes, is it better or more favorable to have a steady mediocre thing forever, or more extreme highs and lows, which will be a benefit to your happiness? Then a simple thought, the reason why I love bitcoin is because of the extremes; I would prefer an extreme life to a steady and boring one. ￼ I think for me my number one principle in investing ￼￼is yield. I think what a lot of people think is what they’re trying to do with their money is they are trying to securitize it, and make it safe, stored in really really safe assets like treasury bills, bonds, or “safe” investments like Apple Amazon Facebook Google and like. But, my personal thought is life should not be conservative; the point of life isn’t to just conserve your wealth, but rather, to grow it! Even the story of Jesus, you don’t just take your wealth and hide it and bury your talents, your gold talents in the ground because you’re afraid of losing it. No, the virtuous thing is to go out and multiply it! And I also think the same thing is with wealth; the virtuous calling is to multiply it to grow it, not to just bury it, with the fear that it might go down. OK, a lot of these fools, they want quick gains in order to go out and buy the Lamborghini or whatever. But once you find out that only small dick losers drive Lamborghinis, ￼ and also, that the useful lifetime value of a Lamborghini might only be three or four years, that is the point in which the maintenance costs and the insurance costs and fixing it up will destroy the price of it in just three or four years, then it becomes obvious; you wish the Lamborghini onto your worst enemy, you don’t desire one for yourself. ￼ My simple thought is take a stoic spartan approach; essentially live like a super super poor person, the only thing you should ever spend money on is weights barbells and weightlifting equipment, and meet… Everything else should be essentially free. This means, Essentially, the easiest way to become rich is not go broke.￼ So essentially, I’ve literally I think watch every single Michael Saylor interview that he’s ever done everything that he posted to Twitter or YouTube etc. Maybe about 100 of them. Anyways, probably the most fascinating thing that I’ve learned about the value of an asset is the value of an asset is essentially the cost of something or the value is something divided by the maintenance cost. Now I think this is something that people don’t really think about — ￼the maintenance cost. So for example, now that all of my millennial friends are growing up, I’m 36 now, in four years, I’m gonna be 40 years old, everyone’s trying to think about the future buying a single-family home or a condo or property or whatever. And what beguiles a lot of people or shocks people is when they buy a house, all the maintenance costs! Even talking to my friend Anton (congrats on your new kid!) he told me a story while we were in downtown LA about how he bought a house, but the water heater went out, and him having to fix it, and what a nightmare it was. Also simple things that we millennials never think about… You need a new roof and boom, that’s $50,000. That’s $50,000 I would rather put into bitcoin. There are so many things that exist on the planet, in real world, in embody reality which cost a premium in terms of insurance, maintenance, etc. Once again, almost nothing in the physical realm is ever worth it. ￼ If you want a new car, just download some racing game to your iPad, or even PlayStation or whatever; better to spend 50 bucks on a virtual car then drop $50,000 or more on a new one!￼ ￼ Or, just buy an oculus quest, play some racing game, at least this way you want to kill yourself, or another family in a car with two kids or more. –> The worst thing in life isn’t dying or killing yourself, but it is accidentally killing another family, accidentally killing kids in the car seat of another car, and you having to live with the guilt for the rest of your life. ￼￼ Bitcoin is not real, but, if it costs $800 billion to produce, it’s real! Let’s again, things must have a stake in the physical realm, if it doesn’t, it is just air coin, or the foundation is just built on cotton candy. I think we must avoid these fake environmentalists, a bunch of vegan losers. Essentially, if I psychoanalyze a lot of these fake environmentalists; essentially everyone is seeking a new religion, a new godhead which is the “environment“, but ultimately my critical thought is that once again it just comes down to money; For example, Al Gore, I wonder… How much money has he collected from doing his talks on an inconvenient truth, ultimately being funded by taxpayer money? And also, James Cameron, and also Arnold, how much money they have collected from the vegan pea protein powder plant factory, just follow the money. ￼ Much more profitable to sell a $50 container of vegan protein powder, than a meat company to sell beef rib or beef liver. ￼ Also a random aside; if you really wanted to be a real environmentalist, you would actually have a 100% organ meat diet, only beef heart beef liver beef kidneys and intestines, because these parts are typically thrown away. “Being naked is the ultimate sustainable option. We’re number two.” – Reformation marketing copy ￼ The truth is environmentalism is very profitable. For example a lot of these clothing companies, I think also like the new one “Reformation“, a female clothing company, they talk about sustainability and blah blah blah, but once again, is it just another marketing tactic to sell their mediocre clothes. For example, people talk that leather in animal products are evil blah blah blah. Yet the truth is, you’re cheap vegan leather jacket which is made out of petroleum is probably 1 trillion times worse for the planet than a fashionable one made out of 100% real leather. A pleather vegan jacket might only last you a few years, a good leather jacket can you last you 50 or beyond.￼ Because if you critically think about it, things which last, are better for the “environment”. And typically animal products last. I love leather!￼ Also nowadays, people talk about Native Americans and stuff like that, don’t you know that historically the way that natives lived off the land was in harmony with animals, like can you imagine a Native American who didn’t use animal power, ride on horses, or eat meat and bison? Besides maybe virtue signaling America, ￼there is no great civilization that has ever existed without animal products whether food labor etc. ￼ Once again I think the biggest issue is in today’s world, nobody likes risk anymore. Risk is seen as something which is dangerous bad and to be avoided. For example anybody who buys a Mercedes car an Audi, a Porsche a Lamborghini whatever… It is ultimately a risk free option in the sense that no one’s gonna make fun of you for owning those type of cars. So in some ways it is a cowardly act; For example everyone thinks a Porsche 911 is cool, a Lamborghini is cool, a Mercedes or an Audi is cool. Yet ￼ maybe I’m the only one with the big dick in the room, I brag that I drive a Toyota Prius? Everyone is always so shocked and impressed. Real investors and economists must and should drive a Prius! OK, whenever I discover anybody who’s a professor, who teaches in a business school, is an economist, academic or scholar or whatever… Yet just puts all of their money in a boring mutual fund… Or index fund… It is a signal that they are not a real economist, and they are actually not really connected to reality. We need some sort of risk exposure to the real world. For example, easy to be the typical fat American who is drinking beer or wine watching sports and American football, giving their opinion on sports teams and players yet they are not actually exposed to the risk of playing real tackle football? And once again… The more I think about it the more bizarre it is. To watch UFC or mixed martial arts, to watch any sport that you have not yourself played… It kind of like mental masturbation? To sports? Sports is masculine physical sports masturbation pornography? Just think about it the average person eats nachos french fries drink beer or alcohol smoke marijuana before watching the big game. But what a athlete who is actually participating in the sport down a beer really quick before putting on their armor and hitting the field? Obviously not! So why is it that alcohol food beverages is marketed to these individuals, for watching a sport? It is the new risk free premium hedonism; the joy of seeing people get murdered on a field, or in our arena without any real exposure. People are always so surprised that I played real football real American tackle football in high school, they are shocked to hear that I was linebacker, first outside linebacker then inside linebacker. ￼ I think it is actually racism; you never expect an Asian guy to play linebacker because we are not seen as masculine or aggressive enough. But if I were African-American or black, even though I am on the more lean side — you probably would not be shocked, because in America, athletes are always seen as being African-American, never Asian. Even an Asian professional sports athlete is almost seen as a glitch in the system, not the real deal. Even when first deadlifted 465 pounds, sumo style off the floor, and everyone was so shocked, I was talking to my friend Jemal and I asked him — “If I was African-American or black, but people will be asshocked or surprised?” He laughed and said no! So I think the first thing you have to think philosophically is what are you really searching for, and why? My very simple thought is think 300 years ahead, your kids kids kids. The current lifestyle is like the Persian slave lifestyle?￼ I think the issue we are facing today in today’s world is hedonism — the new hedonism. We seek companionship through humans or dogs, yet we don’t want to have children, we want to preserve our freedom travel the world go to Japan eat good sushi whatever. But, your dog cannot inherit your bitcoin. ￼￼ I think maybe in the past life was actually easier and more straightforward people. You got married, you built up a family legacy and empire; this was actually a pretty good strategy in life. And I think people were actually much happier, productive, and joyful! Think about all the modern day melodies of depression anxiety whatever, they are all modern day sociological ills. In fact, the ancient Greeks, thinking about the Iliad; certainly things are natural like courage, cowardice, and fear… But depression anxiety was not. My sociological theory on why so many people are so depressed and anxious is because of YouTube, Spotify, podcast, TikTok Facebook Instagram, Twitter, news, fear porn. ￼ Have a theory; a lot of people are secretly waiting and twiddling their thumbs, they actually want to see the world burn to the floor, to be able to have the indignant feeling; “I told you… I was right all along!” For example, all these people, are during Covid and pre-Covid and post Covid whatever, thought that there was gonna be food riots and blah blah blah, none of it happened. Humans are 1 trillion times more resilient than we make them out to be. ￼This is where also, philosophically I don’t really believe in short selling; even if you could cop a massive profit. For example there are certain things that I am certain which will go down to zero, like Ada Cardano and the like because it is fake. But rather than hoping that something is going to burn the floor, better to just bet on things that you think that will go to Mars! ￼ For example, everyone hates Elon Musk, and they are secretly waiting and plotting for him to fail. Yet doesn’t it take more courage to wish and hope and desire to see people succeed? Even I remember the Tesla model 3; everyone thought it would be impossible, but now, it is certainly the new Ford model T; the coolest, most desirable, most futuristic and affordable car on the road. I personally plan on driving my Toyota Prius until it dies at 1,000,000 miles, but if for one reason or another I was forced to purchase a brand new car, it would definitely be a Tesla, maybe the robotaxi? The reason why I encourage everyone to watch the Robo taxi, Robo van announcement is that it is the ultimate disruptor. For example, the Robo van, the two door coupe, insanely awesome design, with the butterfly McLaren doors… I find like there is no more reason to ever even want to buy a loser Lamborghini, or McLaren or whatever. And I really really love that rose gold, MATTE Rose gold Color on the Robo taxi, and also the rims look awesome! Once again, assuming that you’re a futurist like myself, the trillion dollar questions “why doesn’t the future actually look like the future?“ For example, if you really do believe in the digital transformation of things, like you care about Apple Tesla Amazon Facebook digital media whatever… Why would you ever buy analog property like a single-family home or whatever? Wouldn’t you prefer to buy digital property which is bitcoin? And also, issues with tax, property tax. Also assuming that you’re a libertarian, or some sort of anti-government person, bitcoin makes sense because it is like digital or cyber real estate that can’t be taxed! And I think the truth is that real rich people, know how to do tax deferment, or to avoid taxes, this is a real reason they become and stay rich. “My accountant so good I’m practically living tax-free!” – JAY Z￼￼￼ For example, even if you live in the lowest tax jurisdiction place which is Florida, and nobody wants to live in Florida, still… Under a base case scenario you’re still playing at least 1.1% in taxes. And that means then, the life of your asset is only 70 years; within 70 years Assuming you buy a $1 million property, you’re gonna pay $1 million in taxes in 70 years. Then, if you own a single-family home or whatever, or property the coal is actually trying to rent out your property at a premium, but two people who have never really had experience with property property management… It is a fucking nightmare and headache. Finding good tenants and keeping them; the holy Grail. Too much counterparty risk with properties; people who fuck up your property, end up not paying rent in squatting your place, people who start to grow marijuana inside your property, people who turn your property into a brothel (true story), or just physical wear and tear and decay. Anything in the physical realm in my opinion has too much risk. ￼And this is where still… In my eyes, Tesla is too much of a risk. Why? Having to build all those cyber trucks, Robo taxis, is just in my opinion, too much of a gargantuan physical task. Even if you automate the whole thing with robots, still, extracting lithium from the Earth, making the cars, delivering the cars, my personal estimate is you won’t see Robo taxis on the road for at least another five or seven years? To me that is too long. I think the best investment is something that you have a 100% certainty will go up in 30 years, and you just ignore the volatility and the noise on a day-to-day level. Yes especially if it is digital!￼ Also the funny thing is; bitcoin was the classic the first only immaculate conception; technically Ethereum from Vitalik was just a bitcoin copycat.￼ My very very basic suggestion is just download Coinbase to your phone, buy bitcoin from your traditional bank account, and once you’re done buying it, delete the Coinbase app from your phone, and never check prices. And what you doing instead it’s just go to michael.com, watch all the Michael sailor interviews, and read books on economic theory philosophy etc. I personally believe that the best wisdom is in the past; read Aristotle on economics, Fernandinho Galiani on money Della moneta, the principles of economic theory from Karl Menger etc. you should be able to find free PDFs of all these online, just read it on your iPad. ￼*** You buy the bitcoin, and you never sell it, just keep buying it until you die, and the idea is just give it to your kids kids kids. And you’re a supreme happiness and joy is through weightlifting, one red maxing, and seeing the numbers go up! ￼ My suggestion is never ever ever sell the bitcoin, for anything. If you need spare cash for living or whatever, better to borrow the money at 7% interest or lower, assuming that bitcoin is going to go up 21% year over a year, compounded rate forever. ￼ I would say only by microstrategy MSTR if you just cannot get access to capital to buy bitcoin directly. At the end of your life, he or she with the most bitcoin is going to be the winner. Or the corporate entity like micro strategy, who owns the most bitcoin. The goal is a Nakamoto, which is the mythical 1 million bitcoins. The same amount of bitcoins in Satoshi‘s wallet, which he hasn’t touched. ￼￼This is currently $60 billion! ￼ honestly because I live like a poor person, for me, at this point investing is just a new passion, almost like a new hobby. Still for me my critical passion is photography, blogging and like. ￼So the simple thought; know that investing in money is a means to an end not the in itself.

Zody II by Haworth Most people under invest in their office chair while working from home. It’s likely the most important piece of furniture that will determine how you feel physically and if ergonomic — will help you avoid things like future back pain. The best piece of advice I received was to always try a chair in person to make sure it’s the right fit for you. What I love about the Zody II by Haworth is that it’s the perfect cross between form and function. Because of back pain, my chiropractor recommends that I stand every 30 minutes which means I have to lift my desk to use it as a standing desk. The Zody II has a perch function (dual posture configuration) where you can raise it high enough and you can use the forward tilt feature which allows your seat to slope forward so you can extend your legs. Haworth has coined it forward tilt adjustment, if you ensure your configuration includes it you wont’ regret it. Additional ergonomic features include being able to adjust your seat depth and lumbar support. I’ve found myself adjusting the arm height frequently depending on if I’m actively typing or just listening in a Zoom meeting to take relief off my shoulders. Depending on preference, you can move the arms inward or outward which I often find myself adjusting as well. The Zody II includes other features which you’d expect in premium chair like easily adjusting the tension and seat height. What’s also fun is that you can customize things like color and fabric to truly make it your own. While the Zody II carries a premium price tag (which can depend on configuration), Haworth recently introduced the Breck chair which nails all ergonomic requirements without breaking the bank. Sitting in Breck feels responsive and you can adjust height and seat depth easily. They’ve designed the lumbar support to be easily adjusted and overall it’s more comfortable than most office chairs I’ve sat in over the years. Breck Office Chair Many companies provide an office stipend and if you can get your work to cover this expense it’s a great value for chair with a 12-year warranty for around $500. Purchasing can be a personal decision, like buying a mattress. Sometimes you need to try it out for a while or even a couple of visits to feel comfortable in your decision. As was told to me, try the chairs in person if you can as Haworth as a dealer locater available on their website. One of the most versatile pieces of furniture I’ve used comes from a company called Joybird. Buying nice furniture online can feel like a gamble, thankfully they have showrooms in major cities across the country. While it can naturally be used as a bedroom dresser, I prefer to use it as office storage in my living room. Fenton Chest What surprised me most was the quality of the Fenton Chest which is made with solid Acacia and engineered wood with walnut veneers. It feels well crafted and is made to last. It also arrived put together which is a huge plus. It’s also a nice touch that the top drawer is lined with a felt base. I solicited Gifty Walker, Director of Merchandising at Joybird, about what pieces of furniture people should consider when building their home office from scratch. “Since I personally need my home office to double as a guest room, I would first build around a sleeper sofa. My top picks are our Briar or Miller Sleeper Sofa. From there, I’d go with our Carver Desk. It’s the perfect size and it has drawers to keep things organized and out of sight for when you have guests over. To complete the room, I’d select the Monroe Floor Lamp that gives just the right amount of lighting for ambiance and video calls, while the machine washable Radha Rug helps tie your space together. Plus, the rug is a breeze to clean.” Gifty mentioned that storage is often one of the aspects often overlooked. She suggests considering a desk with built-in storage or a secondary furniture piece like a console cabinet to maximize space. I have a standing desk that has a small drawer so I can appreciate more storage especially within arms reach. While Joybird is rooted in Mid-Century style and bold colors, they’ve adapted to color trends like whites and neutral palettes. Another strong differentiator is that Joybird actually manufactures all of their customizable upholstery pieces. You can see their unique design embedded into much of their furniture pieces as they cover everything from home office to dining room and even decor pieces. “Where does the inspiration come from?” I asked. “When it comes to interior design, inspiration can be found anywhere. We spend time at trade and design shows that give us glimpses into what’s coming. Since design is not solely about aesthetics, but it is also about function and utility, we may see something that could be amazing but not resonate with our customer so we’ll modify based on what customers have shown interest in through sales. Interior trends and colors specifically often follow the fashion industry so we will keep a pulse on that. Other great sources are architecture design and nature. Think about the doorway arches and now we’ve seen that become a trend when it comes to rounded edges over clean and sharp corners. Green is often a top design color because it provides the same calming effects of being in nature,” Gifty explained. Perhaps my biggest takeaway from Gifty is that we often have to think about multi-functional spaces instead of the traditional dedicated office with traditional furniture. She said this shows up as a guest room and office combination and we need the right pieces like a sleeper sofa to fit the room’s needs from day to night. It’s a great reminder to question furniture purchases with function in mind. One of the significant changes I’ve made is my wardrobe. I don’t want to wear jeans at home because they’re not exactly comfortable, but I also don’t feel the best version of myself when I’m wearing sweatpants while I’m working. Men's Everywhere Pant Cozy Earth is widely known for their super soft bedding and they’ve extended their line into clothing. The Men’s Everywhere Pant is just that — I can wear them all day at work and run out for errands while being comfortable and never feeling like I have to change. They pair nicely with their Everyday Polo and unlike every other polo I’ve owned they don’t shrink after washing them (ideally cold water and hang drying). Working from home has motivated me to cook more. I’ve picked up the hobby of batch juicing and even bake bread for the family. I’ve used Caraway pots and pans for a few years and naturally learning how to use stainless steel was my next step as it’s generally a safe option to avoid toxins in your food. However, there is a bit of a learning curve. Stainless Steel Cookware Set You can be captivated by the colors and appearance of the Caraway lineup and I’ve found their Stainless Steel Cookware Set to deliver on that same promise. Stainless steel is designed to have more heat retention than non-stick pans. When used properly, your food should not stick to the pan. One of my favorite Caraway pieces is their dutch oven. As you may know, not all dutch ovens are created equal because the way one cooks may be slightly different from another. I’ve made braised short ribs thanks to YouTube chef Alison Roman to perfection with their dutch oven. Their stainless steel set, however, comes generously with four pieces and a nicely sized 10.5’’ frying pan which I find myself using most often — especially to make a quick and healthy piece of salmon. The pan storage unit it comes with has been very helpful for organization and since they’re stacked horizontally it prevents them from scratching one another. While it’s an investment in the stainless steel set, it seems built to last like my previous Caraway set. Over the last few years I’ve continued to tweak and optimize my home office and desk setup. There are two lights I’ve come across that have been very unique and could be useful depending on your needs. As someone who has a standing desk and attempts to minimize clutter in my office space, I have numerous mounts from Elgato that have been invaluable. The mounts themselves have eliminated the need for two tripods around my desk. I also used to have a key light which was my main source of light on myself along with a massive light box hanging above my desk. It’s a big space commitment for this type of lighting and it doesn’t look conducive if you’re trying to use the space for other things. Elgato Key Light Air Elgato makes a number of light sources, but what I like about their Key Light Air is that it’s an edge-lit LED panel with a small footprint that packs a big punch in terms of lighting. They come with very solid stands, but once again I use their Master Mount L to clamp both lights at the edges of my desk. I was skeptical about how much light these would produce, given their name “Air” and comparing them to the other models with larger LED panels. However, I can tell you I often have them in the 5-10% range of brightness and it’s plenty lit. The one thing to note is that they are controlled through the Elgato app. That means after pairing the lights you have to use the app to turn them on or change the brightness and color temperature. I haven’t had any major issues and it seems to work well most of the time. Once in a blue moon it will take an app refresh for both lights to connect. They have an on and off switch behind the panel, but it would be a nice touch if you could modify the brightness with a physical button. Just something to consider if you feel like you prefer a physical switch on a light. Dyson’s floor lamp is called the Solarcycle Morph and it definitely looks like something out of this world. There are many things that are unique about it but one of the benefits I appreciate is that is serves a dual purpose. You can extend the light out to shine directly or you can magnetically snap the light back into the tall cylinder and it creates an ambient light. The ambient light is perfect for reading, relaxing, and it’s the perfect lighting for the background of a Zoom call. Dyson Solarcycle Morph The Solarcycle has physical buttons and you can control the same settings through the Dyson app. The light also has a USB-C charging port on bottom, a feature I have not used often but it’s a convenience for some. Dyson offers a desktop model but I prefer the floor lamp if you have the space for it. Dyson is widely known for their vacuums and other beautifully designed items like cooling fans. One thing that’s important to me is saving space. They have a product that acts as both a cooling system, heater, and an air purifier called the Purifier Hot+Cool Formaldehyde purifying fan heater. It’s a mouthful but deservedly so because it has three functions in one so I don’t need a fan, space heater, and air purifier. While I have all of those products separately, I’ve been able to put them in storage for now. The same Dyson app will pair with both the light and the purifying fan heater which is convenient. I mentioned batch juicing. One of the staples in my kitchen over the last year has been the Nama J2 juicer. It’s newest addition, the J3, is equally impressive. J3 Cold Press Juicer Because of the chambers that slow juice, it saves time because you can cut fruits and vegetables as you go and then put them inside. If you have children who like to help, it makes juicing fun because they get to watch the fruits swirl around as they begin to go down the chamber. Cleaning up takes about five minutes as you should hand wash and dry when you can to avoid any stains on the juicer itself. While I’ve made many batches of juice with it’s predecessor, the J3 yields about 16 oz of juice which is half as much as the J2. It also has a smaller sized base which makes it a great option for apartment living or if you like to travel with your juicer. If you plan to drink your juice right away it might make sense to consider J3. Performance wise they have the same motor (50 rpm). One thing I’d recommend, whether you use a Nama juicer or an alternative — find at least one recipe book that will inspire you to try new recipes. I typically make two juices per week. One being the green juice staple, and the other will either will be a rotating recipe or something completely new depending on what’s in season. As you cook more in the kitchen you have a need for different types of knives. As an adult, the only real knife I purchased was a Togiharu from Blue Apron that I broke in half inside of a watermelon. It was probably my fault, however, there are two brothers — Jared and Jordan, who have reinvented this houseware category. So much so that I can’t take a trip Costco without noticing one of their beautiful sets of knives. Cutlery Knife Set Admittedly, I’ve also bought knives that come in a pack of three from Bed Bath & Beyond and they ended up in the garbage within a few months. These knives are built to last as they’re made with German stainless steel. I always hand wash them and try to dry them right away and the condition of them remains outstanding. You can invest $150 in a set of knives that will probably last you at least a decade or more. The sets typically come with a small manual that tells you exactly what each knife is for — and honestly I’ve misplaced mine. Nonetheless — the chef’s knife works flawlessly. The bread knife works as advertised, and whether you’re cutting through a watermelon or a steak you’ll feel like you’re using a thousand dollar knife. What’s nice about their knife blocks is that you can keep them up and away from the kids rather than having them easily accessible in a drawer. I highly recommend it if you have little ones roaming around the kitchen. Another office solution that I wish I discovered years ago is the combination of the monitor arm by Humanscale along with their M/Connect 3 and Pro Dock. It’s given my desk plenty more room because I can put away my clunky stand that came with my Lenovo monitor. The arm is one of the most ergonomic inventions on the market. I used to use one from Fully (now Herman Miller) — but the Humanscale design and functionality makes it the iPhone of monitor arms. It’s beautiful and minimalistic. I also use my monitor as a movie screen and I can easier bring it forward with no hassle. What’s even more interesting is the hub on bottom. One of the biggest issues with a monitor that is also designed as a docking station is that all of your wires and connections hang from the monitor. I have an 8-inch hub literally hanging off the side of my monitor which is an eye sore. M/Connect 3 with monitor arm Taking a look under the hood, there’s an actual dock that sits below your desk — out of sight. In other words, you get the benefits of the minimalistic space saving design with the additional USB and USB-C charging ports, as well as the entire hub clamped under your desk (see below). M/Connect 3 with Pro Dock Unless you need your monitor stand and have a docking solution you’re in love with, I can’t think of a cleaner and more efficient setup. I know many people like to have a dual monitor, so you can pick and choose which type of monitor arm makes the most sense for you. You can also decide on three colors in terms of the Pro Dock that suites your color scheme. My standing desk has white legs so I prefer the white dock. Set aside 30 minutes to setup your monitor arm and docking station and you should be in business. Humanscale’s Vice President of Product Management, Mark Consolla, shared how your home office setup can support your overall health and productivity. "An ergonomic home office setup is essential for maximizing both your health and productivity. With more people working remotely, it's critical that workstations at the home are designed to support comfort and well-being. Our M2.1 monitor arm, with its easy-to-assemble and dynamically configurable design, helps users achieve an optimal ergonomic position, reducing strain and promoting better posture throughout the day. By investing in tools like the M2.1, professionals can enhance both their efficiency and their long-term health wherever they work." One of the tech gadgets I’ve found myself using most over the last few months is a device from Courant called the MAG:2 Classics. Essentially, it magnetically connects to my iPhone and serves a dual purpose. It’s a charger and a phone stand in one — as well as having a place to charge your AirPods on the base as well. I’m a fan of the brown leather look while they also have a linen option. MAG:2 Classics I find myself carrying it around with me much of the day. It’ll be at my desk when I’m working. In the kitchen if I’m cooking or washing dishes so I can watch YouTube clips. I’ve also used it to play workout videos because it serves as the perfect stand. It has a non-slip construction so you can use it almost anywhere. MAG:3 Classics Courant also makes a charging catch trays, one which they’ve coined the MAG:3 Classics. It has the MagSafe capability so your iPhone and AirPods will connect and charge very easily. I have it by my bedside and use it daily. I also don’t want to scratch the wood on my nightstand which is another reason why I keep it there for protection. One of the staples for any office space is an area rug, unless you’re in a carpeted room of course. Ensuring that you have a run on hardwood floors will also help with your sound quality as you want furniture and things to fill the room to avoid an echo. I searched high and low for a contemporary rug that’s easy to clean and I kept coming across a company called Revival. Their Shell rug was exactly what I was looking for. It’s very soft on your feet and easy to vacuum. Some rugs are insanely heavy. This was folded and packaged nicely, and it was light enough for me to carry around by myself. This specific rug comes in 4 color and 11 different sizing options. Always be sure to have a rug pad underneath because it will feel nicer and provide your rug with longevity. Shell washable rug I solicited Ben Hyman, co-founder and CEO of Revival about the inspiration behind the Shell rug. “We wanted to make a machine-washable rug that didn’t read as washable, but instead looked and felt as thick and soft as a standard hand-knotted rug. It was important to us to use recycled materials. The look of the collection was inspired by the accidental designs you find on the beach, made by waves on sand.” Revival is most known at the intersection between quality, design, variety, and affordability. However, buying a rug online is difficult. While it’s not exactly like buying a mattress — people often want to see and experience the rug in person before making the commitment. I asked Hyman how they’ve tried to make that experience more seamless for the customer. “Since the beginning we’ve invested heavily in our photography and descriptions to make sure we’re conveying all the important details about each rug. We have impeccable customer service, well-designed boxes, free shipping, complimentary interior design consultations, an augmented reality tool that lets you view your rug in your room, and a swatch program, so you can order samples of our bestselling rugs before you buy. We’re also constantly investing in the digital user experience on our website so that the experience feels intuitive and snappy. Collectively, these features make Revival a special place to shop.” Some people prefer a wool rug but they’re often very expensive. Typically, you have to take them to a rug cleaner which you have to take into consideration when it comes to the lifetime cost of the rug. Hyman and his global team have leveraged having a presence in places like Casablanca and Istanbul because it gives them access to local artisans. They’ve also somehow made wool rugs that are washable. “We’re proud of the R&D we’ve done around rug utility and sustainability, without compromising design. This focus on construction and materiality has resulted in products like our washable wool Lino and Helen rugs.” The team at Revival has kept their pulse on the market over the last few years, adapting to the needs of customers. “We started off as a purveyor of vintage rugs, a small niche within the much broader rug category. Early on we realized we needed to find a way to offer customers more than vintage; that it was important they have access to a wider range of time periods, including contemporary. Within a few years of producing new rugs it became clear customers were looking for washables, which has become a huge part of our business. it’s been a gradual evolution,” Hyman explained. While the pandemic wasn’t exactly an accelerator like it was for many e-commerce companies — there was a silver living for the team at Revival. “In 2020 we launched items like other textiles and furniture on the site. Yet we struggled to find our footing from both an operational and marketing perspective in these other categories, as we spread our small team too thin. In 2022 we came full circle, pivoting back to a more exclusive focus on rugs, and expanding our offering further in that category. This additional focus on high-quality, affordable rugs sets us apart; it took a while – and some missteps – to get there.” This led to them eventually establishing a significant inventory in the US so that stock issues wouldn’t hold them back, and rugs could ship out to their customers in 2-3 days. As we concluded our interview, I solicited Hyman for the best piece of advice he’d give someone shopping for a rug. “First — measure your room. Second — buy a rug pad. These two surprisingly simple things will make a huge difference in how good your rug looks.” One of the habits I’ve broken (in a good way) is buying coffee out and it’s saved a lot of money. I typically make tea at home but one thing that becomes frustrating is that my tea is either too hot or too cold. Enter the Ember Mug 2. Ember Mug 2 To admit, I was skeptical at first. However, when I keep the tea temperature at 145 degrees it’s just right — and the Mug 2 can keep that temperature for 80 minutes off the charger. The temperature can be controlled through their app and the design and color options are sleek. I do wish, however, they made an even larger option than 14 oz. It’s definitely big enough to function well but I am a fan of large mugs. I’ve also found and tested a $13 mug warmer from a local grocery store and it did the job, but you have to keep it on your desk or within reach. That’s a nice touch with the Mug 2 is that you can keep the charger in the kitchen and not have to worry about more clutter on your desk. I’m often looking for ways to save time and one tool that’s been helpful is the robotic pool cleaner by Polaris, specifically the FREEDOM Plus model. FREEDOM Plus Overall, using a robotic cleaner has saved me nearly 8 hours per month of manually scrubbing the pool and I don’t get the lactic acid and soreness built up in my shoulders and arms. Also, robotic cleaners use less energy because you don’t have to rely on the pool’s filtration system as often. I appreciated how lightweight thee FREEDOM Plus is because it makes it very portable. The inclusion of a charger stand with wheels makes it even more portable and convenient. The cordless feature is a notable advantage, as it eliminates the risk of entanglement and allows for uninterrupted use of the pool while the device is operational. This is a substantial improvement over traditional corded pool cleaners, which can be cumbersome and restrictive. While most robotic cleaners come with a hefty price tag it’s definitely worth exploring so you can save more time and invest that elsewhere. An important tip I learned from a course I took on setting up a home studio is the importance of plants in your Zoom background. It plays a significant role in how people perceive your office. One of the keys is to use artificial plants because you will always have a consistent look compared to a real plant that changes shape every so often. One of the biggest drawbacks to real plants is that there is often more work involved than meets the eye. You can’t just “set it and forget it.” Most plants need to be in sunlight and if they have issues you have to troubleshoot the humidity in your office and a plethora of other things that become more work. If you are a plant enthusiast that is another story. Artificial Fiddle Leaf Fig Tree with Artisan Planter CG Hunter is a company who makes artificial plants and trees. I’ve traversed every craft store that carries artificial plants and CG Hunter’s quality is in another stratosphere. I initially came across some of their trees at Costco was floored because I thought they were real. What are the benefits of an artificial tree versus a real one? I asked an executive at CG Hunter. “Faux plants and trees bring the beauty of nature into the home or office without the maintenance. They provide the lush vibrancy of real plants without the need for watering or sunlight, making them perfect for spaces with low light. With their low maintenance and long-lasting durability, they offer a cost-effective way to enhance any space without the need for ongoing care. Artificial plants are also pet friendly.” I solicited them for any additional considerations. “It is important to consider scale when buying faux trees as you want to use them to deliver height or fullness and dimension as well as texture, color, and pattern. Carefully selected faux trees and plants can be used to hide unsightly plugs or cords other blemishes in a room.” It’s so true. If you use a standing desk, you want to be mindful about how your plants and trees are visible in the background depending on whether you sit or stand. My chiropractor recommended I stand every 30 minutes — so I’m always keeping that in mind. For example, if my plant is too short and I lift my desk then it may be out of sight. I’ve found it helpful to turn on a Zoom meeting, setup your background, and look at your monitor to see what the other people would see. One other pro tip is to have the plan partially in your shot because it makes the length and size of the room feel larger than it may be in real life. close up of Fiddle Leaf Fig Tree One thing I like about the Fiddle Leaf Fig Tree (pictured above) is the thickness of the leaves. If you are using a high quality web cam or a mirrorless camera for Zoom, you want to have a slight blur in the background. Not the kind of blur Zoom offers because your room is messy — I mean the slight blur that you see on a quality video podcast. Thicker greenery will often pop in your picture. As you can see the texture of the trees from CG Hunter truly come alive. Most importantly you have to test things out in your environment and see what works for you based on what look you are trying to achieve. Lastly, one of my favorite items that I’ve used to and from the office and coffee shops is my Briggs & Riley backpack. What I love most about it is that it doesn’t slouch over like most brands. You can sit it on the floor or next to your desk and it keeps shape. The design is thoughtful and intentional, and it has every compartment you would need — even for a quick flight. It always serves as my carry-on when I travel. Medium Cargo Backpack Like their timeless luggage, the backpack just works and it matches just about any wardrobe. What also makes Briggs & Riley stand out is their customer service. I’ve had luggage have issues in the past because the airline slammed them during transport and Briggs & Riley has fixed them with their lifetime warranty. They’ve also nailed the intersection of quality and price with unique products that last a liftetime. My previous favorite shoe that was easy to put on and incredibly comfortable was the Hupana Flow by HOKA. While they have discontinued the model, what I like about the Transport shoe is that have the quick-toggle laces where you don’t have to tie your shoes. You can just pull up the tongue and slip your feet in and go. HOKA is widely known for making the most comfortable shoes and this model delivers on that promise.

What I’ve found is that the further you go towards a rainboot, the less comfortable shoes can be. The Vibram outsole, which can be found on other models, makes it especially nice for the elements. So far these have been very comfortable and I’m glad they come in a wide option. Personally, I like to limit clutter around the front door so there are usually two pairs of shoes there. One for working out and another for running errands. I probably won’t throw away my Hupanas until there are more holes in them, but I’m optimistic the Transports will replace them in the near future.
