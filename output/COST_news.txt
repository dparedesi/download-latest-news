Title: Worst CEOs of the Year: Brian Cornell of Target
URL: https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/12/01/worst-ceos-of-the-year-brian-cornell-of-target/

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Alex Wong / Getty Images News via Getty Images This is the next in our series on the worst CEOs in America. There will be an all-time winner later in the year. These chief executives were picked based on their major strategy stumbles, as well as how decisions they made affected shareholders, customers, and employees. Some of these CEOs are fairly new to the public corporations they run. Others have had their jobs for years. It is a good thing for investors that they will not have Target Corp. (NYSE: TGT) CEO Brian Cornell to kick around anymore. He has taken the retailer through a ruinous period. He took the job in 2014. The Target board showed remarkably bad judgment and kept Cornell on as executive board chair. In a second shocking development, the board made Michael Fiddelke, current chief operating officer, the new CEO as of February 1, 2026. As Cornell ruined Target, Fiddelke helped him. When the board announced the decision, Neil Saunders of GlobalData commented, “The biggest mistake is actually keeping Brian Cornell on the board and making him the chair. It’s just ludicrous. You’re rewarding failure, and everybody at Target knows that.” jeepersmedia / Flickr Target’s stock performance has been horrible. Over the past five years, it is down 49% while the market is up 88%. In the past year, it is down 30% as the market has risen 15%. Year to date, the figures are about the same. By way of comparison, Walmart Inc. (NYSE: WMT) stock is up 118% in the past five years and Costco Wholesale Corp. (NASDAQ: COST) 135% higher. Target has been dogged quarter after quarter by bad earnings. In the most recently reported quarter, net sales fell 1.5% to $25.3 billion. Earnings decreased 18.2% to $1.52 per share. For the first three quarters of the year, the figures were just as poor. Revenue fell 1.7% to $74.3 billion, and earnings dropped 9.6% to $5.85 per share. According to Yahoo Finance, of 38 analysts who follow Target, 28 rate it as Sell or Hold. Their average price target is $96.52, barely up from the current price of $90.62. As Morningstar pointed out, “Though the 2026 leadership transition from CEO Brian Cornell (after 11 years at the helm) to COO Michael Fiddelke (a 20-year veteran of the business) could incite change, we’re skeptical it will be meaningful enough to regain lost market share or materially shift Target’s competitive standing given his long tenure at the retailer.” It may be that the largest single insult to Target shareholders is that Cornell made $20,407,603 in 2024. The insult to employees is that he made 753 times their median compensation. During the period when Cornell was CEO, everyone lost but him.

Cyber Monday 2025 Absolute Best Deals Deals Under $100 Laptop Deals Kindle Deals Apple Deals Tech Deals Headphone Deals Sleep Deals Phone Deals Coffee Deals Smart Birdfeeder Deals If you're a Costco member, you're no stranger to a nice discount, it's one of the things that makes that $65 per year worth the cost. Even so, Costco tends to go all out for Cyber Monday, luring members into the warehouse with the sweet smell of discounts on game consoles, kitchen gadgets, and computers, not to mention $1.50 hot dogs. I've scoured the ads and circled some of the WIRED gear team's favorite stuff for you, leading you straight to savings that would make even the biggest Kirkland doubter jealous. The discounts below are available now, though availability between online delivery and in-warehouse sales may be a little different depending on your location. For more great discounts, check out our Best Cyber Monday Deals roundup and all of our deals coverage here. KitchenAid KitchenAid Amazon Shop at Crate & Barrel You're likely to find a Kitchen-Aid Stand Mixer on the counter of almost any serious home chef, and for good reason. The renowned reliability and consistency has earned it a spot on our list of products you can buy for life, and mine has earned a permanent spot on on my counter, despite limited space. You can pick up the mixer, a 6-quart bowl, four attachments, and a pouring shield, for just $320, a $100 break off of Costco's usual price. Costco frequently discounts the heftier bowl-lift version, which I find useful for squeezing under my low cabinets, but this Cyber Monday deal is particularly juicy. There are three colors available, and while mine at home is the classic silver, if I had to do it again I'd go with the matte black. Ninja Amazon Crate & Barrel WIRED writer Matthew Korfhage is a big fan of the Ninja Slushi, a delightful drink maker for stirring up smoothies and margaritas at home. Just a few days ago, he spotted it on sale for $270, and it's not a competition, but Costco members can save an additional $20 on a special 96-oz version that includes two insulated cups with bubble tops. This compact machine makes drinks, keeps them frozen for 12 hours, and has easy machine-washable parts so nothing gets too sticky in between parties. Dyson Best Buy Amazon (V15 Detect) Amazon (V15 Detect Plus) Dyson The excellent Dyson V15 Detect is one of our favorite stick vacuums, and it's deeply discounted to just $500 at Costco, beating both Amazon and Best Buy by $50 while still including a suite of 10 accessories. The Detect naming comes from this vacuum's special trick, which analyzes the dust in front of it and adjusts your power to suit the mess. Is that a bit over-engineered for a stick vacuum? Maybe. But the results are hard to argue with, and it's one of our favorite Dyson vacuums for good reason. Apple Amazon (15-inch) Best Buy (13-inch) Apple Amazon (13-inch) If you're feeling more portable, you can also snag an Apple MacBook Air from Costco for just $750. It features similar specs to the Mac Mini above, with a 10-core M4 processor, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD. Reviewer Brenda Stolyar really liked this version of the machine, which pairs snappy performance with a smart screen and great battery life, and it's really only held back by limited ports and some heat management issues. Unlike the other sales, this one is only available until it sells out. Apple Amazon Best Buy Apple The compact Mac Mini from 2024 may be slightly dated, but it's still an excellent buy, especially with the Cyber Monday discount Costco has running, which brings the price down to just $480. It's fairly well equipped for its generation, with 16GB of memory, 256GB of SSD storage, and the 10-core Apple M4 processor, making it one of the least expensive devices with support for Apple Intelligence features. Sony Best Buy Walmart Amazon If you've been looking to upgrade your gaming setup ahead of those cold winter months, Costco has the Sony PlayStation 5 and an extra DualSense wireless controller for just $480. Considering the controllers run anywhere from $50-75 on their own, you're getting a noticeable discount on the console on top of being able to play with a friend. Bose Amazon B&H Bose They may be fresh on the market, but that won't stop Costco from knocking $50 off the Bose QuietComfort Ultra 2. WIRED writer Ryan Waniata recently got to spend some time with the sequel to one of our favorite noise-canceling headphones, and despite only minor upgrades, they still manage to improve the formula with new convenience features and the same great comfort and sound. Sonos Amazon Walmart The Sonos Arc Ultra is our favorite sound bar for standalone Dolby Atmos support, and Costco has it marked down to $880, just a dollar higher than Amazon's current price. Our reviewer Ryan Waniata was extremely impressed with the expansive soundstage, profound bass, and excellent clarity. It's also helped along by the updated mobile app, which has improved drastically over the last few iterations, and is particularly smart if you're already in the Sonos ecosystem.

Title: Best Cyber Monday 2025 Apple deals: Black Friday savings on iPad, AirPods, Macs, Apple Watch

When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. Cyber Monday is here, and there are lots of deals to choose from, including these excellent discounts on the Apple products we recommend: Today’s best Apple deals: U.S. Today’s best Apple deals: U.K. Updated December 1: We have reviewed the best prices and found more price drops and changes. We will be regularly monitoring the best prices and will update this article throughout Cyber Monday. ‘Tis the season for savings! Whether you’re looking for a deal on an iPad, Mac, iPhone, Apple Watch, AirPods, or anything else Apple sells, there’s no better time to get one for cheap than Black Friday. The annual shopping extravaganza officially kicked off on Friday, but many of the best deals will last until today, AKA Cyber Monday on December 1. Every retailer that sells Apple gear gets in on the fun, and we are rounding up only the best deals we find right here. We regularly check prices using various tools to get a view of the very best prices right now, compared to what they were over the past days, weeks, and months, so we know an excellent deal when we see it. We’re checking and updating these prices all weekend, so mark this page and return often so you don’t miss a good deal, some of which are short-lived. Even Apple runs its own Black Friday shopping event, where it offers gift cards on certain purchases, including $50 with AirPods Pro 3, $100 for iPad Air, and $250 with a MacBook Pro. The bottom line is that there are lots of deals to be found right now, so no matter what Apple device you’re looking for, you will be able to make a saving. So take a look at the deals on all of Apple’s products below. Also, check our Best Picks round-ups, where you can find reviews of all the products we recommend. At Macworld we’ve been covering and reviewing Apple and Apple devices for more than 40 years, from the original Macintosh to the most recent M5 MacBook Pro and iPhone 17 lineup. We use Apple products every day and purchase them with our own money, so we know a good deal when we see one. More importantly, we also know how to spot a bad deal. With a working knowledge of everything Apple sells and decades of experience, we know when stores are inflating prices or pushing “normal” sales as limited Black Friday deals, so the listings you see here will only be for discounts that are at or near all-time low prices. Macworld Cyber Monday tip: While shopping during the Black Friday sales, we’ve noticed that on Amazon, if you delay your delivery date, there are additional 2-3% savings to be had. This doesn’t apply to every Apple product, unfortunately, but we have seen the additional 3% applied to AirTags, and if you have lots of other eligible products in your shopping cart, then it can add up to decent savings. Apple released the new M5 MacBook Pro in October, but still sells M4 Pro and M4 Max models as well as the M4 MacBook Air. The new M5 model is mostly a chip refresh, but it’s a great one, as we said in our 4.5-star review, and right now you can get $250 off all the 14-inch M5 MacBook Pro at Amazon, taking it $50 lower than last Thursday and down to the lowest price we have seen. However, even though the new model brings a major boost in GPU and SSD performance, we also loved the M4 model, and you can get an amazing $300 off the M4 MacBook Pro at Amazon. There are also some excellent deals on the even more powerful MacBook Pro M4 Pro and M4 Max, which are full on workstations now at amazingly low prices, such as $300 off the 14-inch M4 Pro MacBook Pro at Amazon, and a whopping $500 off the 16-inch M4 Max MacBook Pro, also at Amazon. You can find more deals below. And, of course, the MacBook Air is a fantastic option for just about anyone, earning an extremely rare 5-star score in our testing. You can get $250 off the MacBook Air at Amazon. U.K. shoppers don’t miss out either, with £184 off a 13-inch MacBook Air at Amazon. £200 off the M5 MacBook Pro at KRCS, and £349 off the M4 Pro MacBook Pro at Amazon. See even more great deals below. Foundry U.S. U.K. The iMac and Mac mini received an M4 update in October 2024, with the Mac mini also getting a dramatic redesign that shrunk the case down to just 5 inches. We loved the new Mac mini design and M4 chip and there is $120 off at Amazon. The Mac mini M4 Pro version is a great low-cost way to get a really powerful Mac, and with $150 off it’s a good saving (but it was $200 earlier in the Black Friday sale). We don’t know when they will be getting M5 chips, but if they are, they won’t arrive until 2026, so we recommend picking up one of these deals if you’re looking for a Mac desktop. U.K. users should take advantage of £100 off the Mac mini, and £130 off the Mac mini pro. Simon Jary / Foundry U.S. U.K. Apple released the AirPods Pro 3 in September 2025, with a slightly new design, foam-infused eartips, and a heart-rate sensor. We gave them a near-perfect score in our review, but also noted that it’s a relatively small upgrade over the AirPods Pro 2, which has the same H2 chip and many similar features. The new model has the same $249 MSRP in the U.S. and a slightly lower £219 RRP in the U.K. (AirPods Pro 2 were £229), so keep that in mind when shopping. We don’t expect to see AirPods Pro 3 with more than $30-$50 off, but the older AirPods Pro 2 did dip as low as $139 at Walmart, but that deal seems to have ended now, the next best option is $189 on Amazon. The AirPods 4 have been out for over a year, but are still a fantastic pair of earbuds. The Black Friday deals of $69 for AirPods 4 was superb, but stock seems to have run out now (check to see if the model is user). You can still get AirPods 4 with active noise cancellation for less than $100, which is an excellent deal. If you need a pair, grab one, just beware that AirPods deals sell out quickly, but do keep checking because stock seems to come and go. See more U.S. AirPods deals below. U.K. readers can save money on the AirPods Pro 2, currently at £169 with Argos, but we’ve also seen them at that price on Amazon (but they go out of stock quickly!). Right now you can also get £20 off the AirPods 4, bringing the price under £100. See more U.K. AirPods deals below. Petter Ahrnstedt U.S. U.K. Mike Sawh Apple launched the Apple Watch Series 11 in September, but there aren’t many exclusive new features beyond better battery life and 5G networking. The two new health features, hypertension alerts and Sleep Score, are also available on the Series 10, and there isn’t a new color this year. As we noted in our review, we don’t think Series 9 or 10 users need to upgrade. We are seeing savings of $60 on the Series 11, which is a great price for such a full-featured watch, but with $150 off the Series 10 you might want to consider that, you won’t miss out on much (See our comparison of every Apple Watch). The sleeper hit of the new Apple Watch lineup is the SE 3, which got the biggest update of all three models, gaining an always-on display, temperature sensor, a faster chip, on-device Siri, and fast charging. We gave it a near-perfect score of 4.5 stars and highly recommend it at full price—for $50 off, it’s a no-brainer decision. At the high end, the Ultra 3 has a slightly larger screen, satellite connectivity, and longer battery life compared to last year’s model. We’ve seen $150 off, but if you want one, we’d recommend this $599 deal on the Ultra 2 instead. U.S. U.K. In the U.K. the deals are small on the newest Apple Watch models, but we anticipate that they will improve once Black Friday is here. And if they don’t our advice would be to snap up Apple’s offer, which will get you a £40 gift card. The biggest deals on offer right now are on the older models. We’d recommend Argos’s £200 off the Apple Watch Ultra 2 and Curry’s £130 off the Apple Watch Series 10. Just keep in mind that in the U.K., Apple cut the Apple Watch Series 11 and Ultra 3 prices by £30 and £50 compared to the previous generation when they were introduced. Keep this in mind when shopping, because some stores might make savings appear to be larger than they actually are. Apple updated the iPad Air with an M3 chip and the iPad Pro with an M5 chip this year. Neither update brings any huge reason to upgrade, but they’re both excellent tablets. It comes down to preference and budget—if you’re largely using your tablet for consumption (streaming, surfing, games), get an Air, for which we are seeing prices cut by $150, but if you have real work to do on it, get the Pro: you can get $100 off the M5 iPad Pro in the U.S. which is a great deal on such a new device. The mini hasn’t had a meaningful update in a couple of generations. But as we noted in our review, it’s still the best tablet for its size and a great option for anyone who values ultra portability over screen size. There’s a decent $100 off. The standard entry-level iPad A16 is an absolute steal at its Black Friday price of $275, but stock is dwindling, so if you want one act fast. Foundry U.S. U.K. We’re seeing a great £100 saving on the iPad Air, but the deals on the other iPads in the U.K. aren’t as big as they are in the U.S. The M5 iPad Pro only has a small saving, so right now we are looking at the older models to get a better discount. With that in mind, we’d recommend the M4 iPad Pro if you can find one (it’s £206 off at Amazon, but selling out fast). Apple has a great deal on for Black Friday that will run through to December 1, 2025. You can subscribe for six months for just $5.99/£4.99 a month! That’s half price! Read more here: Get Apple TV for just $6 per month. David Price / Foundry Most iPhone deals in the U.S. are through carriers and require a trade-in or adding a new line. Carriers will likely have enticing deals with trade-ins as well, but be wary of long-term contracts and terms. One opportunity worth considering is Apple’s Black Friday deal: You can buy an iPhone from Apple and get a gift voucher: In the U.K. there are less limitations on the sale of iPhones so you will be able to pick one up unlocked at a discount if you would prefer to buy an iPhone up front, rather than on a contract. Apple only launched the iPhone 17 lineup in September, so it’s a surprise that we are seeing £100 off the iPhone Air. The iPhone 16e also has £100 off at Amazon: a good saving. Also be on the look out for deals (like this one from AO) on the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max which are no longer sold by Apple but would offer a good option to those who appreciate the extra camera on the Pro iPhone models but can’t stretch to the iPhone 17 Pro. We’d suggest that when it comes to the other deals you should weigh them up against Apple’s own giveaway, where you could get £60 or £40 vouchers with the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, or iPhone 16e, respectively. For example, £100 off an iPhone 16e is better than Apple’s £40 voucher, but AO’s £55 off iPhone 16 (128GB) (which has run out now) doesn’t match Apple’s £60 voucher deal so it would be worth waiting to see it that goes lower. These are the best deals we’ve seen so far: There are lots more Apple products you can buy to go with your new Mac, iPhone, or iPad. Whether it’s a mouse and keyboard for your Mac, an Apple Pencil or keyboard cover to go with your iPad, charging cables and adapters, we are keeping track of everything so you can grab a discount this Cyber Monday. It’s a great time to grab a pack of AirTags, with prices dropping to $65 or £74 for a pack of four of Apple’s tracking devices. And we are seeing some nice price cuts on Apple Pencils (just make sure they work with your iPad first). The Apple Pencil Pro ($34 off/£20 off) is the newest model and is compatible with the iPad Pro, iPad Air, and iPad mini. Thiago Trevisan/Foundry U.S. U.K. If it doesn’t have to be AirPods, take a look at these deals on Apple owned subsidiary Beats. You might also find some deals among our best earbuds for iPhones and Best over-ear headphones. U.S. U.K. Apple holds a shopping event every Black Friday, but it doesn’t offer actual discounts. Instead, Apple gives away gift cards when you buy certain products, which can be used on a future purchase. In 2025, Apple is offering the following gift card values over Black Friday weekend: This years deal is better than last year’s, with a maximum of $250/£200 being given away in the form of gift vouchers, and in some cases, such as the iPhones, we are seeing better savings via Apple than elsewhere.

Just a few days ago, he spotted it on sale for $270, and it's not a competition, but Costco members can save an additional $20 on a special 96-oz version that includes two insulated cups with bubble tops. This compact machine makes drinks, keeps them frozen for 12 hours, and has easy machine-washable parts so nothing gets too sticky in between parties. Dyson Best Buy Amazon (V15 Detect) Amazon (V15 Detect Plus) Dyson The excellent Dyson V15 Detect is one of our favorite stick vacuums, and it's deeply discounted to just $500 at Costco, beating both Amazon and Best Buy by $50 while still including a suite of 10 accessories. The Detect naming comes from this vacuum's special trick, which analyzes the dust in front of it and adjusts your power to suit the mess. Is that a bit over-engineered for a stick vacuum? Maybe. But the results are hard to argue with, and it's one of our favorite Dyson vacuums for good reason. Apple Amazon (15-inch) Best Buy (13-inch) Apple Amazon (13-inch) If you're feeling more portable, you can also snag an Apple MacBook Air from Costco for just $750. It features similar specs to the Mac Mini above, with a 10-core M4 processor, 16GB of RAM, and a 256GB SSD. Reviewer Brenda Stolyar really liked this version of the machine, which pairs snappy performance with a smart screen and great battery life, and it's really only held back by limited ports and some heat management issues. Unlike the other sales, this one is only available until it sells out. Apple Amazon Best Buy Apple The compact Mac Mini from 2024 may be slightly dated, but it's still an excellent buy, especially with the Cyber Monday discount Costco has running, which brings the price down to just $480. It's fairly well equipped for its generation, with 16GB of memory, 256GB of SSD storage, and the 10-core Apple M4 processor, making it one of the least expensive devices with support for Apple Intelligence features. Sony Best Buy Walmart Amazon If you've been looking to upgrade your gaming setup ahead of those cold winter months, Costco has the Sony PlayStation 5 and an extra DualSense wireless controller for just $480. Considering the controllers run anywhere from $50-75 on their own, you're getting a noticeable discount on the console on top of being able to play with a friend. Bose Amazon B&H Bose They may be fresh on the market, but that won't stop Costco from knocking $50 off the Bose QuietComfort Ultra 2. WIRED writer Ryan Waniata recently got to spend some time with the sequel to one of our favorite noise-canceling headphones, and despite only minor upgrades, they still manage to improve the formula with new convenience features and the same great comfort and sound. Sonos Amazon Walmart The Sonos Arc Ultra is our favorite sound bar for standalone Dolby Atmos support, and Costco has it marked down to $880, just a dollar higher than Amazon's current price. Our reviewer Ryan Waniata was extremely impressed with the expansive soundstage, profound bass, and excellent clarity. It's also helped along by the updated mobile app, which has improved drastically over the last few iterations, and is particularly smart if you're already in the Sonos ecosystem.

When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. Cyber Monday is here, and there are lots of deals to choose from, including these excellent discounts on the Apple products we recommend: Today’s best Apple deals: U.S. Today’s best Apple deals: U.K. Updated December 1: We have reviewed the best prices and found more price drops and changes. We will be regularly monitoring the best prices and will update this article throughout Cyber Monday. ‘Tis the season for savings! Whether you’re looking for a deal on an iPad, Mac, iPhone, Apple Watch, AirPods, or anything else Apple sells, there’s no better time to get one for cheap than Black Friday. The annual shopping extravaganza officially kicked off on Friday, but many of the best deals will last until today, AKA Cyber Monday on December 1. Every retailer that sells Apple gear gets in on the fun, and we are rounding up only the best deals we find right here. We regularly check prices using various tools to get a view of the very best prices right now, compared to what they were over the past days, weeks, and months, so we know an excellent deal when we see it. We’re checking and updating these prices all weekend, so mark this page and return often so you don’t miss a good deal, some of which are short-lived. Even Apple runs its own Black Friday shopping event, where it offers gift cards on certain purchases, including $50 with AirPods Pro 3, $100 for iPad Air, and $250 with a MacBook Pro. The bottom line is that there are lots of deals to be found right now, so no matter what Apple device you’re looking for, you will be able to make a saving. So take a look at the deals on all of Apple’s products below. Also, check our Best Picks round-ups, where you can find reviews of all the products we recommend. At Macworld we’ve been covering and reviewing Apple and Apple devices for more than 40 years, from the original Macintosh to the most recent M5 MacBook Pro and iPhone 17 lineup. We use Apple products every day and purchase them with our own money, so we know a good deal when we see one. More importantly, we also know how to spot a bad deal. With a working knowledge of everything Apple sells and decades of experience, we know when stores are inflating prices or pushing “normal” sales as limited Black Friday deals, so the listings you see here will only be for discounts that are at or near all-time low prices. Macworld Cyber Monday tip: While shopping during the Black Friday sales, we’ve noticed that on Amazon, if you delay your delivery date, there are additional 2-3% savings to be had. This doesn’t apply to every Apple product, unfortunately, but we have seen the additional 3% applied to AirTags, and if you have lots of other eligible products in your shopping cart, then it can add up to decent savings. Apple released the new M5 MacBook Pro in October, but still sells M4 Pro and M4 Max models as well as the M4 MacBook Air. The new M5 model is mostly a chip refresh, but it’s a great one, as we said in our 4.5-star review, and right now you can get $250 off all the 14-inch M5 MacBook Pro at Amazon, taking it $50 lower than last Thursday and down to the lowest price we have seen. However, even though the new model brings a major boost in GPU and SSD performance, we also loved the M4 model, and you can get an amazing $300 off the M4 MacBook Pro at Amazon. There are also some excellent deals on the even more powerful MacBook Pro M4 Pro and M4 Max, which are full on workstations now at amazingly low prices, such as $300 off the 14-inch M4 Pro MacBook Pro at Amazon, and a whopping $500 off the 16-inch M4 Max MacBook Pro, also at Amazon. You can find more deals below. And, of course, the MacBook Air is a fantastic option for just about anyone, earning an extremely rare 5-star score in our testing. You can get $250 off the MacBook Air at Amazon. U.K. shoppers don’t miss out either, with £184 off a 13-inch MacBook Air at Amazon. £200 off the M5 MacBook Pro at KRCS, and £349 off the M4 Pro MacBook Pro at Amazon. See even more great deals below. Foundry U.S. U.K. The iMac and Mac mini received an M4 update in October 2024, with the Mac mini also getting a dramatic redesign that shrunk the case down to just 5 inches. We loved the new Mac mini design and M4 chip and there is $120 off at Amazon. The Mac mini M4 Pro version is a great low-cost way to get a really powerful Mac, and with $150 off it’s a good saving (but it was $200 earlier in the Black Friday sale). We don’t know when they will be getting M5 chips, but if they are, they won’t arrive until 2026, so we recommend picking up one of these deals if you’re looking for a Mac desktop. U.K. users should take advantage of £100 off the Mac mini, and £130 off the Mac mini pro. Simon Jary / Foundry U.S. U.K. Apple released the AirPods Pro 3 in September 2025, with a slightly new design, foam-infused eartips, and a heart-rate sensor. We gave them a near-perfect score in our review, but also noted that it’s a relatively small upgrade over the AirPods Pro 2, which has the same H2 chip and many similar features. The new model has the same $249 MSRP in the U.S. and a slightly lower £219 RRP in the U.K. (AirPods Pro 2 were £229), so keep that in mind when shopping. We don’t expect to see AirPods Pro 3 with more than $30-$50 off, but the older AirPods Pro 2 did dip as low as $139 at Walmart, but that deal seems to have ended now, the next best option is $189 on Amazon. The AirPods 4 have been out for over a year, but are still a fantastic pair of earbuds. The Black Friday deals of $69 for AirPods 4 was superb, but stock seems to have run out now (check to see if the model is user). You can still get AirPods 4 with active noise cancellation for less than $100, which is an excellent deal. If you need a pair, grab one, just beware that AirPods deals sell out quickly, but do keep checking because stock seems to come and go. See more U.S. AirPods deals below. U.K. readers can save money on the AirPods Pro 2, currently at £169 with Argos, but we’ve also seen them at that price on Amazon (but they go out of stock quickly!). Right now you can also get £20 off the AirPods 4, bringing the price under £100. See more U.K. AirPods deals below. Petter Ahrnstedt U.S. U.K. Mike Sawh Apple launched the Apple Watch Series 11 in September, but there aren’t many exclusive new features beyond better battery life and 5G networking. The two new health features, hypertension alerts and Sleep Score, are also available on the Series 10, and there isn’t a new color this year. As we noted in our review, we don’t think Series 9 or 10 users need to upgrade. We are seeing savings of $60 on the Series 11, which is a great price for such a full-featured watch, but with $150 off the Series 10 you might want to consider that, you won’t miss out on much (See our comparison of every Apple Watch). The sleeper hit of the new Apple Watch lineup is the SE 3, which got the biggest update of all three models, gaining an always-on display, temperature sensor, a faster chip, on-device Siri, and fast charging. We gave it a near-perfect score of 4.5 stars and highly recommend it at full price—for $50 off, it’s a no-brainer decision. At the high end, the Ultra 3 has a slightly larger screen, satellite connectivity, and longer battery life compared to last year’s model. We’ve seen $150 off, but if you want one, we’d recommend this $599 deal on the Ultra 2 instead. U.S. U.K. In the U.K. the deals are small on the newest Apple Watch models, but we anticipate that they will improve once Black Friday is here. And if they don’t our advice would be to snap up Apple’s offer, which will get you a £40 gift card. The biggest deals on offer right now are on the older models. We’d recommend Argos’s £200 off the Apple Watch Ultra 2 and Curry’s £130 off the Apple Watch Series 10. Just keep in mind that in the U.K., Apple cut the Apple Watch Series 11 and Ultra 3 prices by £30 and £50 compared to the previous generation when they were introduced. Keep this in mind when shopping, because some stores might make savings appear to be larger than they actually are. Apple updated the iPad Air with an M3 chip and the iPad Pro with an M5 chip this year. Neither update brings any huge reason to upgrade, but they’re both excellent tablets. It comes down to preference and budget—if you’re largely using your tablet for consumption (streaming, surfing, games), get an Air, for which we are seeing prices cut by $150, but if you have real work to do on it, get the Pro: you can get $100 off the M5 iPad Pro in the U.S. which is a great deal on such a new device. The mini hasn’t had a meaningful update in a couple of generations. But as we noted in our review, it’s still the best tablet for its size and a great option for anyone who values ultra portability over screen size. There’s a decent $100 off. The standard entry-level iPad A16 is an absolute steal at its Black Friday price of $275, but stock is dwindling, so if you want one act fast. Foundry U.S. U.K. We’re seeing a great £100 saving on the iPad Air, but the deals on the other iPads in the U.K. aren’t as big as they are in the U.S. The M5 iPad Pro only has a small saving, so right now we are looking at the older models to get a better discount. With that in mind, we’d recommend the M4 iPad Pro if you can find one (it’s £206 off at Amazon, but selling out fast). Apple has a great deal on for Black Friday that will run through to December 1, 2025. You can subscribe for six months for just $5.99/£4.99 a month! That’s half price! Read more here: Get Apple TV for just $6 per month. David Price / Foundry Most iPhone deals in the U.S. are through carriers and require a trade-in or adding a new line. Carriers will likely have enticing deals with trade-ins as well, but be wary of long-term contracts and terms. One opportunity worth considering is Apple’s Black Friday deal: You can buy an iPhone from Apple and get a gift voucher: In the U.K. there are less limitations on the sale of iPhones so you will be able to pick one up unlocked at a discount if you would prefer to buy an iPhone up front, rather than on a contract. Apple only launched the iPhone 17 lineup in September, so it’s a surprise that we are seeing £100 off the iPhone Air. The iPhone 16e also has £100 off at Amazon: a good saving. Also be on the look out for deals (like this one from AO) on the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max which are no longer sold by Apple but would offer a good option to those who appreciate the extra camera on the Pro iPhone models but can’t stretch to the iPhone 17 Pro. We’d suggest that when it comes to the other deals you should weigh them up against Apple’s own giveaway, where you could get £60 or £40 vouchers with the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, or iPhone 16e, respectively. For example, £100 off an iPhone 16e is better than Apple’s £40 voucher, but AO’s £55 off iPhone 16 (128GB) (which has run out now) doesn’t match Apple’s £60 voucher deal so it would be worth waiting to see it that goes lower. These are the best deals we’ve seen so far: There are lots more Apple products you can buy to go with your new Mac, iPhone, or iPad. Whether it’s a mouse and keyboard for your Mac, an Apple Pencil or keyboard cover to go with your iPad, charging cables and adapters, we are keeping track of everything so you can grab a discount this Cyber Monday. It’s a great time to grab a pack of AirTags, with prices dropping to $65 or £74 for a pack of four of Apple’s tracking devices. And we are seeing some nice price cuts on Apple Pencils (just make sure they work with your iPad first). The Apple Pencil Pro ($34 off/£20 off) is the newest model and is compatible with the iPad Pro, iPad Air, and iPad mini. Thiago Trevisan/Foundry U.S. U.K. If it doesn’t have to be AirPods, take a look at these deals on Apple owned subsidiary Beats. You might also find some deals among our best earbuds for iPhones and Best over-ear headphones. U.S. U.K. Apple holds a shopping event every Black Friday, but it doesn’t offer actual discounts. Instead, Apple gives away gift cards when you buy certain products, which can be used on a future purchase. In 2025, Apple is offering the following gift card values over Black Friday weekend: This years deal is better than last year’s, with a maximum of $250/£200 being given away in the form of gift vouchers, and in some cases, such as the iPhones, we are seeing better savings via Apple than elsewhere.
