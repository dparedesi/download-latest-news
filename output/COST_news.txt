Steak is sometimes thought of as a special treat, a fancy dinner, or simply out of reach. Since the price of steak has risen more than 40% since 2020, according to Visual Capitalist, that may seem like a safe assessment. But one reason prices are so high is simple supply and demand — people still want steak for dinner, special treat or not. But even though beef is increasingly in demand, U.S. cattle herds have diminished in size and drought has hurt supply — thus driving higher prices. The gold standard is to support your local farm or rancher. Buying from the source means reinvesting in growing herds, boosting supply, and ultimately, driving down costs. That said, if you're unable to source from your local farmer, there are a multitude of options at the grocery store. You can still snag quality steaks if you know where to look. The national average for steak in U.S. grocery stores is $12.26 per pound, but of course, this averages higher-end cuts like ribeye and strip with lower-end cuts like chuck and round and doesn't account for regional differences. So we did a deep dive and checked out prices across several popular grocery stores to find the cheapest cuts of steak. We looked at price per pound across each store's regional locations, factored each store's national average, and then compared them to see where you can get the cheapest cuts. Prices are as of the date of publication and may vary based on region. Aldi began as the world's first discount store and still remains one of the best places to find affordable items. So perhaps it's no surprise that Aldi comes in as the store with the cheapest cuts of steak when strictly comparing prices, though its prices are a little higher than the national average for U.S. supermarkets. The biggest drawback is that Aldi doesn't offer many steak cuts, so your options are fairly limited. But you'll find basic cuts like ribeye, strip, sirloin, round, and skirt, and if you think the lower prices are indicative of lower quality meat, you would be mistaken. We think these are some of the best steak cuts you can buy at Aldi. Take, for instance, the almighty ribeye, one of the most coveted pieces of meat. A little higher than the overall supermarket national average for ribeye (about $10), you can score this most scrumptious cut for about $13 per pound, which is the cheapest ribeye on our list. Likewise, Aldi offers the cheapest New York strip (but on par with Trader Joe's) for $14.44. However, if you're looking for cheaper cuts than those, Aldi also offers top round and eye of round for about $8, and we think that's a valuable find. Similar to Aldi, Trader Joe's revolutionized discount food shopping by offering customers lower prices on specialty brands and private-label products. Its unique offerings could be one of the reasons you tend to buy more than what's on your shopping list when you visit a Trader Joe's. It may not be as cheap as Aldi, but you can certainly find affordable items, including cuts of steak. But like Aldi, your steak options are somewhat limited. You'll pay more for ribeye at Trader Joe's — the national average for the chain is $15.49 per pound. This is a few dollars more than Aldi and about $5 over the national supermarket average. New York strip is about the same price as Aldi, between $14 and $15, but sirloin comes in about a dollar cheaper than Aldi, making it your best option for this cut. If you're looking for a fancier cut of steak, maybe for a truly special dinner, then you're in luck. Trader Joe's features some of the most affordable filet mignon at $21.99, which is pretty close to the national average for all supermarkets. Walmart is well-known for its giant Supercenters, which feature endless aisles of food and drink, plus sprawling produce and deli sections. The iconic store is also known for its low prices and wide range of products, including name brands and private labels. If we were choosing an overall best option for variety and reasonable prices, Walmart would come out on top. It's easy to find a cut that you can both afford and enjoy. But comparing price to price, you'll pay more for ribeye, strip, and sirloin than you would at Aldi or Trader Joe's. However, in relation to the other stores on our list, you'll get the best deal on skirt steak at just over $10 per pound, porterhouse for $13.47, and flank for about $12 — all of which are a couple of dollars over the national supermarket average. Walmart is one of the few stores on our list to offer the most steak choices — from upscale cuts like ribeye, strip, and porterhouse to tougher cuts like chuck and various cuts of round. You can even source Wagyu ribeye and strip at Walmart for just under $28 per pound. Costco has come under fire from customers for rising beef prices, though, as stated previously, prices have risen just about everywhere. But when you pay for a store membership in order to, hopefully, cut bottom-line costs, it's disappointing when prices are actually higher than at stores that don't require a membership. The membership fee itself only equates to between $5 to $10 per month (before tax), but what's the point if it doesn't save you money in the long run? You just might be better off shopping for steak elsewhere. But Costco sells in bulk, and that's an obvious benefit over smaller, non-wholesale grocery stores. Even though prices are increasing at Costco, you'll find some of the cheapest ribeye (after Aldi), as well as some of the most affordable top round, tri-tip, and flank steak. So if you have a Costco membership, no worries; there are still plenty of options to choose from while sticking to a tight budget. And if you feel like splurging on a special cut of beef, consider the filet mignon, which is the cheapest on our list at $19.99 — on par with the national supermarket average. Bonus: Get Costco ground beef in bulk during the holiday season if you're after high-quality beef. Sam's Club is another wholesale, membership-based grocer with fees ranging from a couple of bucks to $10 per month, depending on the level you choose. It's also one of the best supermarkets to find certain cuts of steak at incredibly affordable prices. Though you'll pay more at Sam's Club for cuts like ribeye and strip than you would at Walmart and Costco (about $3 to $6 per pound more for ribeye and $1 more for strip), you'll pay less for chuck and round. Sam's Club also offers skirt, flank, and tri-tip at excellent prices: about $11, $11.50, and $10.50 per pound, respectively. Though you may not be as familiar with these cuts as ribeye, strip, or chuck, this could be a good time to practice your cooking skills. Buying in bulk at low cost is a less risky way to learn how to make a restaurant-worthy tri-tip steak or master the best way to serve up skirt steak. And don't forget to impress your friends and family with a grilled balsamic flank steak at your next gathering. Cheap steak doesn't have to mean bland steak. Publix is a well-loved Southern supermarket chain that has earned its reputation as a shopper's delight with its commitment to fresh food, in-house butchery, and BOGO deals that turn higher prices into instant bargains. Of course, it's also loved for specialty items like its Supreme Cakes and fried chicken. When it comes to steak cuts, Publix lands somewhere in the middle with its prices and options. After Aldi and Trader Joe's, Publix offers some of the cheapest New York strip at about $17 per pound, which is on par with Costco and Walmart. But unlike Aldi and Trader Joe's, Publix has a wider range of cuts to choose from. You'll find cuts like porterhouse and T-bones for around $17, sirloin, flat iron, and tri-tip for between $14 and $15, and chuck and round for roughly between $12 and $13. However, Publix is known for its sales, especially around the holidays, when standing rib roasts are marked down to $6.99 per pound. But instead of roasting the entire piece of meat, you can slice it into individual cuts of steak, and voilà, you've got yourself some seriously cheap ribeye. Albertsons was founded in 1939 as a one-stop market that focused on offering quality items at competitive prices. Today, it has continued that legacy by stocking a wide array of steak cuts, from premium ribeye and strip to the more affordable chuck and round. Albertsons caters to budget-conscious shoppers by offering frequent promotions. While it may not undercut deep-discount rivals like Walmart or Costco with its everyday pricing, the chain holds its own with mid-price steak cuts. The fact that it offers such a wide range makes it a great choice for those looking for variety. Comparatively speaking, Albertsons has some of the cheapest porterhouse and T-bone steaks for between $12 and $14, more affordable than Kroger, Publix, or Whole Foods. It also offers up some of the cheapest flat iron and tri-tip at about $11 per pound, giving you more ways to expand your meaty expertise. These under-the-radar cuts open up opportunities to create dishes like herby grilled flat iron steak and smoky tri-tip tacos, keeping both your stomach and wallet happy. Kroger got its start as the pioneer of in-house grocery store bakeries in 1883, and eventually expanded to thousands of locations. It has a long history of competing with the biggest supermarkets in the U.S. and still offers low prices on everyday selections. However, it's not one of the cheapest stores on our list when it comes to steak. Kroger may not shine when it comes to inexpensive, higher-quality cuts. Ribeye, strip, filet mignon, and sirloin are priced pretty high, with ribeye and strip costing an average of more than $20 per pound — but it does stock a handful of other cuts that are much more reasonably priced. So though you may not be rushing to grab the ribeye, Kroger features top and bottom round and eye of round, with price ranging from $9 to $12. Kroger stocks flat iron, skirt, flank, and tri-tip for under $15, which is comparable to Sam's Club, Costco, and Albertsons. Whole Foods isn't really a supermarket that comes to mind when you're talking about cheap cuts of steak, but it lands on our list for offering customers some of the cheapest cuts of round. For under $10 per pound, you can get eye of round steaks or the entire round. Top round is about $12 while tri-tip and sirloin hover around $15 or $16. Like most grocery stores, ribeye and strip are on the higher end at over $20 per pound. Whole Foods is mostly known for its sky-high standards for sourcing. That makes it tough to compare its flat iron steak to the run-of-the-mill version found at discount stores like Walmart or Costco. That said, the chain occasionally drops deals on premium cuts, matching the lower prices seen at the other stores on our list. Amazon Prime members receive discounts on selected items, but these may vary. To research steak prices for some of the most popular grocery stores in the U.S., we assessed the prices of 17 different cuts of steak across nine stores. We gathered prices for each cut at each store using multiple locations. To determine each store's national average, we compiled data from every region (if the store was located there). It was interesting to note that each store was pretty consistent with its pricing of steak across its locations. That's to say that the ribeye at Aldi generally costs the same at its locations in Florida and Oregon. We pulled the prices for the national average price per pound for retail steak across all supermarkets using the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) 2024 National Beef Retail Report as a baseline. We also noted the various styles and grades available at each store on our list, which created a price range for many cuts.

Title: Despite some initial skepticism, could Target’s turnaround be right on target?

Jeffrey Sonnenfeld is the Lester Crown Professor in Management Practice and Senior Associate Dean at Yale School of Management. Steven Tian is the director of research at the Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute. The old proverb “new brooms sweep clean” is often misleadingly mentioned to suggest that new hires are more thorough. That drops the cautionary second part of the proverb that should not be ignored: “but an old broom knows the corners.” The wisdom of the full saying rings especially true when considering how the nascent turnaround effort at iconic retail chain Target appears to be coming into focus, despite widespread initial skepticism. While the path forward remains challenging, could Target’s turnaround be right on target despite all the naysayers? That skepticism apparently ran so deep, that merely two months ago, when Target announced that longtime, widely admired CEO Brian Cornell would be retiring and that 20-year company veteran Michael Fiddelke would take the reins, the stock immediately plummeted 8%, with sellside Wall Street analysts commenting that “investors were hopeful for an external hire,” and “this internal appointment does not remedy the problems of entrenched groupthink and inward-looking mindset.” (Target stock is down by more than one-third year-to-date.) Despite Fiddelke’s resume – having originally started at Target over two decades ago as an intern, and working in practically every job at the company across retail, merchandising, operations, finance, and supply chain since – many seemed to have written him off from the start, primarily by virtue of his insider status. But could that have been premature? It’s understandable that investors often have a knee-jerk preference for outsiders to parachute into companies in turbulent times. We acknowledge there is never any one-size-fits-all solution – there are always certain situations where an outsider may be genuinely necessary to shake things up and clear the deck. For example, Cornell himself came to Target from PepsiCo when Target was mired in crisis amidst a costly data breach and plummeting revenues, and he got Target back to growth within a couple of years. But our new, original analysis of recent Fortune 500 CEO successions suggests that surprisingly, internal CEOs have been consistently outperforming external CEOs, with dramatic outperformance in terms of total shareholder return (TSR). We analyzed all CEO transitions taking place in the Fortune 500, and we found that of the 61 CEO transitions which took place over the last year, the 39 CEOs who were elevated from within, have generated an average TSR of 14.81% on an annualized basis, while the 22 CEOs who were selected from the outside have generated an average TSR of -9.01% on an annualized basis. Could that be a one-year fluke? We ran the numbers over a longer-term period, and found that the same trend consistently held true. We found that of the 93 CEO transitions which took place over the last one to three years, the 71 internal CEOs have generated a 10.16% average annualized return, while the 22 external CEOs have generated a 6.35% average annualized return. Likewise, of the 84 CEO transitions in the Fortune 500 which took place over the last three to five years, the 70 internal CEOs have generated a 12.68% average annualized return while the 13 external CEOs have generated a 6.42% average annualized return. Simply put, the data is clear that no matter how you slice and dice it, there has been dramatic stock outperformance by internal CEOs vs. external CEOs when it comes to recent Fortune 500 CEO transitions. The conclusions drawn from our original analysis of recent CEO performance closely parallel the findings of other renowned management and corporate governance scholars. In his 2007 book, “The CEO Within,” Harvard Business School’s Joseph Bower found that externally recruited CEOs often lack the in-depth knowledge of the company’s culture and history needed to succeed. Similarly, Stanford’s David Larcker and Brian Tayan found that the data consistently shows across decades that internal CEOs outperform external CEOs. Many scholars have found the same conclusion holds true over more discrete time periods even beyond the ones we measured, such as during the COVID pandemic. While there is never a one-size-fits-all prescription that works in all cases, the data seems to suggest that the greatest change agent CEOs tend to come from within – internal CEOs tend to have a deep understanding of their company, what makes it tick, and even more importantly, where the bodies are buried, and what needs to change – and with the know-how, cultural savvy, and buy-in needed to make tough decisions on day one. As he retires, Brian Cornell has much to be proud of as one of the most admired and accomplished CEOs in retail. During his decade-plus tenure, he has transformed Target from a beleaguered company beset by crises when he arrived, into a retail powerhouse with over $100 billion of revenue today; successfully transitioned Target into an omnichannel retailer with significant e-commerce capabilities; reinvigorated the company’s lucrative, higher-margin private brand business to the tune of more than $30 billion a year in sales; and expanded the company’s geographic footprint to nearly 2,000 fully owned stores. And while the current stock price doesn’t reflect all these achievements, he has bought back billions in stock while raising the dividend every year during his tenure; all while continuing Target’s commitment to dedicating 5% of its total profits to communities, which it has done without break since 1946. Cornell’s prescient, industry-leading strategy to invest in stores in 2017 to build them into e-commerce fulfillment hubs paid off massively, enabling exponential e-commerce growth at Target, especially early on during the pandemic, with consumers embracing Target’s same-day home delivery and drive by pick-up service. This business, which was virtually built from scratch, now generates $20 billion a year and is still rapidly growing. Derived from Target’s burgeoning e-commerce platform is Target’s digital advertising business, which now generates $2 billion a year for the company and is still rapidly growing as well. At the same time, the complexity of running stores as distribution centers has created gaps in the store experience, and Target needs to provide consumers with a more premium, consistent shopping experience. Fiddelke will need to navigate a challenging road forward for Target, which has seen sales stagnate since peaking three years ago. Target has a higher mix of consumer discretionary products vis a vis competitors such as Walmart and Costco, whose product mix lean more towards consumer staples. This benefits Target when its merchandise is trend setting and differentiated, but can also be a headwind when consumers are stretched or managing budgets tightly. Fiddelke’s emphasis on restoring Target’s style authority may be the biggest factor in driving future growth here. Regardless, there is just no mistaking the magnitude of Target’s current challenges. To succeed, Fiddelke will need to put forward a comprehensive turnaround strategy as 2026 beckons, with the planned CEO transition looming in February 2026. Consumer spending is showing signs of slowing down amidst market share losses to key competitors, and Target will need to do a better job of both providing value to the financially stressed consumer; while also better differentiating its discretionary products to recapture higher spending consumers. Target needs to recapture its reputation for combining style, quality and value in a way other retailers don’t. There are some potential growth enhancers. While Target’s loyalty program, Target Circle, has over 100 million members; investors will be looking to see how Fiddelke can better leverage those memberships. Unlike Walmart or Amazon, Target Circle is free to join, and there is a big opportunity for Target to increase the offerings and value to attract more consumers while further monetizing the platform. Target has been testing different promotions, personalized offers, gamifying rewards, free gifts and working to increase awareness of the benefits, with a focus of driving upper-level paid premium memberships that come with 5% discounts on purchases and unlimited same-day home delivery. These initiatives have the potential to not only accelerate digital growth but also drive overall traffic and sales growth. Similarly, there is a significant opportunity for Target’s third-party marketplace business, Target+, which enables outside vendors to sell products on its website with attractive profit margins to Target, to grow significantly in the years ahead. Fiddelke appears to be meeting these challenges head-on. Virtually all observers agreed that the recent news of Target laying off 8% of its corporate workforce was difficult but necessary in rightsizing Target’s workforce. Analysts at Jefferies noted, “This is an early signal that Fiddelke is willing to make tough calls. The layoffs are essential to restore agility and cost discipline. If paired with initiatives to reignite traffic and improve digital execution, these actions could lay the groundwork for a turnaround”. These initial green shoots of progress have been warmly welcomed, with Target stock up nearly 10% over the last month. Furthermore, Target is continuing exclusive premiers with blockbuster talent like Taylor Swift, who just released her new “Life of Showgirl” album with exclusive related merchandize items available only at Target, continuing a highly profitable enviable relationship since 2008. But that marks only the start, and much more is needed. To sustain momentum, Target will need to communicate an even more sweeping, comprehensive turnaround strategy covering all aspects of Fiddelke’s new strategy in detail, perhaps around a potential investor day next spring. Clearly, there is strong appetite for bold, decisive moves, even if it means ripping off the band-aid right up front and working through some transitory pain. Then, from there, all eyes will be on execution. While our original analysis suggests that internal CEOs tend to have stronger track records of execution, the onus will be on Fiddelke to show that this leadership team of experienced Target veterans can hit the bulls-eye once Target’s target is in sight.

Title: ‘Do I need it?’ Groceries cost 20% to 40% more than before the pandemic. How San Diegans are making do

Mike Portal uses a no-fee credit card that gives 6% back on groceries. He pays it off every month. The chicken drumsticks in Chris Lovelace’s freezer cost 99 cents a pound, far cheaper than the red meat he used to buy. Margi Thornburgh, a night owl, checks ads and clips coupons every Wednesday at midnight and hunts for more discounts on store shelves. “I really get a thrill out of getting a bargain,” she said after spotting $1.99 smoothies at Vons recently, down from $3.99. Because they were half off, she bought 12 instead of six. “I was skipping out of the store with a big smile on my face.” These are some of San Diego’s super shoppers, who have been training for this era of fast rising grocery prices for decades. Some have the resources to turn frugal shopping into a sport of sorts — a car that lets them buy in bulk, time to shop for deals, storage space, multiple grocery stores close to home. For others, strapped for space or time, the path to eating adequately while not overspending is more challenging. Grocery prices have risen for a mix of reasons, including pandemic-era supply chain blockages and import tariffs that are passed on to shoppers. In San Diego County, food eaten outside of restaurants cost 4.4% more this July than a year earlier. That is the latest figure from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, whose publications stopped due to the federal shutdown. Fresher data — St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank’s nationwide FRED figures for September — show milk prices were up 10 cents a gallon over last year and up 68 cents over five years earlier, a rise of almost 20%. White bread was down 11 cents from last year but up 38 cents from five years earlier, about 25% higher. Ground beef cost $6.32 a pound, up from $5.67 a year ago and $4.08 in 2020. In the San Diego metro area, meat was 41% higher last month than in October 2019, dairy was 27% higher and produce was 18% higher, according to a grocery price index by Datasembly, a market analytics company that tracks prices of 1,000 products weekly across the United States. Local prices of meat and non-alcoholic beverages kept rising in the past six months, produce is almost even, and dairy and bakery items have fallen slightly, Datasembly found. Faced with these higher prices, San Diegans have changed how they plan and eat. They are abandoning foods and replacing stores they shopped at for decades with ones that have sales and coupons. They’re clinging to a few favorite items — Diet Coke, Diet Snapple, eggs and bourbon were mentioned. But they’re giving up a degree of control, opting to eat what’s on sale and not what they’re craving. They’re doing the math: if I spend this much on gas to drive around or spring for a freezer, but I save that much on food, is it worth it? As a teenager, Thornburgh learned to write grocery lists and shop weekly sales. Some 50 years later, she still uses those methods. But as local food prices have risen, outpacing the national inflation rate, Thornburgh has taken things further, combining every strategy she can think of so she doesn’t spend more than she must. “I look at all the ads either through the emails I receive or directly on the apps. I make my list by store of which items that I want to purchase. … I’m able to shop at multiple stores in one trip. I always bring a cooler to store cold and frozen items,” she outlined in an email to The San Diego Union-Tribune. Strolling through aisles, she keeps looking for deals. “I can be in a store, see an item on the shelf, and I will pull up the Target app, the Walmart app, the Food 4 Less app,” she said. “Any app of the store that I’m not in. And I will look for the price … and I will say, ‘Am I going to buy this here or am I going to go to another store?’” Her weekly grocery loop is time intensive, taking 90 minutes to two hours and covering as much as seven miles. Stops include Walmart, Food 4 less, Trader Joe’s and Vons. She recently folded in Aldi, drawn by an ad for 55-cent avocados. She picked those up, plus raspberries and asparagus, all on sale. Thornburgh, 70, gets income from contract sewing and Social Security. She is not among the 53% of adults who, according to a poll by AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, see grocery expenses as a “major source of stress.” (Groceries beat housing and health care costs and having inadequate savings or income as the top financial worry.) “I feel that I’m skilled enough and take advantage of all the tools out there,” she said. “I don’t feel stressed. But I’m very conscientious.” She reminds her husband: “If it’s not on sale, I’m not buying it. So he was really happy this week when Ding Dongs were on sale.” With these efforts, she spends around $100 a week, up from $60 before the pandemic, and saves around 50% on average at Vons and 40% at Food 4 Less. “With the money I save, it’s worth the investment of time,” she said. Thornburgh offered one more hint: don’t just shop online. Go inside stores. She acknowledged that shopping online and picking up groceries is convenient for some people, including parents of young children, but “you will miss the in-store sales, and sometimes those are substantial.” Jeff Lonsdale, Ken Sobel and Chris Lovelace are cutting back on red meat. “I don’t buy steaks anymore,” said Lonsdale, 68, who lives in a mobile retirement community in Oceanside. A half-package of sirloin burgers from Costco has been sitting in his freezer because he has “better, more affordable choices” today. He used to buy what he wanted, but as his income as a contract circuit designer fell and food prices hit new highs — especially for the beef burgers, steaks and pork chops he once enjoyed — he has changed his habits. “It used to be: I want it, I’ll go get it. Now I think, do I need it? Then maybe I go get it,” he said. “I don’t need doughnuts and cakes and desserts and that kind of thing, so I don’t even bother.” Currently, he said, “my income is short of expenses each month. My savings account keeps me above water.” Worried about cash flow, Lonsdale started tracking all food spending this year — both at stores and the occasional trip to Taco Bell. All together, his monthly spending on food is around $65 this year, he said. A food rescue program he visits three times a week helps him hold down costs, bringing surplus items from local grocery stores to his community. Around 40 people visit each time, he estimated. One recent morning, he picked up seafood salad with crackers, a 12-ounce watermelon cup, two mesquite-seasoned pork chops that totaled 12 ounces, an Earthbound Farms brand veggie tray with ranch dip, baby carrots, broccoli and celery, a Nathan’s hot dog and a 6-ounce Caesar salad. Based on the price tags he saw, he said the total might be around $20. “I mean, would you spend $3.99 for a little tray of cut up watermelon?” he said. “I get it for free and I’m loving it. And it’s not just the volume. It’s the variety. Things I have never thought about trying, never knew they had, wouldn’t have looked for.” Another nice surprise: goat cheese with herbs. “Wow, I’ll try that. It’s free. It was good.” Sobel, 71, who lives in La Jolla, cut out most meat and some other high-cost grocery items. “Sticker shock was a huge part of it — the prices that went higher all the time and the quality going down, almost commensurately,” he said. “That brought my focus back into buying only healthy foods, buying only what I’m going to eat, being careful about our choices.” After a hospitalization, Sobel decided to lose weight. He changed his diet in June and stopped buying “a lot of the high-price, mass-produced snack foods … that have skyrocketed in price.” One more change: “I really don’t throw away food anymore.” He makes a chef salad using turkey breast or sliced ham and eats that several days in a row, “until it’s completely gone.” “I’m lucky enough to be able to cut about 40% from my food budget and afford to eat,” added Sobel, who reduced his household’s average monthly grocery bill from around $550 (not counting the occasional restaurant delivery) before June to around $400 now. “But what about kids and seniors and low-income families who are losing their SNAP benefits?” Almost 400,000 San Diego County residents saw their CalFresh benefits — the state’s version of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) — halted Nov. 1 amid a federal government shutdown, now in its sixth week. Federal judges later ordered that funds be restarted. Between workers whose pay was frozen by the federal shutdown and people whose food benefits were postponed or trimmed, demand is surging at food banks and food-rescue nonprofits, whether in small communities like Lonsdale’s or at large distribution centers. In Encinitas, Lovelace rarely buys red meat at the store anymore. Instead, he goes out for quality burgers. “It’s got really, really good meat,” he said of Versailles Cafe’s $18 cheeseburger and fries. “It’s a real half pound, not a seven ouncer.” Lovelace’s rooftop solar on the house he and his wife, Dana, bought almost 50 years ago powers the two chest freezers he keeps in his garage. “I still don’t have any chicken breast in my freezer that I paid over $2 a pound for,” he said. Bacon was purchased at $4 a pound — around half of what it costs now full price. He is still working through the dozen packages of breakfast sausage he bought at half-off a while back. When he shops, he buys enough meat to last until the next big sale. Lovelace, who is 75 and retired, stopped shopping at stores that don’t send weekly ads. Like Thornburgh, he lives in a grocery-dense neighborhood with “all the big chains, so it’s really easy to get to places.” He focuses on house brands over pricier, name-brand versions. In-season food is also cheaper, he added. And he knows the market. “You have to know your prices. Sometimes that good deal really isn’t,” he said. These efforts are keeping the couple’s grocery costs almost even with last year: $560 a month in 2023 and 2024 and $577 this year, on average. “Doubtless expenses will begin to rise this holiday season as we liquidate our older inventories but we’ll still be kicking butt on money spent for food compared to any of my friends or neighbors when we compare notes on this topic,” Lovelace wrote in an email. He also credited his wife, who embraces his “cheapo philosophy.” In Mt. Helix, Portal is back to shopping like he did when he was a newlywed in the early 1990s — only now he has that cash-back credit card. “I was in the beginning of my career,” he said of his frugal youth. “We chose to have my wife stay home and take care of the babies. So, yeah, we pinched pennies and cut corners to save money.” Now his kids have kids and Portal, 65, has a home on Mt. Helix and a mortgage consulting business. But with the “tremendous increase in food costs” he has observed this year, he buys food on sale and stopped shopping at Whole Foods. “It’s just too high.” His small freezer holds berries bought on sale, which his toddler grandchildren devour. He also buys discounted meat and uses a vacuum sealer to avoid freezer burn. Ribeye on sale rose from $6 a pound to $9 or more, but even that is a relative bargain compared to full price, he said. Uncooked beef steaks cost on average $10.88 a pound last September and $12.26 this September, up from $8.13 five years ago, according to St. Louis Fed FRED data. To keep grocery expenses roughly the same as last year, even while springing for steak — and the chicken he cooks for RiRi, his 13-year-old Labrador pitbull mix — Portal and his wife stock up ahead of big holidays, when sales are “the best.” He gushed about his credit card, an American Express Blue Cash Everyday Card. Never carrying a balance is key, he said. Portal pointed value hunters to GTM Discount General Store, a surplus seller whose weekly sale recently featured 50% off Eddie Bauer sweatshirts, 40% off flood lightbulbs and 40% off spring wreaths. It has great deals on food, Portal added. Lovelace said he’s lucky to have two freezers and the garage shelves he built himself. “We have places to put stuff, and some people don’t. A lot of the things we do don’t apply across the board.” But his approach of stocking up when prices drop has worked across his lifetime. “In any given era, the same rule applies: prices on food have not gone down realistically over any real period of time in my lifetime. Little dips down and big jumps up,” he said.
