ByRon Schmelzer, Contributor. Generative AI is quietly becoming a first responder for holiday chaos. Every year someone forgets to thaw the turkey. Or realizes they’re missing nutmeg. Or discovers the mashed potatoes have turned gummy 10 minutes before guests arrive. Thanksgiving disasters are a tradition as ingrained as the cranberry sauce. The difference in 2025 is that many households are turning to AI as an emergency hotline for everything from last-minute menu pivots to oven triage. A 2025 YouGov survey summarized by Brookings reports that 56% of U.S. adults have used AI tools and 28% use them weekly for day-to-day tasks. Consumer studies show that 61% of adults have used AI in the past six months, with nearly 1 in 5 relying on it daily. Families have started using these tools for the same everyday tasks that once fell to harried hosts, including cooking, grocery lists and budgeting. Food preparation is one of the fastest-growing use cases. Research on “AI in the kitchen” suggests about 64% of consumers have already tapped AI for recipe ideas, meal planning or kitchen troubleshooting, according to a study by AskAttest. Rising costs are accelerating the trend. The American Farm Bureau estimates that the average Thanksgiving dinner for 10 now sits around $55.18, down slightly from last year but still well above pre-pandemic levels. Meanwhile, Bureau of Labor Statistics data shows year-over-year food-at-home prices up 2.7%, with meat and poultry costs rising even faster. Putting a holiday meal on the table now requires more planning, more math and more strategy. Overlay that with the chaos of hosting relatives, and the usual scatter-brained nature of planning complex multistep tasks in a compressed time environment, and it is no surprise that generative AI is emerging as a real-time rescue tool. Thanksgiving is more project management than cooking. It requires sequencing dozens of steps under time pressure while navigating unexpected problems. In past years, hosts turned to search engines, frantic group texts or a parent who “always knows what to do.” Search volume spikes each November for terms like “turkey won’t thaw,” “oven schedule Thanksgiving” and “how to fix lumpy gravy.” Today people are leaning on AI for rapid, contextualized judgment calls. AI tools are becoming the triage nurse for exactly these moments, stitching together advice, timelines, substitutions and rescue strategies in seconds. When using AI for Thanksgiving troubleshooting or disaster prevention, context matters even more than during calm planning. Start with a detailed briefing. A well-structured prompt can turn a looming disaster into a manageable adjustment. Here is a flexible prompt template you can use for this purpose: “You are my Thanksgiving kitchen triage assistant. Context: - Number of adults: - Number of kids: - Dietary needs or allergies: - Cooking skill level: - Available equipment (one oven, air fryer, Instant Pot, etc.): Current disaster or problem: [Describe the issue: turkey still frozen, missing an ingredient, side dish failed, running late] Constraints: - Time until guests arrive: - Budget flexibility: - Ingredients on hand: Goal: - Rescue plan with clear steps, backups and timing adjustments.” This level of detail lets AI deliver not just general advice but a survival plan tailored to your challenging kitchen needs. Even under normal conditions, AI can help you plan a menu with built-in safety nets. The trick is to design dishes that minimize points of failure. You can use AI to plan a menu based on risk tolerance. Tell AI if you have a tiny oven, no mixer or only one large pot. It will reshape the menu to avoid collisions that become disasters at 2 p.m. on Thursday. Likewise, if your table includes vegans, gluten-free diners and traditionalists, AI can help consolidate overlapping dishes so you avoid cooking three versions of everything. This reduces the odds of errors like cross-contamination or forgetting an essential side. For example: “Create a Thanksgiving menu for 10 that is low-risk and disaster-resistant. Requirements: - Only one oven. - Limited fridge space. - Beginner skill level. - Dishes should tolerate being made ahead, reheated or held warm.” AI will propose ideas with fewer temperature-sensitive steps, simpler techniques and more flexible ordering. A surprising number of Thanksgiving problems start at the store. Missing ingredients cause last-minute panic. Buying too much creates storage issues. Buying the wrong brand leads to consistency problems. And sometimes your most important ingredient is out of stock or unavailable. AI can step in here to help: “Turn these recipes into a consolidated shopping list. Group by store aisle. Flag ingredients that are easy to forget. Flag high-cost items where substitutions are possible. Identify items I should buy in duplicate to avoid emergencies. Help identify useful crisis prevention features such as: Highlight items prone to stockouts near the holiday and provide alternatives if they are not available Identify ingredients with large price swings Suggest pantry backups (like evaporated milk or broth) Build a 'Thanksgiving emergency kit’ of spices, foil, butter and broth” You can also ask AI to generate a cross-store comparison table so you can plug in prices from Aldi, Walmart, Costco or your local market. The LLMs themselves won’t have access to the most recent prices, however, so this will be a more challenging task. In the near future, expect the AI systems to have live connectors with current pricing so this should be a more trivial ask. The biggest disasters happen in the final three hours before the meal. AI thrives here. Make it your kitchen strategist, using this following prompt to help you get your act together: “You are my Thanksgiving day kitchen scheduler. Menu: [paste recipes] Dinner time: 5 p.m. Constraints: one oven, four burners, an air fryer. Tasks: 1) Build a timeline from 24 hrs before dinner to serving time. 2) Identify critical path steps. 3) Show when oven conflicts will occur and offer alternatives. 4) Suggest prep tasks that reduce chaos. Help me avoid the ‘everything needs 375 degrees F at once’ problem: Given these dishes and their preferred temperatures, create a single-oven plan that avoids temperature changes. Allow minor temperature compromises and note how they affect results.” If something goes wrong, AI can rescue you on the fly. Here are some AI quick-save prompt possibilities based on the disaster. Turkey still frozen at 10 a.m. (You know it needs to be thawed out well in advance, right?): “Act as a highly experienced home cook chef. Please help me with a critical problem I am facing.The turkey is still partially frozen. Dinner is in 6 hours. The turkey weighs 14 pounds. Give me safe, USDA-aligned rapid-thaw options and an adjusted cooking timeline.” Mashed potatoes too gluey? Try the following: “Help! You are my thanksgiving day triage assistant. My mashed potatoes turned gummy. Guests arrive in 30 minutes. Give me a fix using common ingredients.” Stuffing dried out? Try the following prompt: “Acting as a very experienced home cook chef capable of recovering any home cooking problem using commonly available ingredients and supplies.My stuffing is dry and crumbly. How can I rescue it without making it mushy?” AI cannot taste your food, but it can apply known kitchen chemistry and common approaches to rescue most dishes. Thanksgiving overspending is its own form of disaster. The PwC 2025 Holiday Outlook survey reports that about 84% of consumers expect to cut back spending over the next six months because of higher prices and a tougher economic outlook. The same PwC survey notes that 53% of consumers say price increases will likely affect their holiday spending decisions. AI supports budget recovery in several ways. First it can diagnose your menu’s cost centers by analyzing menus and ranking dishes by cost. AI can help suggest ways to reduce total cost by 20% without losing the holiday feel. It can also suggest alternatives for expensive items while maintaining flavor profiles. You still need to sanity-check allergy considerations, but it is a strong starting point. You can also use AI to build a budget strategy after something goes wrong. For example, if a dish burns or ingredients spoil, AI can propose fallback options that stay within your remaining budget. Post-Thanksgiving regret also often stems from having either way too many leftovers or not enough to make the weekend easy. AI can help build a leftovers plan that avoids both. For example, after providing some detail of your menu to an AI system, try the following prompt to help adjust cooking quantities: “Help me plan quantities for seven adults and three kids. We want leftovers for one additional meal only. Give recommended amounts for turkey, sides, and desserts.” Or you can use AI to creatively repurpose your cooking output. AI can reassign ingredients or repurpose partially saved dishes. “I burned half the stuffing. Here is what is left. Create a next-day meal plan using what survived.” Extra points if you provide a photo of the burned side and if AI can generate an image of what the rescued meal would look like. As we become more comfortable and familiar with AI, we all know that we can’t always trust AI outputs. AI can calm panic, but it also makes confident mistakes. Treat it like a smart assistant, not an authority. Always verify cooking temperatures. Use USDA guidelines to confirm poultry temps and resting times. Make sure to check allergy-related substitutions. AI can miss hidden allergens. Double-check any substitution involving nuts, dairy, gluten or soy. Be cautious with timing shortcuts. If a suggestion seems too good to be true, it probably is. Do not rely on AI to reduce safe cooking or cooling times. Just because the LLM confidently says something can be done on a specific time frame doesn’t mean it actually can. This is especially important for thawing, reheating and cooling food. When in doubt, consult USDA, FDA or your local extension office. AI has transitioned from a novelty to a true kitchen command center. It helps troubleshoot thawing issues, prevent oven collisions, salvage failed sides and can keep costs under control. Used well, it reduces stress and increases safety without replacing the heart of the holiday. So even if the turkey is still frozen on Thursday morning, the holiday can be saved, gracefully, safely and with your sanity intact.

Title: How Much Nostalgia Can an MMORPG Franchise Sustain?

Nostalgia can be a powerful influence on people. We all seem to have within us to desire to go back to some illusory “simpler time” when everything was better, more fun, less stressful, and didn’t cost so damn much. The problem is that only one of those items is consistently correct. That doesn’t stop businesses from preying on that desire to turn back the clock, though sometimes it is we, the customers, who end up banging on the door begging to be preyed upon. I think my earliest direct experience with this was Coca-Cola Classic. A registered trade mark of the Coca-Cola Corporation of Atlanta, Georgia Coke, having secured domination of the cola market, was now involved in the “cola wars” where Pepsi, pretender to the cola throne, was doing all it could to chip away and Coke’s market share. For some reason, Coke lost their minds and reformulated Coke to be more like Pepsi, thinking this would put Pepsi in it place. And so we got New Coke, which will live forever in business texts as an example of bad ideas. Coke, seeing their market share drop on the move, introduced Coca-Cola Classic. This set off a mild wave of nostalgia, as the company framed it that way, and we all ran to this new version of Coke and, for a brief time, Coke had even more market share with New Coke and Classic running in parallel. Then most people just picked Classic, sales of New Coke tanked, it was removed from the market, and we were back to just on core version of Coke. After that the company mostly ignore Pepsi and Pepsi scaled back their own costly assault on Coke somewhere around Crystal Pepsi and now we just have flavored versions of either as our variation. Not the last time I would see a nostalgia play, nor a nostalgia play that wore itself out as it simply became the new normal. In particular, for this discussion, there are MMORPGs that seem to rely pretty heavily on nostalgia after a certain point in their life cycle. EverQuest springs pretty readily to mind on that front. The game, coming up on its 27th year in a few months, took its first dip into the nostalgia pool 20 years ago, rolling out the first of what would become a long line of servers promising something akin to the first day experience. But it isn’t just the special servers that try to create a vision of the original. The expansions on the main servers… the “live” servers in EQ parlance, which translated to “retail” over in Azeroth… start to go back to old favorite locations in an attempt to capture a bit of that nostalgia magic. This same thing has been going on with World of Warcraft as well. In fact, Blizz was a little late to the party, taking 15 years to get there when titles that launched after WoW had been there already. But when Blizz finally got there, WoW Classic was a rousing success. It might even be considered a critical moment for the franchise as WoW Classic arrived just in time to save the game… financially at least… from the huge fumble that was the Shadowlands expansion on the retail side of the house. I am probably projecting my personal experience when I say Shadowlands broke the connection with retail for some… but the success of WoW Classic in that moment sealed it as a permanent fixture on the WoW agenda. The problem is that nostalgia is somewhat predicated on that past happy/better/ideal time being unavailable or unreachable. The whole point is that it is something in your personal story that you can no longer do. But what happens when that old experience is suddenly readily available again? What if you know that every spring the EQ team is going to roll out some minor variation on a fresh start, special rules, classic server. What happens when every expansion is going back to some old location? Or, on the WoW side of the street, what happens when you don’t understand that progress in old content is extremely accelerated so you let old expansions sit on the classic server long past their freshness date? What happens when your classic team’s monetization goals mean selling conveniences that were never in the original? What happens when you try to solve the “freshness” problem of old content by just cranking the difficulty dial one way or another while dumping modern features on top of the old content? And WHAT THE HELL happens when your retail team just gives up once and for all on being able to create two years of new content and decides that THEY TOO are going to spend the back stretch of every expansion cycle ALSO running old content, undermining the classic team’s efforts? You want Turtle WoW becoming a thing? This is how you get Turtle WoW becoming a thing! You make everything a blend of classic and suddenly it feels like a beige sameness. The spell is broken and people then want something new to try and reach that classic high. “New Classic” is an oxymoron, yes, but people are complicated and can hold conflicting beliefs. Sure, for a while there, I thought maybe Holly Longdale had unlocked the fountain of eternal youth with classic. But when classic content becomes pervasive, it is no longer classic. There can be no nostalgia when the old version is served up to you constantly… or, rather, nostalgia is defeated when things have changed so much… Dan Olson has a whole side riff on how much different it is to play WoW Classic on modern computers in his Why it’s Rude to Suck at WoW video… that you go there thinking you’ll feel the way you did, and it doesn’t happen. Or it no longer happens. For the first year or so of WoW Classic, it felt enough like the old days and Blizz hadn’t gotten concerned and started modernizing the old experience that I could squint my eyes and get a modest hit of “the good old days” from the game. But like all nostalgia, it is a very perishable product. I didn’t go play Anniversary Classic because it was too soon. The first time only worked because it had been so long since that original content had been playable outside of an emulator that is was great and there were crowds of people and we were all just so happy to be there. Until we weren’t. Now our group is off playing something else. We did WoW Classic and it was good, but even the most powerful nostalgia cannot fix what was broken in the first place. So it was an incredible high in vanilla, followed by a low in Outland… which I didn’t really like back in the day and was also the point when Blizz decided they really needed to monetize this classic stuff more… had a rebound in Northrend, and then died in the cataclysm, just like it did the first time around. I guess full points for recreating the original experience, but also I am no longer a subscriber. And EQ has it even worse. They’ve been putting out the special server thing for so long now that it is no longer special. There seems to be no setting of the dials that they have easy access to that will excite their installed base, and keeping them engaged is a critical part of their own business plan, a plan that wasn’t going so well at the last report, to the extent that EG7’s largest shareholder, Eros Capital Partners, has a list of demands including a new board of directors, more stock buybacks to bolster the share price, and maybe even bringing the whole place private again so they can loot the company without the watchful eye of regulators getting involved. What do you do when the nostalgia well runs dry? Yes, this is where we get to Classic Plus and like dreams. The problem is that the EverQuest team simply doesn’t have the bandwidth to work on a new content creation path for the company’s foundational title. And if things continue to decline for EQ, they are likely going to have to make do with an even smaller team. Meanwhile, the World of Warcraft team could almost certainly find the staff to do something along those lines. Season of Discovery proved they could change up at least some of the vanilla experience. But my outsider opinion, having watched them for so many years, is that there is no internal champion capable of driving such a project. They always had the public company problem when Bobby Kotick was running the show, but they now have that in spades with Phil and Satya so obviously willing to slash and burn the second their bonuses might be in jeopardy. This is where Old School RuneScape is the outlier. Jagex has had a horrible time trying to develop another title. It feels like RuneScape is all the magic they had in them. But when they too went to the nostalgia well, they somehow found it within themselves to create a new path forward, different from RuneScape’s, to follow. This again, however, points out the hollow nature of nostalgia as a business plan. People want to “feel” like they did back in the day, but in the attempt they often find that simply going back to a game in their current state of mind will not fulfill that need. In the end, even Old School RuneScape failed the nostalgia test in the end. In going back to that, the players who embraced the old style of play quickly settled in and it became normal. It was Coca-Cola Classic just becoming Coke for that group. To keep them engaged, there had to be more, a hook, something fresh to keep those players happy. Nostalgia is a gimmick. A tease. A hook to grab attention. But Nostalgia alone is not sustainable, in part because we have all moved on from those times. We are different people in a changed world and the context that made something great at one moment leaves it feeling hollow now. For my final example, just to seal the deal on that idea, I am going to fall back to the Atari 2600. As I wrote years back, I wanted that more than anything in the world back in 1977. And I played the hell out of that console once I had it. But it doesn’t interest me today despite whatever investment group that holds the Atari name tries to tempt me with. That is a console that has been beaten to death when it comes to nostalgia. The history of the 2600 these days is 6 years of success, and 22 years of trying to remind me how cool it was back in 1977. There has been no point in time since the mid-90s when I could not have bought a software version or a reworked, cost reduced, hardware copy of the original, to the point that I wonder who is left to even purchase such a thing. Then again, I suppose they wouldn’t keep remaking if nobody was buying them. But they always seem to show up around the holidays, when nostalgia is often at its peak and many adults are internally struggling with the fact that none of it is as much fun as when they were a kid. And then they see a stack of the latest round of 2600 remakes sitting on a pallet at Costco, and they cave to the temptation in their state of weakness. I mean, I know better and it almost works on me every year… almost. Yeah, I love that Dan Olsen video. His comment about going back and betting on the Cubs in 2016 and smashing in high school when you had the chance as a way to relive your past really hits home, because it also highlights just how far away that I am from my own high school experience for 2016 to be about my kids’ high school experience. (If my kids did smash when they got the chance back in high school, I think I’m happy with not knowing.) Still, Dan was right in that you really can’t go home again, and my form of rebellion in Wrath Classic was to simply refuse to get on the treadmill and do all the things I never got to do back in 2009-2010. I suppose in my own way I was deliberately choosing to suck at Warcraft as a big middle finger to the Classic Community. As far as the Atari (and other classic 8-bit systems) goes, I still have a working console in the basement, along with an Intellivision. (I have NO idea if the TI-99 4/A still works, as I haven’t powered it on in 30 years, but it probably does.) The one thing that keeps me from playing them is adapting them to fit a modern television. I’ve done some investigations from time to time, but the solutions commonly found on Amazon don’t exactly thrill me (I don’t trust the companies behind them when I can’t find any information about them online.) I may have to build something myself, or at the very least degauss the RCA CRT television we still have loitering around to get it up and running. LikeLike My strange variant on this is that the older I get, the less interested in revisiting my past I become but the more interested I am in anything that feels genuinely new. It gets harder and harder to find anything in just about any medium to which my immediate, unfiltered reaction isn’t “Oh, that reminds me of…” or even worse “Oh, that’s exactly like…”. I do still get a buzz out of revisiting old things but nowadays even that usually means old things I missed when they were new. New-to-me is the baseline of what makes me excited now. That’s why I’m a lot more interested in the upcoming EQII expansion, even though it will really just be more of the same, than I will be in whatever retro-server they try to drum up fading interest for next summer. At least the expansion will look new, even if it plays exactly the same. I do think Darkpaw is about done with the TLE server trick, though. They’ve made it last way longer than it had any right to so they can hardly complain but it can’t go on forever. EG7/DBG really need to come up with a new idea for the EQ IP soon, even if a whole new game is beyond them at this point. Maybe AI will save them… LikeLike (Re-posting this comment because the first just vanished. Please delete as necessary!) My strange variant on this is that the older I get, the less interested in revisiting my past I become but the more interested I am in anything that feels genuinely new.

Maybe AI will save them… LikeLike I truly delighted in WoW the first time around. it was all new to me, it was progress, it was definitely Wow. By the time they began messing with it, the game had shifted, and you were no longer in control of where you could go; the fights were easier, or non existent, and your trips ‘back home’ were stunningly sad. There was no back home. The story line changed, and the challenges that went with discovery the first time were now yawn inducing ‘oh yeah, I remember this” events. This, to me, is where WoW failed. It told the truth. You can’t go home again, because someone else lives there, the neighbors are gone, and that neat tree in the backyard has been replaced with a horse stall. Even when you know (or think you do) what’s around the bend, you’re braced for one event, only to face a different one. No more challenges. LikeLike I would really like a can of Crystal Pepsi for nostalgia’s sake, now that you’ve reminded me. The sensation I had when I tried it for the first (and, I believe only) time was very fascinating. My brain was like “Aaaaaahhhh, it looks like soda, but smells and tastes like Pepsi, what the hell is going on???” Of course, as with almost all kinds of nostalgia, that, too, would probably get old pretty fast. LikeLike I am far from immune to nostalgia, but the surprising thing to me about WoW Classic was how actually good a game it was back then. Rough edges, sure, but mostly quibbles. Nostalgia brought me to the party, the quality kept me there. But one can only play a given game so much before anything gets old. I hope for their sake they aren’t shifting the same diminishing player base around but actually bringing some new blood still. No amount of remixing will help if that isn’t the case. LikeLike I used to get frustrated with revisiting things because nothing ever seemed right or fun until I realized that it was me. I came to the conclusion that nostalgia is just me wanting to be a tourist among my past memories. That trying to live in the past is just going to be a disappointment/disaster. Once I understood that about myself I found I could have fun with nostalgic things. As far as gaming nostalgia goes, while I never played EQ (or EQ 2) in any serious fashion it has been fun to talk to and read people’s reactions about the progression servers. I get a sense that having a steady stream of them works well because there is enough people that like to drop in and experience the way things were for a time. After they get their fill they generally move on and and a new casual group starts up with the next server. With Wow I’m waiting until they feel the need to have a Chromie time version of Classic available for leveling in Retail. They’ve made a few steps towards making things from Classic available again in Retail, but that deep, rich vein of making all of Classic doable with Retail systems is waiting for them to break the glass. LikeLike Nostalgia is brain poison for old people. I have very fond memories of the blizzard of (Jan) 1996, of doing snow angels in the snow in front of the apartment bldg with my new wife. Great memory, full of joy. Good times, right? But I also remember that back then we were pretty poor, recently out of college, with debt and living in the cheapest neighborhood we could find. I have a very unpleasant memory of sitting down one time with $4.75, all we had, and budgeting it out to last three days til payday. Right down to how many subway tokens we needed and what ramen and cans of food we could get at the bodega. The walk to the train was so dicey at night I’d walk my wife there (night shift) and then go home and collapse into bed (day shift for me). In other words, it actually kind of sucked back then. I watched Halloween a few years ago and couldn’t believe how bad it was. It was one of my favorite movies when I was young. The acting, especially the dialogue, is so bad it sounds like a fourth grade play. If it wasn’t for the fame and “nostalgia” it would be unwatchable. I went to one of those arcade-bars a few years ago. So cool, you can play all these games while having access to the bar! And now I’m older, so I can afford to play any game(s) I want! You can guess what happened. You play Space Invaders, Asteroids, etc., a few times, and realize they’re kind of primitive and boring and only good for a day full of fun if current technology presents nothing better and you’re a kid with less options than an adult. The entire array of games held my attention for about 30 minutes and then it was just another bar. Brain poison. LikeLike “The history of the 2600 these days is 6 years of success, and 22 years of trying to remind me how cool it was back in 1977.” Oh, yes. As far as MMO nostalgia goes, you can go back to the old content, but you can’t go back to the you that had no idea what was going on. LikeLike In a real sense it’s like rereading a book, or rewatching an old film or TV show. I can never be the young me discovering Tolkien for the first time. I can still read LotR as the much older me because I find ways of still enjoying it. Like I can play *insert old game* quite merrily, but I approach it very differently now to then. To get value now I have to remember I’m in the back half of my forties. As Tips says, you can’t go back to the old you; but as Pallais says you can (or I can) sometimes frame things that accounts for that and allows one to enjoy the nostalgia. LikeLike That is a distinction I could have made more clear, because the other direction, the “everything old is bad, newer is always better” idea is flawed in its own way. A lifetime in Silicon Valley has proven that. I still play a lot of older games because they were good. WoW Classic was a lot of fun as a game, even absent the nostalgia aspect. There is probably a whole post to be written (again) about how expansions are an attempt to keep the party going that can wear things thin while stealing fun from the original.

Apple released the new M5 MacBook Pro in October, but still sells M4 Pro and M4 Max models as well as the M4 MacBook Air. The new M5 model is mostly a chip refresh, but it’s a great one, as we said in our 4.5-star review, and right now you can get $200 off all the 14-inch M5 MacBook Pro at Amazon, taking it to the lowest price we have seen. However, even though the new model brings a major boost in GPU and SSD performance, we also loved the M4 model, and you can get an amazing $300 off the M4 MacBook Pro at Amazon. There are also some excellent deals on the even more powerful MacBook Pro M4 Pro and M4 Max, which are full on workstations now at amazingly low prices, such as $300 off the 14-inch M4 Pro MacBook Pro at Amazon, and a whopping $500 off the 16-inch M4 Max MacBook Pro, also at Amazon. You can find more deals below. And, of course, the MacBook Air is a fantastic option for just about anyone, earning an extremely rare 5-star score in our testing. You can get $250 off the MacBook Air at Amazon. U.K. shoppers don’t miss out either, with £184 off a 13-inch MacBook Air at Amazon. £200 off the M5 MacBook Pro at KRCS, and £349 off the M4 Pro MacBook Pro at Amazon. See even more great deals below. Foundry U.S. U.K. The iMac and Mac mini received an M4 update in October 2024, with the Mac mini also getting a dramatic redesign that shrunk the case down to just 5 inches. We loved the new Mac mini design and M4 chip and there is $120 off at Amazon. The Mac mini M4 Pro version is a great low-cost way to get a really powerful Mac, and with $200 off it’s a superb saving. We don’t know when they will be getting M5 chips, but if they are, they won’t arrive until 2026, so we recommend picking up one of these deals if you’re looking for a Mac desktop. U.K. users should take advantage of £100 off the Mac mini, and £130 off the Mac mini pro. Simon Jary / Foundry U.S. U.K. Apple released the AirPods Pro 3 in September 2025, with a slightly new design, foam-infused eartips, and a heart-rate sensor. We gave them a near-perfect score in our review, but also noted that it’s a relatively small upgrade over the AirPods Pro 2, which has the same H2 chip and many similar features. The new model has the same $249 MSRP in the U.S. and a slightly lower £219 RRP in the U.K. (AirPods Pro 2 were £229), so keep that in mind when shopping. We don’t expect to see AirPods Pro 3 with more than $30-$50 off, but the older AirPods Pro 2 have dipped as low as $139 at Walmart. That’s a hard deal to pass up. The AirPods 4 have been out for over a year, but are still a fantastic pair of earbuds. The Black Friday deals of $69 for AirPods 4 and $100 AirPods 4 with active noise cancellation are simply mind-blowing. If you need a pair, grab one, just beware that those deals can sell out quickly, but do keep checking because stock seems to come and go. See more U.S. AirPods deals below. U.K. readers should keep an eye on Amazon for price drops on the AirPods Pro 2, which were out of stock (and only showing used models) when we checked, but we’ve seen stock come and go and expect to see again the £169 price for new models we have seen twice in November already. Right now you can also get £20 off the AirPods 4, bringing the price under £100. See more U.K. AirPods deals below. Petter Ahrnstedt U.S. U.K. Mike Sawh Apple launched the Apple Watch Series 11 in September, but there aren’t many exclusive new features beyond better battery life and 5G networking. The two new health features, hypertension alerts and Sleep Score, are also available on the Series 10, and there isn’t a new color this year. As we noted in our review, we don’t think Series 9 or 10 users need to upgrade. We are seeing savings of $60 on the Series 11, which is a great price for such a full-featured watch, but with $150 off the Series 10 you might want to consider that, you won’t miss out on much (See our comparison of every Apple Watch). The sleeper hit of the new Apple Watch lineup is the SE 3, which got the biggest update of all three models, gaining an always-on display, temperature sensor, a faster chip, on-device Siri, and fast charging. We gave it a near-perfect score of 4.5 stars and highly recommend it at full price—for $50 off, it’s a no-brainer decision. At the high end, the Ultra 3 has a slightly larger screen, satellite connectivity, and longer battery life compared to last year’s model. We’re looking for at least $50 off, but if you want one, we’d recommend this $599 deal on the Ultra 2 instead. U.S. U.K. In the U.K. the deals are small on the newest Apple Watch models, but we anticipate that they will improve once Black Friday is here. And if they don’t our advice would be to snap up Apple’s offer, which will get you a £40 gift card. The biggest deals on offer right now are on the older models. We’d recommend Argos’s £200 off the Apple Watch Ultra 2 and Curry’s £130 off the Apple Watch Series 10. Just keep in mind that in the U.K., Apple cut the Apple Watch Series 11 and Ultra 3 prices by £30 and £50 compared to the previous generation when they were introduced. Keep this in mind when shopping, because some stores might make savings appear to be larger than they actually are. Apple updated the iPad Air with an M3 chip and the iPad Pro with an M5 chip this year. Neither update brings any huge reason to upgrade, but they’re both excellent tablets. It comes down to preference and budget—if you’re largely using your tablet for consumption (streaming, surfing, games), get an Air, for which we are seeing prices cut by $150, but if you have real work to do on it, get the Pro: you can get $100 off the M5 iPad Pro in the U.S. which is a great deal on such a new device. The mini hasn’t had a meaningful update in a couple of generations. But as we noted in our review, it’s still the best tablet for its size and a great option for anyone who values ultra portability over screen size. There’s a decent $100 off. Finally, the standard entry-level iPad is the bare-bones option in Apple’s lineup, but it still has a great screen, a capable processor, and great battery life. It’s great for kids and an absolute steal at its Black Friday price of $279. Foundry U.S. U.K. We’re seeing a great £100 saving on the iPad Air, but the deals on the other iPads in the U.K. aren’t as big as they are in the U.S. The M5 iPad Pro only has a small saving, so right now we are looking at the older models to get a better discount. With that in mind, we’d recommend the M4 iPad Pro if you can find one (it’s £206 off at Amazon, but selling out fast). Apple has a great deal on for Black Friday that will run through to December 1, 2025. You can subscribe for six months for just $5.99/£4.99 a month! That’s half price! Read more here: Get Apple TV for just $6 per month. David Price / Foundry Most iPhone deals in the U.S. are through carriers and require a trade-in or adding a new line. Carriers will likely have enticing deals with trade-ins as well, but be wary of long-term contracts and terms. One opportunity worth considering is Apple’s Black Friday deal: You can buy an iPhone from Apple and get a gift voucher: In the U.K. there are less limitations on the sale of iPhones so you will be able to pick one up unlocked at a discount if you would prefer to buy an iPhone up front, rather than on a contract. Apple only launched the iPhone 17 lineup in September, so it’s a surprise that we are seeing £100 off the iPhone Air. The iPhone 16e also has £100 off at Amazon: a good saving. Also be on the look out for deals (like this one from AO) on the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max which are no longer sold by Apple but would offer a good option to those who appreciate the extra camera on the Pro iPhone models but can’t stretch to the iPhone 17 Pro. We’d suggest that when it comes to the other deals you should weigh them up against Apple’s own giveaway, where you could get £60 or £40 vouchers with the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, or iPhone 16e, respectively. For example, £100 off an iPhone 16e is better than Apple’s £40 voucher, but AO’s £55 off iPhone 16 (128GB) doesn’t match Apple’s £60 voucher deal so it would be worth waiting to see it that goes lower. These are the best deals we’ve seen so far: There are lots more Apple products you can buy to go with your new Mac, iPhone, or iPad. Whether it’s a mouse and keyboard for your Mac, an Apple Pencil or keyboard cover to go with your iPad, charging cables and adapters, we are keeping track of everything so you can grab a discount this Black Friday. It’s a great time to grab a pack of AirTags, with prices dropping to $65 or $74 for a pack of four of Apple’s tracking devices. And we are seeing some nice price cuts on Apple Pencils (just make sure they work with your iPad first). The Apple Pencil Pro ($34 / $20 off) is the newest model and is compatible with the iPad Pro, iPad Air, and iPad mini. Thiago Trevisan/Foundry U.S. U.K. If it doesn’t have to be AirPods, take a look at these deals on Apple owned subsidiary Beats. You might also find some deals among our best earbuds for iPhones and Best over-ear headphones. U.S. U.K. Apple holds a shopping event every Black Friday, but it doesn’t offer actual discounts. Instead, Apple gives away gift cards when you buy certain products, which can be used on a future purchase. In 2025, Apple is offering the following gift card values over Black Friday weekend: This years deal is better than last year’s, with a maximum of $250/£200 being given away in the form of gift vouchers, and in some cases, such as the iPhones, we are seeing better savings via Apple than elsewhere.

Title: 7 Grocery Store Chains With The Best Steaks, According To Shoppers
URL: https://www.tastingtable.com/2031019/best-grocery-stores-buy-steak/
Time Published: 2025-11-26T01:20:00Z
Full Content:
Beef prices are going up. Per recent reporting from Fox Business, industry leaders anticipate a top cost of $10 per pound by 2026. Yet, people's craving and appreciation for steak isn't going anywhere. Rather than heading out to a steakhouse (where business is, admittedly, also booming), many consumers are looking to their local grocery stores for steaks to prepare at home. It's easy to walk into a grocery store and find a full list of different cuts of steak, but what's less straightforward is assessing quality while shopping. Truth be told, some grocery stores are better to buy steak from than others. When compiling this guide to steak quality by grocery chains, we identified the in-house steaks brands each grocery chain sources and sells as private label items. Beef or meat brands with larger footprints (take Tyson, for example) didn't factor in very heavily. We also took into consideration whether or not a chain has significant offerings from local or small-scale beef producers as well. Mostly, this guide centers on how shoppers feel about these private label steaks from popular grocery chains. Kicking off our list of best grocery store steak selections is the one and only: Kroger. Synonymous with Midwestern groceries, Kroger is the go-to store for a large portion of the American population. Luckily, it's also home to one of the highest-quality lines of steak from any grocery chain — the Kroger Simple Truth and Simple Truth Organic line. Simple Truth, one of the store's private labels, uses beef sourced from Uruguay, which has a more favorable climate for grass-fed and finished cows to graze on year-round. With Simple Truth, the livestock has a diet that is almost exclusively grass. Kroger refrains from using beef where hormones or antibiotics have been administered, resulting in natural meat without sacrificing flavor. In Uruguay, much of the cattle are Aberdeen Angus or Hereford cows. The latter is a hardy breed, while the former is known for superior marbling. You can widely see the difference in the quality of product Kroger sells. Although the reviews on its in-house branded steaks are mixed depending on the store, the Private Selection is reviewed well across the board, reaching at least three and a half stars on each steak (with many rated between four and five stars). The chain offers a variety of different cuts, including choice beef shoulder steak, top round London broil beef steak, beef choice skirt steak, sirloin tip beef, choice tailless beef strip steak, T-bone steak, eye of round beef steak, and cubed beef steak. It may not be the very best steak available in grocery stores, but it's well above most others and is deserving of a try next time you find yourself in one of the many Kroger locations. Trader Joe's, known for its eclectic inventory and cheap pricing, is also home to some of the best-quality steaks you'll find in grocery stores. Although the cuts Trader Joe's has carried have always contained a solid amount of USDA Choice graded slabs, it has updated its selection to be even better. As of 2025, its stock has been updated to include filet mignon, ribeye, and New York strip steaks (all of which are graded as the second-highest grade for meat possible: Choice). The store also offers selections between pure pre-packaged cuts, organic grass-fed angus, and pre-marinated cuts (including, but not limited to, craft beer sirloin, carne asada, balsamic rosemary, and sesame teriyaki). It give the meat selection a versatility no matter what the meal you're making, with options that can fit many styles of cooking. While it may not have quite as high a quality as a store like Costco (which has its own processing and packaging process), for the value and size of steaks that Trader Joe's offers, it's one of the best deals on steak in any grocery store. According to shoppers, the lean tenderness of filet mignon and craft beer sirloin are the best options, as they both have solid five-star reviews. Shoppers in the Reddit group r/traderjoes agree that the store's steak is better than most other grocers. While steak may not be the first thing you think of when hearing of Trader Joe's, it should absolutely be one of the first things you put in your cart on your next visit. Publix grocery store (found primarily in the southeast) makes a comittment to supporting local farmers, and regularly procures meat from regional ranches. Sources are found from beef purveyors like Prestage Farm of North Carolina, and White Oak Pastures in Bluffton, Georgia. Nationally, it receives beef from Verde Farms, a regenerative farming-focused operation, which emphasizes environmental preservation and humane treatment of livestock. The store's meat counters are regularly stocked with a multitude of USDA Choice-graded cuts. The quality comes through in the house brand, GreenWise private label, and the line of meat sold under it. The animals raised for the GreenWise program are fed exclusively vegetarian diets, with no added hormones or antibiotics, resulting in more succulent meats packed with flavor. This, in large part, is due to its local sourcing, as Although the brand sells a variety of meats, including different kinds and variations of chicken, turkey, pork, and lamb, the steak is the clear standout, as its flavor is consistently second-to-none. While the store's website doesn't offer customer reviews for its particular products, the Reddit group r/publix concurs that the steak is of better quality than similar stores, and the store itself largely receives high ratings on Yelp. While Costco is generally known as a place to get bulk items for much cheaper prices, it has some departments that stand out for consistently having quality items (such as whiskies) that some customers go specifically to find. Its meat selection, particularly its steaks, fits perfectly in this category, as customers are always treated to a wide selection of high-quality cuts. USDA Prime (the highest quality beef can achieve) cuts are abundant and are defined by more marbling, tenderness, and flavor than USDA Choice or Select. While Costco sources its veal from Atlantic Veal and Lamb of New York (a source from more than 100 American farms), its beef primarily comes from California farmers in the San Joaquin Valley. It also sources from Iowa Premium and Snake River Farms, the former of which sources from over 1,200 local farmers, and the latter provides quality wagyu beef. Costco does not stock organic beef that's been fed hormones and/or antibiotics, but this isn't the biggest driver of their meat. The store uses a blade tenderizer when working its steaks, which (aside from a more thorough tenderization) severs the muscle and tissue more cleanly than other processes. This creates cleaner and better quality cuts, which leads to better quality steaks (even if they source their beef from similar places as their competitors) that are consistently rated four stars or more by their customers. One of the more common grocery stores in America, Meijer offers a high-quality steak selection to a wide customer base. The chain sources its meats from Certified Angus Beef, Purely Meat, Grass Run Farms, Niman Ranch, Pre Brands, and other regional-based distributors, which has led to consistently well-reviewed cuts by their customers. When visiting the website, almost every cut of steak has a rating of four stars or higher (out of five). Both Certified Angus Beef and Purely Meat are major factors in the higher quality of Meijer's steaks, as the latter helped not only to keep operations moving during COVID-19 (when many other suppliers were shut down), but to raise the overall quality of the meat the store carries. As of today, the store carries some of the most consistently highly rated steaks of any grocer. With there being Meijer locations across the country, you can't go wrong stopping in for some sincerely splendid slabs of steak. Known for its cheap prices compared to its competitors, Aldi doesn't let this keep it from stocking its shelves with quality products. Aldi steak, for example, comes in multiple delicious cuts that can be found for noticeably cheaper than similar cuts at other stores. This isn't because its beef is of worse quality, but that Aldi has carved out a way to obtain and package meat that goes around the issues their competitors face. For example, per Daily Meal rather than sourcing all its meat for stores from one or a small few places, Aldi opts to obtain meat from local farms and distributors. Doing so helps to avoid the costs that go along with shipping, as well as to avoid any added preservatives. The store also stocks private-label products for a large portion of its meat selection, which means it orders meat from a third-party source and sells it under its own name. This helps to reduce costs for things such as marketing, paying an in-house butcher, and (again) shipping and the maintenance associated with it, as well as allowing more specificity when placing orders. Although Aldi's lower meat prices can cause skepticism over the quality of its products, its steak is not to be missed. Despite the store not providing direct customer feedback for individual items on its site, its steak is regularly considered to be high quality by shoppers (despite its lower price tag). Some on Reddit have even called the marbling of Aldi steak "supreme." Sprouts is the banner holder of a more uniquely granola-type of grocery store, and that brings in many shoppers, who choose it religiously. Although all its food is high quality, the steak selection is the best of any grocery store in America. It sources its steak from Grass Run Farms, which provides grass-fed Angus steaks that are more marbled and succulent than your typical grocer's in-house steaks. Sprouts offers a selection of grass-fed, pasture-raised, and pre-prepared/ready-to-cook varieties, while emphasizing fresh, not frozen, meat, and a butcher counter that can assist with any questions or requests that you may have. Sprouts ranked as Tasting Table's top grocery store for meat for a reason, as the care to both source the best meat and provide the best cuts to its customers has resulted in the best overall selection of any grocery store. We've even recommended that Sprouts be your go-to for all meats, not just steak, which lends to the overall quality of the store. Its selections include a variety of cuts for whatever you may be making, including from the chuck/brisket/shank, the ribs/plate, the loin/flank, and the round/top round. While there is a bit more effort required to acquire a cut of steak from Sprouts (due to the higher pricing and lack of store presence outside the Southern states), it's well worth it, as these are some of the best cuts available in grocery stores today and have an overwhelming majority of five-star reviews on most of their in-house steaks. Each selection on this list has to be the store's own brand or label, and not products that can specifically be found in other stores. So while stores may source from the same suppliers, each store has its own processing/packaging processes that contribute to the varying qualities between different stores. They also had to be generally well reviewed by customers, so if a store has one or two cuts of steaks that are highly rated, but most are rated three stars or less, then it would not be included. Conversely, if a store has certain cuts that have been occasionally rated negatively, but that are widely well reviewed by customers, it isn't entirely discounted from being included. As mentioned, each store has its own processes for steak procurement and processing, which will lead to the inevitable missteps from time to time. The stores included in this list were ranked based on where and how they source meats, overall customer reviews, and (when necessary) value provided to the customer compared to competitors.

Title: Low Fat Cheese Market to Worth Over US$ 160.1 Billion by 2033 | Astute Analytica

November 24, 2025 08:30 ET | Source: AstuteAnalytica India Pvt. Ltd. AstuteAnalytica India Pvt. Ltd. Chicago, Nov. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The global low fat cheese market was valued at US$ 121.6 billion in 2024 and is expected to reach US$ 160.1 billion by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 3.1% from 2025–2033. Stakeholders in the low fat cheese market must recognize that vague health claims no longer satisfy consumers; specific nutrient density is the new currency. For instance, Babybel Light has set a strict calorie-controlled benchmark with exactly 50 calories per piece, while Sargento Reduced Fat Sharp Cheddar directly addresses lipid concerns by delivering just 5 grams of fat per serving. Concurrently, protein maximization is reshaping formulation strategies, evidenced by Arla Protein Lite Cheddar slices offering a substantial 20 grams of protein per serving. Similarly, Horizon Organic Lowfat Cottage Cheese provides a robust 14 grams of protein per half-cup serving. Arla’s innovation extends further, boasting 40% less fat than standard cheddar, proving that consumers demand high functionality without dietary compromise. Request Sample Pages: https://www.astuteanalytica.com/request-sample/low-fat-cheese-market Beyond macronutrients, sodium reduction has become a precise science within the low fat cheese market. Standard Swiss cheese naturally leads with a low 53 milligrams of sodium per ounce, setting a high bar for processed alternatives. In the cooking segment, Ricotta cheese averages 123 milligrams of sodium per half-cup serving, whereas newer low-salt white cheese formulations in 2024 have reached 400 milligrams of sodium per 30-gram serving. Manufacturers like Sargento are also fortifying these reduced-fat matrices with Vitamin A Palmitate to restore lost nutritional density. These meticulous specifications highlight a shift where every milligram counts in the consumer's decision-making process. Key Findings in Low Fat Cheese Market Global Production Capabilities are Shaping Supply Chain Availability Supply volume acts as the backbone of the growing low fat cheese market, with global cheese production forecast to reach a massive 22.55 million metric tons in the 2024/2025 marketing year. Within the United States, total cheese production was projected to hit 6.55 million metric tons in 2024, providing ample base material for nutritional modification. Specifically, Italian-type cheese production—critical for low-fat mozzarella variants—totaled 499 million pounds in August 2024 alone. Notably, US Mozzarella production accounts for 79.5% of the total Italian cheese category, significantly outpacing American-type cheese production, which totaled 478 million pounds in the same month. Regional production hubs in the low fat cheese market are adjusting their outputs to feed this global appetite. Australia's cheese production is projected to reach 435,000 metric tons in 2024, while New Zealand produced 400,000 tons in the 2023/2024 cycle to meet export needs. Domestically, US per capita cheese consumption reached nearly 42 pounds per person in the 2024 reporting cycle, signaling robust demand. Trends indicate that Mozzarella sticks will see the fastest segment growth through 2034, while Ricotta cheese held the largest product segment share in 2024. Such volume data confirms that the market is supported by a highly active global production network. Inventory Deficits Signal Tightening Conditions For Market Stakeholders Recent data suggests a tightening of supply that could increase urgency within the low fat cheese market. US natural cheese stocks in cold storage dropped by 33 million pounds in September 2024, a significant contraction relative to expectations. Furthermore, the US$A revised its August 2024 stock figures downward by 6.6 million pounds, compounding the deficit. American cheese stocks specifically fell by 29 million pounds in September 2024. These reductions imply that demand is outpacing immediate storage capabilities, creating potential pinch points for retailers seeking consistent inventory flow. However, contrasting inventory signals present a complex landscape for buyers. Total butter stocks exceeded forecasts by 7 million pounds in September 2024, creating a divergence between fat and protein commodities. Forward-looking projections for December 2024 showed a potential 19 million pound surplus in cheese stocks, suggesting relief may be on the horizon. In related protein sectors, pork bellies stocks dropped 25% in August 2024, while overall US natural cheese supplies ended August 2024 1% lower than the previous month. Stakeholders in the low fat cheese market must navigate these mixed inventory signals to optimize procurement strategies. Volatile Wholesale Costs are Directly Influencing Retail Margin Structures Fluctuations in raw material costs are currently dictating the profitability of the low fat cheese market. On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Cheddar block prices traded at US$ 1.79 per pound for the week ending November 15, 2025, showing distinct volatility compared to the US$ 1.50 per pound recorded in January 2024. Meanwhile, Cheddar barrel prices reached US$ 2.005 per pound in August 2024, creating an unusual dynamic where processing cheese cost more than blocks. The price gap between block and barrel cheese stood at 4.75 cents in August 2024, a metric that processors watch closely when calculating margins for shredded low-fat blends. International auctions reflect similarly high valuations for key ingredients. Global Cheddar cheese prices at the Global Dairy Trade auction averaged US$ 4,973 per metric ton in November 2024, while Mozzarella prices averaged US$ 4,607 per metric ton. Additionally, Dry whey prices—often used in protein fortification—averaged 62.6 cents per pound in November 2025. These input costs force manufacturers in the low fat cheese market to balance premium pricing with competitive value propositions. Rising wholesale indices suggest that cost containment will remain a primary challenge for the remainder of the fiscal year. Premium Retail Pricing Reflects Strong Demand For Healthy Variants Retailers are successfully maintaining premium price points, validating the value-add nature of the low fat cheese market. Horizon Organic Lowfat Cottage Cheese, for example, retails for US$ 6.49 per 16-ounce tub, positioning it as a high-tier option. In the snacking aisle, Babybel Reduced Fat commands approximately US$ 4.99 at major US retailers, while Knudsen Lowfat Cottage Cheese holds a similar price point of US$ 4.99 for a 16-ounce container. These consistent price floors indicate that health-conscious consumers are willing to absorb higher costs for perceived nutritional benefits. Convenience formats further enhance margin potential for retailers in the low fat cheese market. Sargento Balanced Breaks retail for US$ 4.99 per 3-pack unit, capitalizing on the intersection of health and portability. Similarly, Frigo Cheese Heads in the string cheese segment retail for US$ 6.49 for a 10-ounce pack. Even in the meal category, Amy’s Kitchen Light in Sodium Macaroni & Cheese retails for US$ 3.79 per 9-ounce package, while Organic Valley 2% Milk—a key input proxy—retails for US$ 5.99 per gallon. These figures confirm that the market supports robust pricing structures across diverse product categories. Expanding International Trade Volumes are Reshaping Export Demand Channels in Low Fat Cheese Market Export markets are absorbing a significant portion of production, acting as a vital release valve for the market. US cheese exports totaled 42,459 metric tons in August 2024 alone. Impressively, cumulative US cheese exports for the first eight months of 2024 reached roughly 60,146 metric tons above the previous year's baseline. Mexico remains a primary partner, with exports increasing by 2,256 metric tons in August 2024. Within that flow, exports of "Other Cheese"—a category often housing processed and low-fat blends—rose by 1,942 metric tons, highlighting specific demand for versatile formulations. Global appetite extends beyond North America low fat cheese market, influencing long-term trade forecasts. US cheese exports to the MENA region increased by 1,245 metric tons in August 2024. Looking ahead, Japan is forecast to import an additional 6,886 metric tons of US cheddar-type cheeses between 2025 and 2026, adding to a total import volume that exceeded 251,913 metric tons. However, shifts are evident; Cheddar exports to Japan fell by 1,742 metric tons in August 2024, suggesting a pivot toward other varieties. With total US cheese exports for 2024 forecast to hit a record 508,808 metric tons, international trade remains a pillar of the market. Major Market Players Face Intense Competition From Private Label The competitive landscape of the low fat cheese market is defined by a battle between legacy brands and store-brand dominance. Sargento Foods remains a powerhouse, reporting peak annual revenue of US$ 1.3 billion in 2024, with shredded unit sales recorded at 116 million units. However, Kraft continues to lead in volume, with shredded unit sales reaching 266 million units. Despite these massive branded numbers, Private Label shredded cheese—often the entry point for budget-conscious low-fat shoppers—achieved a staggering 1.25 billion unit sales, dwarfing individual branded competitors. Smaller segments show equally fierce positioning battles. Tillamook recorded 42 million unit sales in the natural cheese category, carving out a premium niche. In the shelf-stable arena, Sargento holds the position of the No. 8 seller, while Mondelēz International saw cheese unit sales of 13 million. These metrics illustrate that while brand equity drives revenue, volume in the low fat cheese market is heavily swayed by private label accessibility. Brands must therefore innovate relentlessly to justify their price premiums against generic alternatives. Looking for Country-Level or Section-Wise Data?

Arla Foods launched a new line of organic low-fat cottage cheese in February 2024, catering to the clean-label demographic. Similarly, Saputo Inc. introduced LightLife Mozzarella Shreds for foodservice, while Horizon Organic introduced a new organic low-fat cheese product in April 2024. These launches underscore the industry's pivot toward functional, high-quality offerings that elevate the perception of the low fat cheese market. Europe’s market value of US$ 38.9 billion in 2024 further validates the scale of this opportunity. Beyond traditional dairy, allergen-free attributes are expanding the addressable market. Babybel Plant-Based contains 0 grams of lactose, appealing to those with sensitivities, while Bel Brands expanded its dairy-free distribution to major retailers like Costco in 2024. Ricotta cheese held the largest product segment share in 2024, driven by its versatility in healthy cooking. Furthermore, gluten-free and lactose-free claims were key drivers in Arla's 2024 product expansions. These diverse innovation vectors ensure that the low fat cheese market remains dynamic and relevant to evolving consumer lifestyles.
