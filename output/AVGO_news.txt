Title: Appaloosa's Tepper Sells Off Chunks of Chinese Tech Stakes

Billionaire investor David Tepper apparently no longer thinks it's time to buy "everything" in China. Tepper's hedge fund Appaloosa L.P. slashed its stakes in several Chinese companies in recent months, according to the firm's latest 13-F filing. The fund slashed its position in Baidu (BIDU) nearly in half and its stakes in Alibaba Group (BABA), JD.com (JD), Temu parent PDD Holdings (PDD), and Chinese real estate platform KE Holdings (BEKE) by 19% to 26% since its last filing in February. It also lowered its stake in the iShares China Large Cap ETF (FXI) and KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF (KWEB) by about 16% and 13%, respectively. In an interview with CNBC last September, the owner of the NFL's Carolina Panthers said the government stimulus package China was putting into its economy at the time made it an attractive place for investors. Tepper said he would want to buy "everything" in the country, as the stimulus would impact assets from stocks to ETFs and bonds. The latest filing also revealed that Appaloosa opened a 130,000-share position in Broadcom (AVGO) in the last three months, and that it sold the last of its stakes in FedEx (FDX) and Intel (INTC). The firm also boosted its shares of Meta Platforms (META), and cut its ownership of Lyft (LYFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Oracle (ORCL) and Microsoft (MSFT).
