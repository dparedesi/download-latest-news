The gloom that has hung over Wall Street in recent weeks showed signs of dissipating on Monday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was up about 2.4% in recent trading, leading the major indexes higher after lagging during Friday’s rally. Big tech shares and many of Wall Street’s favorite AI stocks were among Monday’s top gainers, with chipmakers Broadcom (AVGO) and Micron (MU) each up more than 7% and all of the Magnificent Seven stocks in the green. Dip-buying retail investors may be partly responsible. Money poured into S&P 500 exchange-traded funds last week while the index slumped, according to a UBS note, while ETF inflows as a percent of assets under management climbed to their highest level this year—both signs, the analysts wrote, of individual-investor optimism. And inflows into leveraged funds accelerated throughout the sell-off, according to Deutsche Bank analysts, another potential sign of retail's confidence. There are signs of improving investor sentiment, particularly among retail investors, heading into the Thanksgiving holiday. Retail investor behavior often reflects market sentiment, or vibes, as they usually lack the detailed market data and sophisticated algorithms of institutional investors. Sentiment is itself one of the main drivers of stock market returns. Stocks sold off last week as concerns about an AI bubble and uncertainty about the trajectory of monetary policy weighed on sentiment. The S&P 500 lost nearly 2% and the Nasdaq dropped 2.7%. Equity positioning turned underweight—indicating caution—for the first time since July, according to Deutsche Bank. Chief among investors’ concerns was whether the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates next month. Signs of a weakening labor market argue for a cut, while evidence that inflation is accelerating well above the Fed's 2% target could drive caution. Rate-cut expectations jumped all over the place last week. The September jobs report—the last piece of official labor market data policymakers are likely to see before they meet—sent mixed signals, causing expectations to plummet. But they rebounded Friday when one Fed official indicated he was open to cutting. As of Monday, market participants put the odds of a December rate cut at about 77%, up from just 30% last Wednesday. Investors are also debating whether the AI boom that’s fueled the bull market is a perilous bubble. A stronger-than-expected earnings report from chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) last week wasn’t enough to put those fears to bed. AI stocks continued to slump following the report, and many missed out on Friday’s rally entirely. Calm returned to markets Monday. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), known as Wall Street's “Fear Index,” recently stood at about 21, a tick above the level associated with smooth sailing for stocks. And CNN’s Fear & Greed index, which tracks seven market metrics to gauge the prevailing sentiment among investors, looked less scary after notching its most pessimistic reading since early April. Last week's AAII Sentiment Survey of individual investors, meanwhile, also showed a slightly more optimistic outlook than seen a week earlier, when nearly half of respondents were bearish. Economic data this week could test that calm. Investors will be watching jobless claims data on Wednesday for a clearer picture of the state of the job market. And the Producer Price Index for September, due Tuesday, should fill out the Fed's picture of inflation; it's likely to be the last inflation data released before the Fed makes its rate decision.

Shares of an off-price apparel retailer climbed after the company touted its success in the back-to-school season and issued a rosy outlook for the critical holiday quarter. Meanwhile, a database software firm remained under pressure as questions linger about its valuation and capacity to meet lofty targets. Major U.S. equities indexes bounced back Friday, clawing back losses posted in the prior session. The S&P 500 ended the final trading session of the week 0.9% higher. The Dow added 1.1%, while the Nasdaq rose 0.8%. See here for Investopedia's full wrap-up of Friday's major market moves. Shares of Ross Stores (ROST) surged 8.4% after the off-price apparel, footwear, and accessories retailer surpassed third-quarter sales and profit estimates. The company is the latest discount retailer to demonstrate it's benefiting from consumers' bargain-seeking. Ross highlighted strength in the back-to-school shopping season and raised its outlook, pointing to optimism about the crucial holiday period. Comments from John Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, helped boost expectations that policymakers might cut interest rates in December. Rate-cut optimism boosted the stocks of companies exposed to the housing market, which stand to benefit from lower mortgage rates. Shares of residential construction materials supplier Builders FirstSource (BLDR) jumped 7.1%, while homebuilders D.R. Horton (DHI) and Lennar (LEN) also notched solid gains. Insulet (PODD) shares climbed 5.8% a day after the medical device maker held an investor day event. The manufacturer of continuous glucose monitoring devices provided a three-year sales and profit forecast that exceeded consensus expectations. Several research firms raised their price targets on Insulet stock following the event. Oracle (ORCL) shares tumbled 5.7%, extending their recent downtrend and suffering the heaviest decline of any S&P 500 stock Friday. The database software and cloud computing giant has been rattled recently by concerns about its elevated valuation and heavy borrowing tied to its data center investments. Following Friday's drop, the stock is down around 28% over the past month. Nvidia (NVDA) shares slid 1% as concerns about an AI bubble continued to weigh on high-flying tech stocks. Friday's decline extended the stock's 3% loss yesterday despite the AI chip giant blowing past estimates with its third-quarter earnings report. Nvidia's largest rivals, Broadcom (AVGO) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), shed 1.9% and 1.1%, respectively, on Friday. Nuclear power providers Vistra (VST) and Constellation Energy Corp. (CEG), whose stocks soared over the past year as they struck multi-billion dollar deals to power AI data centers, were also dogged by bubble fears. Their stocks fell a respective 3% and 2.2%.

Title: Want $4,000 per Year in Monthly Passive Income? Invest Just $2,500 in These Yield-Heavy Dividend Stocks

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Panchenko Vladimir / Shutterstock.com It would be an impressive feat to generate $4,000 in yearly passive income with just $12,500 in your account. Yet, it’s actually possible if you invest $2,500 into five carefully chosen stocks or exchange traded funds (ETFs). Not only that, but you could get paid cash distributions every month and possibly even every week. The plan is to own high-yield stocks that represent profitable businesses which pay monthly dividends. Also, you can own some ETFs offering big yields and frequent cash payouts. Allocating $2,500 toward the five assets on today’s list means you’d be investing $12,500 in total. It’s possible to earn $4,000 per year in dividends/distributions is you achieve an average yield of at least $4,000 / $12,500 or 32%. Sure, that’s ambitious and these five stocks/ETFs carry some risk; for example, any of the annual yields might get cut. On the other hand, you could become a passive income overachiever simply by holding five assets, so let’s start off with two high-paying stock picks. We’ll begin with Oxford Square Capital Corp. (NASDAQ:OXSQ), a business development company mainly specializing in bank loans and collateralized loan obligations (CLOs). Since Oxford Square Capital Corp. sends out its cash dividends on a monthly basis, you can take advantage of frequent reinvestment and compounding opportunities. It’s smart to focus on income-positive businesses in order to mitigate your overall risk level. As it turns out, Oxford Square Capital Corp. is income-positive as it reported roughly $5.56 million of third-quarter 2025 net investment income. At the moment, Oxford Square Capital Corp. offers a 22.46% forward annual dividend yield. This doesn’t measure up to our objective of achieving an average yield of at least 32%. Nevertheless, buying $2,500 worth of OXSQ stock is a good start as we’ll raise the average yield later with some mega-yield ETFs. Another stock you could invest $2,500 into is Orchid Island Capital (NYSE:ORC). This company is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that concentrates on U.S.-based residential mortgage-backed securities. Like Oxford Square Capital Corp., Orchid Island Capital pays dividends every month. Furthermore, Orchid Island Capital is a profitable business enterprise, having recorded $72.08 million in Q3 2025 net income. Being income-positive implies, more or less, that these companies should be able to continue paying monthly cash dividends. Currently, Orchid Island Capital stock investors can expect a 20.14% forward annual dividend yield. We’re still below our 32% average yield target, but there’s no need to fret as I’ve got a three-pack of ETFs that could bring massive payouts. To raise the bar in terms of overall annual yield, you could invest $2,500 into three funds from Roundhill. These ETFs all pay distributions on a weekly basis, so you can continue to receive cash payments every month or even more often than that. To provide a simplified explanation, the following Roundhill ETFs trade shares of a well-known stock as well as a type of derivatives known as swaps. This typically raises the risk level but also enables substantial income-generation opportunities. First, we have the Roundhill AMZN WeeklyPay ETF (CBOE:AMZW), which trades shares and swaps to indirectly extract income from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock. Unlike a direct investment in Amazon stock, you’ll receive weekly cash distributions if you hold AMZW shares. Clarifying the fund’s objective, Roundhill explains that the AMZW ETF targets “enhanced returns corresponding to 120% of” the weekly performance of AMZN stock. The expected annual distribution rate of the Roundhill AMZN WeeklyPay ETF is quite hefty at 37.57%. Next up is the Roundhill TSLA WeeklyPay ETF (CBOE:TSLW), which uses similar trading strategies to indirectly derive income from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock. In particular, the TSLW ETF aims for “enhanced returns corresponding to 120% of” the weekly performance of TSLA stock. There’s risk involved as the share price of the Roundhill TSLA WeeklyPay ETF may be volatile. However, it’s hard to resist the fund’s massive 53.28% annual distribution rate, no doubt. Then there’s the Roundhill AVGO WeeklyPay ETF (CBOE:AVGW), which attempts to achieve similar results with Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock. Again, the share-price volatility risk shouldn’t be overlooked, but the AVGW ETF’s gigantic 54.68% distribution rate makes it a worthwhile addition to this list. So, have we reached or objective of a 32% or higher average annual yield? To fond out, we just need to add up the expected yields of OXSQ, ORC, AMZW, TSLW, and AVGW and then divide the total by five. The result is a 37.63% average annual yield between these five stocks/ETFs. Thus, we’ve put together a plan to earn at least $4,000 per year in dividends/distributions (assuming there are no yield cuts) with monthly or even weekly cash payments to your account.
