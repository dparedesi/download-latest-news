Title: Nvidia, TSMC, chip stocks crash as Trump’s new tariffs shake semiconductor industry – How will rising costs and supply chain disruptions impact AI and tech companies?

Following Trump’s announcement, Nvidia stock fell over 5%, while its competitor Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) dropped about 4%. Broadcom (AVGO) saw a steep 7% decline, and Micron Technology (MU), a key memory chip supplier for Nvidia’s GPUs, also lost 7% in value. TSMC, the Taiwanese giant responsible for manufacturing advanced semiconductors for companies like Nvidia and Apple (AAPL), also sank approximately 5%. This reaction in the stock market reflects growing fears about supply chain disruptions and cost increases due to new tariff measures. Trump revealed that starting April 5, a 10% baseline tariff would be applied globally. However, from April 9 onward, reciprocal tariffs will be imposed based on individual countries’ trade practices: This move is expected to impact chip imports from these countries, which are major suppliers of AI servers, laptops, and other high-tech products to the U.S. These tariffs directly impact companies like Nvidia, which rely heavily on Taiwan and China for chip manufacturing. TSMC, the world’s leading semiconductor foundry, plays a critical role in producing chips for Nvidia, AMD, and even Intel (INTC). The U.S. imported around $19 billion in servers equipped with Nvidia GPUs from Taiwan and $34 billion from China in 2024, according to trade data compiled by Michigan State University’s supply chain expert Jason Miller. These tariffs will increase costs for U.S. companies relying on these imports, potentially slowing demand for AI chips and computing hardware. Trump has positioned these tariffs as a way to push companies to manufacture their chips in the U.S. He pointed to TSMC’s $100 billion investment in Arizona, an expansion that started under the Biden administration with support from the U.S. Chips and Science Act. However, industry experts are skeptical. Truist analyst William Stein surveyed 10 semiconductor manufacturers and distributors, and none indicated plans to move operations to the U.S. in response to these tariffs. One respondent even suggested that companies are avoiding major investments in new locations because they doubt these tariffs will be permanent. Despite the immediate stock drop, some analysts believe AI chipmakers like Nvidia may weather the storm better than others. Stein noted that AI companies are in an aggressive race to develop Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) at almost any cost, meaning demand for Nvidia’s GPUs may remain strong despite higher prices. However, long-term impacts remain uncertain. If these tariffs stay in place, they could lead to increased costs for U.S. tech companies, potential supply chain restructuring, and shifts in global chip manufacturing strategies. For now, investors and industry leaders will be closely watching how these tariffs unfold and whether further trade actions follow.

Title: Buy, Sell, Or Hold AVGO Stock At $170 Amid Trump’s Tariffs?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. AVGO Stock Following President Trump’s announcement of extensive tariffs on over 100 countries, Broadcom stock (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock fell by over 6% in after-hours trading on Wednesday. The announced tariffs include a significant 34% levy on imports from China, a major global manufacturing hub. While semiconductor goods are reportedly exempt from these specific tariffs, the broader macroeconomic consequences are a concern. The imposition of tariffs on Chinese products is expected to increase costs within the economy, potentially leading to slower economic growth or even a recession. This economic downturn could, in turn, reduce overall investment in areas like Artificial Intelligence, which could negatively impact Broadcom’s sales and future performance. Separately, see Will Apple Stock Fall To $150 On Tariff Troubles? Notably, AVGO stock looks attractive, given its solid financial performance lately, but it trades at lofty valuations making it a tricky pick at its current price of around $170. We arrive at our conclusion by comparing the current valuation of AVGO stock with its operating performance over the recent years as well as its current and historical financial condition. Our analysis of Broadcom along key parameters of Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience shows that the company has a very strong operating performance and financial condition, as detailed below. That said, if you seek upside with lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High-Quality portfolio presents an alternative - having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, AVGO stock looks very expensive compared to the broader market. Broadcom’s Revenues have grown considerably over recent years. Broadcom’s profit margins are much higher than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. Broadcom's balance sheet looks strong. AVGO stock has been more resilient than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy, how bad can things get if there is another recession? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes. In summary, Broadcom's performance across the parameters detailed above are as follows: Broadcom’s strong performance suggests that its stock might be an attractive investment. However, this positive outlook is tempered by the stock’s high valuation. Currently, AVGO is trading at 13 times its trailing revenues and 140 times its trailing earnings. This is notably higher than its average valuation over the past four years, which stood at 14 times sales and 71 times earnings. Consequently, despite its robust performance, the stock appears expensive based on these metrics, leading to the conclusion that AVGO is a potentially tricky stock to buy at its current price. Not too happy about the volatile nature of AVGO stock? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Intel will spin off its 'non-core' businesses, new CEO says

Intel (INTC-10.50%) will spin off some of its non-core businesses, newly minted CEO Lip-Bu Tan said at the company’s Vision 2025 conference in Las Vegas on Monday. “Going forward at Intel, we will redefine some of our strategy and then free up the bandwidth. Some of the non-core business, we will spin it off, but really focus on our core business and how to expand that using AI and Software 2.0,” Tan said in what was his first public appearance as company CEO. Tan didn’t directly name which businesses were going to be considered core versus non-core. Tan was named CEO earlier last month, coming on the heels of a rocky time in the tech giant’s history. “It had been a tough period for quite a long time for Intel, we fell behind on innovation and as a result, we have been too slow to adapt and meet your needs,” Tan said, addressing the crowd of customers and investors in Las Vegas. “I will pull together strong teams to correct the past mistakes and start to earn your trust. My motto is very simple: under-promise and over-deliver, that has been my trademark,” he added. The company has been struggling to keep pace with competitors like Nvidia (NVDA-5.83%), which replaced Intel in the Dow Jones Industrial Average back in November 2024. The company has also been the target of possible acquisitions and has been working with investment bankers at Morgan Stanley (MS-6.97%) and Goldman Sachs (GS-6.87%) to right its business, including by potentially splitting its foundry division. Broadcom (AVGO-2.40%) is reportedly looking to buy Intel’s chip design and marketing unit, while Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM-6.02%) is eyeing Intel’s chip manufacturing plants. Intel’s former CEO Pat Gelsinger, who was ousted in December, had helmed an initiative to revamp the company’s foundry division, which designs and manufactures chips. Tan in his speech, also committed to build out the chips foundry business. “Global demand for chip production is growing, and you need supply chains that are flexible, resilient, and secure. Intel foundry plays a crucial role. We will continue to advance our foundry strategy to meet your needs,” Tan said. Other top priorities for Intel going forward will be to retain and recruit top engineering talent and to return to its roots of “an engineering-first company,” Tan said. Tan also emphasized that he would like to see Intel act more like a startup. “Most importantly, we will simplify the way we work. Bureaucracy kills innovation. In my career, I’ve seen how small, focused teams can move very fast and innovate and take on incumbents, and we’re going to practice that in Intel,” Tan said.
