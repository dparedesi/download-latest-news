Title: 5 big analyst AI moves: SK Hynix hit by double downgrade; ADI named Top Semis Pick

Investing.com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week. InvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today! During the week, William Blair analysts have initiated coverage on Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) with an Outperform rating, voicing confidence in the company’s potential for strong earnings per share (EPS) growth and stock price appreciation over the coming years. The firm pointed to several growth drivers for Arm, including “1) higher Average Selling Prices (ASPs) driven by improved monetization and higher value IP; 2) share gains in newer markets like data center; 3) tailwinds from AI driving higher demand for overall compute; and 4) a new upgrade cycle in mobile/PCs.” While Arm’s stock trades at a premium compared to its peers, William Blair believes this is justified by the company’s robust growth outlook, which is expected to become clearer in the financial forecasts for 2026 and 2027. Their discounted cash flow analysis indicates around 35% upside potential for Arm’s shares, supported by sustained revenue growth and increasing profitability over the next decade. In a separate note, William Blair also assigned an Outperform rating to Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), noting the company's strategic expansion into software as a way to buffer against the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry. The firm believes that the chipmaker is positioned for continued growth, driven by AI-related demand in networking and custom chip segments, along with the shift to subscription-based models in its VMware (NYSE:VMW) division. Analysts highlighted that nearly two-thirds of VMware customers have transitioned to subscriptions, a significant rise from the 30% seen prior to the acquisition. They also noted that AVGO is trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 26x and an enterprise value to free cash flow ratio of 22x based on their 2025 projections, slightly below the median of its peers. “We see room for multiple expansion as the sustainability of growth in networking, customer AI chips, and software becomes clearer,” the note states. Shares of SK Hynix (KS:000660) dropped on Thursday following a double downgrade from Morgan Stanley, with analysts shifting their rating from Overweight to Underweight. In a note, analysts remarked that "the sun is still shining" for the company at the moment. They predict 2024 will be another strong year for SK Hynix, driven by increasing DRAM prices heading into the fourth quarter, which should lead to "exceptional near-term earnings." However, the outlook beyond the fourth quarter appears less favorable. While the long-term potential for DRAM, particularly due to AI-driven demand from data centers, is still promising, the firm noted that cyclical shortages are coming to an end. “Looking past 4Q24, we see sustained risks to the top line and EPS as growth slows, pricing falls, and rising competition in high-bandwith memory (HBM) challenges sustainable long-term margins,” the analysts added. In addition to downgrading the stock, Morgan Stanley also cut its price target for SK Hynix by more than half, lowering it from 260,000 to 120,000 Korean won. In a research note released Tuesday, Citi analysts named Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) as their new top pick in the semiconductor sector. The decision follows Citi's update to its semiconductor stock ranking table, which included a price target adjustment for Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) and an upgrade of Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN). The firm maintains a positive outlook on the semiconductor industry as a whole. Citi highlighted ADI's lower downside risk in the automotive sector compared to other analog semiconductor makers, particularly following the company’s recent earnings report. This reduced risk, according to Citi, makes ADI well-positioned amid ongoing market uncertainties, leading the firm to rank it at the top of its semiconductor stock table. "ADI is our top pick," Citi analysts stated, adding that they see "lower downside risk in Autos versus other analog names given they have just announced earnings." Broadcom and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD), both key players in the AI sector, remain in Citi's second and third spots, respectively. Wedbush analysts said that they believe the AI revolution trade has gained momentum following the Federal Reserve’s 50 basis point rate cut, signaling a favorable environment for Big Tech and AI stocks. Wedbush views this aggressive rate cut, alongside a dovish dot plot extending into 2025, as creating a "very bullish backdrop" for the tech sector. The Fed’s move marks a momentous shift, as many investors had been waiting for this signal to fully engage with tech growth stocks leading into 2025. The firm pointed out that the broader technology sector has remained resilient, with recent earnings reports, such as those from Oracle, indicating that the AI revolution is entering its software and application phase.

Title: Eating My Own Cooking: Navigating Buy, Hold And Sell Decisions - ORCL

Ringing the Register on a Portion of my ORCL At The Prudent Speculator, we believe in “eating our own cooking”—aligning our portfolio strategy with the very advice we give to readers. In a recent article, I explored three undervalued stocks recommended to readers of The Prudent Speculator that I added to my personal portfolio, demonstrating my putting my money where my mouth is conviction. Money Where My Mouth Is: 3 Undervalued Stocks For Buckingham Portfolio (forbes.com) This time, I want to expand on the strategy of not just buying undervalued stocks but knowing when to hold or even trim positions when necessary. While our philosophy encourages long-term investing, part of prudent portfolio management involves recognizing when a position has become overweight or when market conditions warrant a reassessment. We aren’t simply passive holders; we continuously evaluate the risk-reward ratio of every stock in our portfolio, ensuring it aligns with our overarching investment goals. Even as I am fond of the Mae West quip that "Too much of a good thing can be wonderful," a ballooning stock position can introduce unnecessary risk. This is why trimming positions—particularly in stocks that have outperformed and attracted more-growth-oriented investors—remains an essential part of our risk management process. Balancing conviction with discipline is key to successful long-term investing in stocks. Oracle (ORCL) is an excellent example of how I navigate the delicate balance between holding a high-performing stock and managing risk. Following Oracle’s 2024 Financial Analyst Day, the company continues to make significant strides, with leadership expressing confidence in exceeding the fiscal 2026 revenue target of $66 billion and suggesting that more than $100 billion in revenue is in the cards in fiscal 2029. With the cloud business growing at a rapid pace, contributing substantially to both top-line and bottom-line growth, it’s no surprise that shares have rallied over 50% this year. Oracle's ability to transition from a product-based model to a cloud-centric one is driving this performance, with gross profit from the cloud outpacing losses from legacy license and support revenue. As EVP Doug Kehring highlighted, Oracle’s impressive 5:1 ratio of cloud profit growth to license decline underscores the company’s lucrative shift to cloud services, positioning the company for strong long-term gains. However, despite our bullish outlook on Oracle’s long-term prospects, our risk management practices, not to mention our penchant for value-investing, dictate taking a little money off the table. After all, ORCL now trades for more than 25 times projected earnings and for more than 8 times sales. True, those numbers are not excessive, but I think they argue for a little caution. As I like to say, the hardest part about market timing is getting the timing right. So, we must be prepared for stocks to continue their upward trajectory once we have placed our sell orders, which has been the case since my ORCL trim. Still, we are reminded of similar occurrences following the trims of Broadcom (AVGO), Lam Research (LRCX) and Qualcomm (QCOM), as those stocks continued higher after our paring of our stake but are now trading well below our sale prices. Even after trimming our Oracle position, I maintain a modestly overweight allocation in both my personal account and for clients, so I would love to see the stock price move higher. My team and I continue to believe the company’s fundamentals remain strong, but caution is warranted in the current environment, where tech stocks have been subject to both quick near-term rallies as well as significant pullbacks. Through careful portfolio adjustments like these, I endeavor to stay aligned with both the long-term growth potential of our investments and the risk thresholds that protect our clients' wealth.
