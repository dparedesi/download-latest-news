Chip pioneer Intel (INTC-5.42%) could see its faltering business be split up by its rivals. The chipmaker has become an acquisition target for its competitors amid recent struggles to compete for dominance in artificial intelligence chips. The company, which rose to prominence with its central processing chips for personal computers and data centers, announced in August that it was laying off more than 15% of employees as part of a plan to reduce capital expenditures by more than $10 billion this year. Intel was reported in August to be working with its longtime investment bankers at Morgan Stanley (MS-0.23%) and Goldman Sachs (GS-0.78%) on options to fix its business, including by splitting its foundry division (which designs and manufactures chips), cutting factory projects, and mergers and acquisitions, according to Bloomberg. Meanwhile, Qualcomm (QCOM+0.80%), which designs smartphone chips, was interested in buying parts of Intel’s business, Reuters reported in September. Now, the chipmaker is reportedly facing separate potential deals that could split its business in two. Broadcom (AVGO-0.96%) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM-1.04%) (TSMC) are interested in Intel’s chip design and manufacturing businesses, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. Intel’s shares climbed by 10% on Tuesday morning after the report, and is up by almost 30% so far this year. However, the chipmaker’s stock is down by more than 40% year over year. TSMC declined to comment. Neither Intel nor Broadcom immediately responded to requests for comment. Here’s what to know about the potential deals that could leave Intel split in two. Broadcom, which designs and develops chips used in smartphones and data centers, is reportedly looking into Intel’s chip design and marketing unit. The company has held informal discussions about making a bid with its advisors, but likely won’t follow through unless it finds a partner to take over Intel’s manufacturing side, people told the Wall Street Journal. The chipmaker has not made an offer, and could decide not to bid, the Wall Street Journal reported. TSMC is reportedly interested in Intel’s chip manufacturing plants. The Taiwanese chipmaker could potentially join an investor consortium or find another way to control some or all of the factories, the Wall Street Journal reported. The Trump administration reportedly asked TSMC to consider taking over Intel’s chip plants, but a White House spokesperson told Quartz that President Donald Trump is unlikely to support a non-U.S. company operating the foundry. Frank Yeary, the interim executive chairman of Intel, has discussed a deal with Trump administration officials and TSMC executives to separate Intel’s manufacturing business, the New York Times reported. Trump’s nominee for commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, has reportedly been involved in the discussions. The U.S. government would have to sign off on a deal between TSMC and Intel. The Taiwanese chipmaker could also face challenges from the Trump administration’s restrictions on immigration, considering that a large part of its engineering team is from Taiwan and other places abroad, people told the Wall Street Journal. Both Intel and TSMC received funding from the Biden administration’s Chips and Science Act, which was focused on boosting semiconductor manufacturing, research, and development in the U.S. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: TSMC doesn't actually want to buy Intel. Here's why

The Trump administration’s push to have TSMC buy Intel’s chipmaking operations faces a major barrier: The Taiwanese firm isn’t actually interested, and even the threat of tariffs probably won’t be enough to force a deal. “TSMC (TSM-1.04%) has stated very clearly that it has no interest in taking a stake in Intel (INTC-5.42%), and running Intel’s fabs alone or in a [joint venture] would be equally unenticing,” Tim Culpan, founder of the media outlet Culpium and a long-time journalist tracking the chip industry from Taiwan, told Quartz. Intel stock surged 16% Tuesday on reports that TSMC and Broadcom (AVGO-0.96%) could each buy different parts of the company. The stock has rallied to start 2025. But TSMC’s leadership is a product of its culture, which probably wouldn’t mesh well with Intel’s, Culpan said. “Intel didn’t fall behind because of a lack of funds or equipment,” he said. “It fell behind because of successive internal failures related to its approach to technological and business development.” TSMC is a foundry that makes semiconductors designed by its clients, not its own chips. So it likes to be neutral, both politically and among its clients and its suppliers. That would be more difficult if it ran the operations of a chip-design firm like Intel. Additionally, a joint venture with Intel would focus on advanced semiconductor technology, so TSMC’s advantage could be jeopardized by leaks, the Taipei Times reported last week, citing Liu Pei-chen, a researcher at the Taiwan Industry Economics Database of the Taiwan Institute of Economic Research. President Donald Trump’s commitment to prioritizing U.S. interests may also put the firm at a disadvantage, Liu told the newspaper. He said the combined risks from a potential deal are great enough that TSMC would do better to accept American tariffs. Its technological edge gives it enough bargaining power to allow it to pass the added costs along to buyers. “It feels like the Trump administration is being poorly advised by people pushing their own agenda, not necessarily what’s best for the U.S.,” Culpan said. It’s a similar approach to President Joe Biden’s but more forceful — and could jeopardize American access to the world’s best chips. “The best solution for everyone,” Culpan said, “would be for TSMC to announce an expansion in Arizona, agree to make more chips for Intel and other U.S. companies, and boost cooperation in packaging, which is crucial to AI.” Any eventual resolution between TSMC and the U.S government can be expected “to involve mutual concessions, ensuring that TSMC derives some strategic or economic benefit,” said Moon Surana, a portfolio manager at Harding Loevner, which owns the stock in its global equity strategy. “Historically, the company has prioritized long-term customer relationships and sustainable value creation over the pursuit of monopolistic pricing power,” she told Quartz. “A similarly balanced outcome is anticipated in this case.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Intel (INTC-5.42%) stock was rising sharply on Tuesday morning as investors weighed the benefits of reported plans that could see rivals acquire parts of its business. One plan could see Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, which is already responsible for about 90% of the world’s advanced semiconductors, acquire Intel’s manufacturing business, The New York Times reported. It could also take a majority stake in the business alongside a group of private equity and tech companies. That idea has been pushed by President Donald Trump’s administration and Howard Lutnick, his nominee to be Commerce Secretary. Frank Yeary, Intel’s interim executive chair, has met with both TSMC (TSM-1.04%) and Trump administration officials about the deal, The Times reported. While the Trump administration asked TSMC to explore the idea, the White House is unlikely to support a deal that would let a foreign entity operate Intel’s factories, the Wall Street Journal reported. Broadcom (AVGO-0.96%) has also been examining Intel’s chip design and manufacturing business, The Journal reported, citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter. The deal, which Broadcom executives have only informally discussed, would hinge on finding a partner to take over Intel’s manufacturing business, The Journal reported. Nothing has been submitted to Intel yet. Qualcomm (QCOM+0.80%) has also been interested in buying some of Intel’s chip design units. Yeary has left the door open for other companies interested in buying Intel’s product business, including Qualcomm, The Times reported. Intel stock surged 10% in Tuesday morning trading. The stock has rallied to start the year. The potential deals come a few months after Intel ousted its former CEO, who failed to help modernize and stabilize the tech giant, which has struggled to compete with rivals such as Nvidia (NVDA+0.76%) and TSMC. The company has also hired help to fend off potential activist investors. In August, Intel announced a plan to save $10 billion in 2025 through measures including a 15% reduction of its workforce. The following month, the company said it would further separate its chip-manufacturing and design operations, and pause factory projects in Germany, Poland, and Malaysia. Despite its issues, Intel said last month that it expects to report break-even profit for the first quarter of 2025, after reporting declining revenue for three periods in a row. In November, the company was awarded a $7.86 billion grant by then-President Joe Biden’s administration to build semiconductors in the U.S. The Trump administration is expected to rely on Intel to make domestic chips, at least as long as TSMC declines to move operations to the U.S. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Bernstein Wants Broadcom To “Stay Away” From Intel’s Fabs, While Cantor Fitzgerald Thinks That A Split Of DesignCo/IFS Is A “Done Deal”

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. The past few days have been chock-full of rumors and tidbits regarding Intel's path forward, and the role, if any, that TSMC and Broadcom (AVGO) might play in salvaging the semiconductor industry's quintessential white elephant. Now, Wall Street analysts are out in droves with their insights on this very fluid situation. Last week, Baird analyst Tristan Gerra cited "discussions from the Asia supply chain" in an investment note to suggest that Intel might be pivoting towards a closer collaboration with TSMC to get its struggling fabrication units off the ground. Specifically, Gerra pointed to a JV-like arrangement between Intel and TSMC: "The fab could be spun off into a new entity jointly owned by TSMC and Intel, and run by TSMC." Separately, we know that Broadcom has also been eyeing Intel's fabs to complement its ASIC design business. Of course, those fabs require a significant induction of capital and talent to attain viability, especially when it comes to sub-2nm nodes. Over the weekend, we reported that TSMC might acquire a 20 percent stake in Intel's foundry business, either via a cash injection or enabling technology transfer. Other reports suggest that Broadcom and Qualcomm might assist a possible deal by placing sizable orders with Intel's fabs. This brings us to the crux of the matter. Cantor Fitzgerald analyst C.J. Muse has now hiked the target for Intel shares from $22 to $29, while maintaining an overall neutral rating. The analyst notes: "The situation at Intel is extraordinarily complex, but where there is smoke, there is typically fire, so we do believe the news reports that suggest a split of DesignCo/IFS is a done deal." Muse believes that the Trump administration is pushing all concerned parties towards a deal to avoid a "GM like situation," with TSMC likely to emerge as the "most logical manager" for Intel's fabs. "We believe the current Administration is worried about lack of leadership and current net leverage at Intel (have not found new CEO; negative FCF) and does not want a GM like situation to emerge for the US’ Crown Semiconductor Jewel." Meanwhile, Bernstein analyst Stacy A. Rasgon wants Broadcom "to stay from the fabs, but would love to see what they could do with the products." While explaining his rationale, Rasgon argues that Intel's x86 businesses (CCG, DCAI, and NEX) are not necessarily "bad businesses on their own," managing to haul in "~$49B in 2024 sales & mid-20’s operating margin." Rasgon thinks that even if Intel's products are "potentially ex-growth, x86 CPUs would be complementary to AVGO’s current portfolio, and one would think overall execution should be far better than Intel’s." The analyst then lays out how a possible deal between Intel and Broadcom should be structured: "We would recommend an all-stock deal if possible. At a ~75% premium (~$40 take-out price, or a mid-high teens multiple) our rough math suggests 20%+ accretion even in a 100% stock scenario, and with very manageable leverage (well under 3x) across a wide range of capitalization structures." Of course, not everyone is upbeat on the prospects of Intel managing to spin off its fabs. For one, Bank of America (BofA) analyst Vivek Arya thinks that splitting up Intel "could be time- consuming and complicated given: 1) Extensive approval requirements from global (China) regulators due to INTC’s dominant ~70% share of PC/server CPU, 2) Mismatch between INTC and TSMC’s manufacturing processes, 3) TSMC’s ongoing fab expansion plans in Arizona with ability to serve AI customers, 4) AVGO’s existing low-levered but high debt ($58bn net debt) balance sheet, and 5) Constraints of INTC’s CHIPS Act funding (design needs to own 50%+ of manufacturing) and ROI requirements from co- investment partners Apollo and Brookfield." Also, Lynx Equity has asked "why would TSM wish to take a stake in Intel’s IFS" given the fact that global fab capacity "at leading and lagging nodes" is no longer in short supply, that Intel's fab business still offers "questionable performance at advanced nodes" and will not break-even until late 2027, and the "IFS’s tortured relationship with the US government via the CHIPS Act?" Lynx Equity argues that "coercion, via threat of tariffs on semis imports, could be a reason for TSM to come to the table," but that the "gaggle of media reports" in recent days could simply be a "trial balloon."

Title: Morgan Stanley Research: With $16 Billion In R&D Spending This Year Alone, NVIDIA “Can Maintain A 4–5‑year Development Cycle By Running Three Design Teams Sequentially — Each With An 18–24‑Month Architectural Cadence”

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. Custom AI-focused ASICs are increasingly being billed as NVIDIA's Achilles heel, capable of bringing down the entire demand-related edifice that NVIDIA has painstakingly built by leveraging its strength in the GPU arena. Yet, Morgan Stanley Research now thinks that ASICs pose no threat to NVIDIA's broader success story. Morgan Stanley: Despite ASICs, Nvidia will continue to maintain a dominant market share. The ASIC category is neither superior nor inferior to commercial GPUs—it is simply another means to achieve the same result. Over the past six months, momentum in the AI sector has clearly… — Jukanlosreve (@Jukanlosreve) February 14, 2025 To wit, Morgan Stanley Research has now penned an exhaustive note on the evolving GPU vs. ASIC paradigm, arguing that NVIDIA faces no material threat to its dominant position in the market. The research arm of the Wall Street titan concedes at the outset that "momentum in the AI sector has clearly shifted toward custom silicon," and so has the market, with NVIDIA currently commanding a ~$3 trillion market capitalization on the back of $32 billion in quarterly revenues, while Broadcom (AVGO) now supports a $1.1 trillion market cap on just $3.2 billion in quarterly revenues. Morgan Stanley Research then notes that the development budget of a given ASIC is generally less than $1 billion, and often much lower. In contrast, NVIDIA spends an insane amount of money to deliver an immaculate product: "... NVIDIA will invest approximately $16 billion in R&D this year alone. With that funding, NVIDIA can maintain a 4–5‑year development cycle by running three design teams sequentially—each with an 18–24‑month architectural cadence—delivering innovation over a five‑year span. In addition, they invest billions in interconnect technologies to boost rack‑scale and cluster‑scale performance..." Of course, custom ASIC's such as Google's Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) are much more customizable. However, Morgan Stanley argues that the "largest AI training and inference clusters are not currently highly customized," and NVIDIA continues to optimize its GPUs for transformer models. Going forward, Morgan Stanley thinks that the greatest utility for highly customized ASICs will lie in "legacy workloads." Yet, some might argue that the cost factor is the biggest draw for customized ASICs, which can cost as little as $3,000 while NVIDIA's H100 is priced at $20,000. Here though, Morgan Stanley argues that there are hidden costs that should be taken into account. For instance, the cluster cost for ASICs is often materially higher as they employ the much more expensive optical connect technology, while NVIDIA's 72‑GPU NVLINK domain leverages the much cheaper copper-based technology. Moreover, with its unmatched buying power, NVIDIA can easily secure preferential rates for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips. The Wall Street titan goes on to note: "The same applies to CoWoS; because many ASICs use smaller dies with larger stacks, the CoWoS cost can be higher than that of NVIDIA. Of course, NVIDIA’s wafer costs might be higher due to reticle‑limited dies, but overall, Nvidia delivers exceptional value." Next, Morgan Stanley argues that 'software developer hours' should also be incorporated in the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) for ASICs, where NVIDIA's CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) SDK is at a distinct advantage and provides for a much more efficient software development experience. Morgan Stanley then goes on to assert that "NVIDIA and AMD will outperform ASIC competitors [this year] — especially in the second half of the year." "The scale of AMD’s investments across the ecosystem tends to far exceed that of ASIC vendors. This year, AMD has completed two acquisitions of AI software assets. One of these—the acquisition of ZT Systems—involved acquiring a major server ODM, divesting the ODM business while retaining key engineering talent related to rack‑ and cluster‑scale computing. Once in possession of such assets, AMD can deploy them across multiple cloud environments, which drives third‑party support and accelerates ecosystem development. Can ASIC designers within the cloud replicate this?" Next, Morgan Stanley Research notes that in 2024, commercial silicon controlled 90 percent of the market, led by NVIDIA's $98 billion in chip-based revenue (on a provisional basis since the GPU manufacturer has yet to announce its earnings for the last quarter) and trailed by AMD at $5 billion. In contrast, custom ASICs controlled only 10 percent of the market in 2024, led by Broadcom with $8 billion in revenue, and trailed by Alchip and Marvel whose combined revenue amounted to only ~$2 billion. In what is a critical prediction, Morgan Stanley then declares: "We expect the 90% share for commercial products to increase slightly this year." To bolster this prediction, the Wall Street behemoth notes that Broadcom is overly reliant on Google's TPU to drive sales. Yet, in 2025, NVIDIA "will grow 50 – 100% more than TPU." Similarly, Marvel is increasingly reliant on Amazon's Trainium ASIC. While Amazon is all set to double its ASIC purchases to ~$4 billion this year, it is also expected to "more than double" its purchases from NVIDIA. Therefore, Morgan Stanley thinks that NVIDIA's "revenue momentum in the second half [of 2025] will be significantly stronger than the builds from ASIC or AMD." Beyond 2026, ASIC growth can explode, with Broadcom's own SAM analysis predicting that "Google, Meta, and Bytedance could each achieve between $60 billion and $90 billion in revenue in the 2027 fiscal year with clusters numbering in the millions." Nonetheless, Morgan Stanley thinks that "the total addressable market (TAM) for AI ASICs would grow from $12 billion in 2024 to $30 billion in 2027—a figure considerably lower than what is being discounted in the market now." Towards the end, the investment bank notes: "NVIDIA's biggest short‑term risk is U.S. export controls, which are equally problematic for AVGO. In the long term, the greatest risk is not competition but a slowdown in investment— which we forecast to occur around mid‑2026." Some posts on wccftech.com may contain affiliate links.
