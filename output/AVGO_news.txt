ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Broadcom’s stock (NASDAQ: AVGO) has climbed nearly 20% in one month, fueled by an optimistic company outlook and a new $10 billion client contract. This significant gain, however, has pushed its trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio to 91. The key question is: How does AVGO stock now compare to its peers, such as NVIDIA, Qualcomm, Intel, and Cisco, in terms of size, valuation, growth, and margins? To provide some context, Broadcom offers semiconductor devices and infrastructure software, which includes set-top box system-on-chips, cable, DSL, and passive optical networking solutions. Why is this important? AVGO has risen 17% in a month – comparing with peers provides context for stock performance, valuation, and financials – revealing whether it is genuinely outperforming or lagging, and ultimately, can this trend persist? Read Buy or Sell AVGO Stock to assess if Broadcom is a solid investment. Additionally, there is always the risk of decline after a robust surge – analyze how the stock has decreased and bounced back in the past through the AVGO Dip Buyer Analysis perspective. While peer comparison is essential, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio assesses much more and aims to minimize stock-specific risks while providing upside potential.
