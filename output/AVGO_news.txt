Major U.S. equities indexes were mixed at midday ahead of a highly anticipated decision on interest rates from the Federal Reserve. The Dow advanced, but the S&P 500 and Nasdaq fell. Workday (WDAY) was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 after activist investor Elliott Investment Management said it took a more than $2 billion stake in the human resources software provider and complemented management on its strategy. Lyft (LYFT) shares soared after Google parent Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Waymo announced an expanded partnership to bring robotaxi service to Nashville starting next year. Shares of rival ridesharing giant Uber (UBER) slumped. U.S.-listed shares of Alibaba (BABA) climbed following a report China Unicom will purchase its artificial intelligence semiconductors. Nvidia (NVDA) shares slid following a report China has blocked the sale of the U.S. company's AI chips to tech companies there. A number of other chipmakers and AI investor favorites, including Broadcom (AVGO), Oracle (ORCL), and Palantir (PLTR), also lost ground. Oil and gold futures edged lower. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was little changed. The U.S. dollar was up on the euro but lost ground to the pound and yen. Prices for most major cryptocurrencies were higher.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Broadcom’s stock (NASDAQ: AVGO) has climbed nearly 20% in one month, fueled by an optimistic company outlook and a new $10 billion client contract. This significant gain, however, has pushed its trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio to 91. The key question is: How does AVGO stock now compare to its peers, such as NVIDIA, Qualcomm, Intel, and Cisco, in terms of size, valuation, growth, and margins? To provide some context, Broadcom offers semiconductor devices and infrastructure software, which includes set-top box system-on-chips, cable, DSL, and passive optical networking solutions. Why is this important? AVGO has risen 17% in a month – comparing with peers provides context for stock performance, valuation, and financials – revealing whether it is genuinely outperforming or lagging, and ultimately, can this trend persist? Read Buy or Sell AVGO Stock to assess if Broadcom is a solid investment. Additionally, there is always the risk of decline after a robust surge – analyze how the stock has decreased and bounced back in the past through the AVGO Dip Buyer Analysis perspective. While peer comparison is essential, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio assesses much more and aims to minimize stock-specific risks while providing upside potential. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which comprises a collection of 30 stocks, boasts a history of comfortably beating its benchmark that includes all three – the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 indices. Why is this? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have generated superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index; it is less volatile, as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
