Title: S&P 500 Weekly Winners: How AI Powered The Surge
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/08/sp-500-weekly-winners-how-ai-powered-the-surge/
Time Published: 2025-09-08T13:28:50Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. During the week ending September 5, the S&P 500 was essentially unchanged, slipping 0.12%. In contrast, several S&P 500 constituents—particularly AI-related names—posted strong gains. The week’s top movers were propelled by upbeat quarterly surprises, sizable chip agreements, and constructive regulatory developments. Macroeconomic data pointed to a softer labor market: nonfarm payrolls in August rose by only 22,000, well below the 75,000 forecast, while the unemployment rate edged up to 4.3%. Together, these readings reinforce expectations that the Federal Reserve will move forward with a widely anticipated interest rate cut later this month. We detail the biggest movers below. That said, if you’re seeking upside with less volatility than a single-stock position, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outpaced its blended benchmark—the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—with returns exceeding 91% since inception. Also, see – S&P 500 Losers: From Lululemon To MGM — What Went Wrong? Western Digital’s stock climbed 15% last week on a strong earnings print and upbeat guidance for the coming quarters. WDC has nearly doubled in 2025, riding the AI wave as its high-performance storage is critical for AI data centers. At $93, WDC trades at about 2x trailing revenues, modestly above its five-year average P/S of 1.7x. The relative discount to its historical average, as well as some peers, reflects its heavier exposure to the more volatile NAND segment, recent market drawdowns, and historical concerns about earnings cyclicality. Broadcom advanced 13% last week, buoyed by strong quarterly results and news of a new $10 billion custom AI chip order from a major customer—seen as a meaningful accelerant to revenue growth. Our recent analysis — AVGO Stock To $400 — outlines how Broadcom could potentially double again after a 135% gain over the last twelve months. The company is leveraging deep semiconductor expertise to deliver bespoke AI hardware for hyperscale, cloud, and enterprise buyers. Seagate shares rose 12%, supported by expectations for sustained AI-driven storage demand, with the stock up 115% year to date. The enthusiasm for high-capacity drives used in AI workloads has pushed STX’s valuation, now at 4x trailing revenues—well above its five-year average of 1.9x. That premium suggests the market is pricing in elevated demand and earnings durability. Micron gained 10%, largely on rising demand for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) in AI infrastructure. Micron’s revenue multiple is 3.9x, close to its five-year average, implying today’s pricing reflects both current strength and cyclical risks—particularly as DRAM has entered an upcycle after a tough 2024, while NAND remains subdued. Even so, Micron may be AI’s best bargain. Google advanced 10% after a key regulatory win—a federal court found it wouldn’t need to divest Chrome, a platform we estimate is worth over a trillion to the ecosystem. The stock still appears relatively undervalued versus peers, with potential for an additional trillion-dollar upswing if further rulings are favorable; another decision due on September 10 could shape the next move. Remember, investing in a single stock—or a small handful—carries meaningful risk. Consider the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, a 30-stock collection that has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why? As a group, HQ names have delivered better returns with less volatility versus the benchmark—less of a roller-coaster ride—visible in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Major U.S. equities indexes lost ground Friday after the Bureau of Labor Statistics released its latest employment report. The data showed the U.S. added fewer-than-expected jobs in August, and a downward revision to earlier estimates revealed the economy shed jobs in June, the first month of losses since 2020. The S&P 500 slid 0.3% on the final day of the holiday-shortened trading week. The Dow was down 0.5%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq ended the session with a fractional loss of less than 0.1%. Lululemon Athletica (LULU) shares fell the most of any stock in the S&P 500 on Friday, plummeting 18.6%. The maker of athletic apparel posted softer-than-expected same-store sales growth for its fiscal second quarter and trimmed its full-year revenue guidance, pointing to tariff impacts and sluggish U.S. sales. Jefferies analysts suggested Lululemon could face even tougher conditions ahead, citing competitive pressures and doubts about the company's pipeline of new designs. Shares of Kenvue (KVUE) dropped 9.4% after The Wall Street Journal reported the Department of Health and Human Services, under the leadership of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., plans to release a report suggesting a link between autism and pregnant women's use of Tylenol. The popular over-the-counter painkiller is made by Kenvue subsidiary McNeil Consumer Healthcare. A Kenvue spokesperson on Friday contested the claims allegedly made by the report. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares tumbled 6.6% after Seaport Research downgraded the chipmaker's stock to "hold" from "buy." Analysts pointed to signs of slowing demand for AMD's artificial intelligence accelerators, and noted it could become difficult for the company to meet lofty expectations. Broadcom (AVGO) shares surged 9.4%, logging the top performance in the S&P 500, after the chipmaker reported better-than-expected sales and adjusted profit for its fiscal third quarter. Demand for AI semiconductors boosted Broadcom's performance, with AI revenue rising 63% year-over-year. The company also said it had secured $10 billion in orders from a new customer, which reports later suggested was OpenAI. Shares of pool equipment supplier Pool Corp. (POOL) advanced 5.5% after Friday's weak jobs report cemented the case for an interest rate cut at the Federal Reserve's policy meeting later this month. Expectations of a rate cut caused the 10-year Treasury yield, which influences mortgage rates, to sink to its lowest level since April. Elevated mortgage rates have kept the U.S. housing market in a deep freeze for the last three years, which has dragged on the businesses of homebuilders and home goods producers like Pool. Tesla (TSLA) proposed a new compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk that could be worth roughly $1 trillion. Reaching that amount would require the electric vehicle maker's CEO and world's richest person to achieve certain performance targets, including helping Tesla reach a market cap of $8.5 trillion and a total of 20 million vehicle deliveries. Negotiations around Musk's compensation have grown contentious in the past, and shareholders are set to vote on the proposed package on Nov. 6. Tesla stock added 3.7% Friday.

U.S. equities turned lower at midday following the government's weaker-than-expected August employment report. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq were down. Lululemon Athletica (LULU) was the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 after the fashion athletic apparel retailer reported lower-than-anticipated comparable store sales on soft demand in the U.S., and cut its guidance on higher costs relating to new tariffs and the removal of the de minimus exemption for lower-priced imports. Shares of Copart (CPRT) dipped when the online auto auctioneer missed revenue estimates as vehicle sales declined. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares fell on a downgrade from Seaport Research, which pointed to concerns about the chipmaker's AI accelerator business. Broadcom (AVGO) was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 after the software maker posted better-than-anticipated results and said it had a new $10 billion customer. Speculation is that the customer is AI giant OpenAI. Shares of Tesla (TSLA) rose when the electric vehicle maker offered CEO Elon Musk a 10-year pay package that could be worth $1 trillion. Docusign (DOCU) shares jumped when the electronic signature software firm beat profit and sales estimates and raised its outlook as larger customers were using its AI products. Oil futures sank. Gold prices advanced. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note dropped. The U.S. dollar lost ground to the euro, pound, and yen. Most major cryptocurrencies traded higher.

U.S. stocks swung sharply lower Friday after a surprisingly weak August jobs report reinforced the case for a Federal Reserve rate cut at its September 17 meeting. Stocks initially surged on the prospect of cheaper borrowing costs but quickly reversed as investors digested the economic slowdown behind the Fed’s likely pivot.

Title: Broadcom CEO Stands Alongside Steve Jobs In Memorability, Says Analyst As He Hikes Target Price To $415

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. The AI narrative is alive and kicking vigorously. If anyone were still in doubt, the recent pristine earnings print from Broadcom (AVGO) should have laid to rest any lingering consternation on that count. Broadcom, which has gained particular prominence in recent years for designing AI-specific ASICs and accelerators, reported a 22 percent year-over-year increase in revenue for its fiscal Q3 2025 to $15.95 billion, beating the consensus estimate of $15.83 billion. It also beat consensus expectations for EPS by reporting a $1.69 print. So far this year, Broadcom has launched the Tomahawk Ultra networking chip, which is an Ethernet switch chip designed for intra-data-center connectivity, and a next-gen Jericho networking chip, which is a purpose-built Ethernet router for large-scale, distributed AI clusters. Critically, Broadcom's AI semiconductor revenue surged by 63 percent year-over-year to $5.2 billion. And, completing its trifecta of beats, the company raised its guidance for Q4, now projecting total revenue of $17.4 billion and AI semiconductor revenue of $6.2 billion. It is hardly a surprise, therefore, that Melius Research's Ben Reitzes just termed Broadcom's recent earnings call as "the most bullish and memorable call" he can remember, hiking Broadcom's stock price target to $415 per share. Do note that Broadcom's surging AI semiconductor revenues remain at the heart of this nascent bullish shock, delivered with a crispness only someone of Tan's experience could have managed. Elsewhere, we came to know that OpenAI could spend $10 billion on designing an ASIC with Broadcom next year, as per a report by Financial Times. This aligns with a new $10 billion contract that Broadcom's CEO revealed during this week's earnings call. Goldman Sachs commented on this development in the following words: "We believe the most significant development was Broadcom's announcement that it has converted another new custom silicon customer focused on inference, which is expected to help drive "material" upside to management's prior expectation of AI Semiconductor revenue growth of ~60% in 2026."

Broadcom (AVGO) is helping ChatGPT maker OpenAI design and make its first-ever AI chip, according to reports. The partnership would help Broadcom challenge Nvidia's (NVDA) dominance as an AI leader. Shares in Broadcom, which last night posted fiscal third-quarter results that topped estimates Thursday on record revenue, are soaring 15% in early trading Friday, lifted by the results and the OpenAI news. Speculation about a big new customer the company disclosed last night without identifying it also helped the stock. The Financial Times, citing "people familiar with the matter," said that OpenAI was the customer that committed to $10 billion in orders Broadcom CEO Hock Tan referred to during last night's conference call. Citi analysts in a note also said they believe OpenAI was that customer. Broadcom and OpenAI didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. OpenAI will initially use the new chip for its own internal purposes, the FT reported, with shipments beginning next year, according to the FT and Bloomberg. OpenAI, which currently uses chips from Nvidia, is following the path of other big tech firms like Meta Platforms (META), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet’s (GOOGL) in moving to create AI chips in-house. Broadcom's quarterly results are the latest to show sustained demand for AI hardware following earnings from Nvidia (NVDA) last week, and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) last month. The company's shares have gained more than 50% so far this year. UPDATE—This article has been updated with the latest share price information.

Title: Broadcom: AVGO Stock’s Path To $600
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/05/broadcom-avgo-stocks-path-to-600/
Time Published: 2025-09-05T10:26:13Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Broadcom's stock (NASDAQ: AVGO) is climbing, buoyed by impressive quarterly earnings and a new customer win for its custom AI chips. Adding to the optimism, the company expects revenue growth to speed up next year. It's no surprise, then, that the stock has more than doubled in the past twelve months. But what could fuel another 100% gain to levels past $600 from here? We’ll explore the key factors that could push the stock to new heights in the analysis that follows. That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Separately, see – S&P 500 Index To Crash 8%? Broadcom’s growth is anchored by its custom AI chip partnerships with top hyperscalers, namely Google (for its TPU) and Meta. In a significant development on September 4, 2025, the company announced it has secured a fourth major, unnamed customer for its custom AI accelerators (XPUs), reportedly worth $10 billion. This diversifies its revenue and solidifies its role as a key enabler for large-scale AI infrastructure. While the initial AI boom focused on training, the market is now shifting to inference, where Broadcom holds a strategic advantage. As AI applications are deployed at scale, the demand for high-performance, power-efficient inference chips and networking skyrockets. Broadcom's expertise in specialized networking and processing is critical for these workloads, positioning it to capture this massive market segment. Broadcom maintains its competitive edge through relentless product innovation. It is now shipping its Tomahawk 6 and Tomahawk Ultra networking chips, which significantly outperform their predecessor and are essential for building out large AI clusters. Furthermore, its leadership in co-packaged silicon photonics is a key technology for next-generation data centers, enabling the faster, more efficient data transfer required for advanced AI. Notably, the Tomahawk Ultra can connect up to 1,024 accelerators in a single rack, significantly more than NVIDIA’s NVLink Switch, which only supports up to 72 GPUs. Beyond hardware, the acquisition of VMware has transformed Broadcom into a major infrastructure software company. Broadcom is successfully transitioning VMware customers to subscription models and streamlining the portfolio. This strategy is already boosting recurring revenue and is expected to generate substantial, stable cash flow, significantly improving the company’s overall profit margins. For perspective, VMware, which is part of Broadcom’s infrastructure software segment, saw its revenue surge 43% y-o-y to $6.8 billion in Q3 fiscal 2025 (fiscal period ends in October). For Broadcom's stock to double in value, it relies on a powerful combination of substantial earnings growth and a sustained, premium valuation from investors. The pathway is built on two core pillars: The foundation for growth is a strong top-line forecast. We project Broadcom’s revenue could grow from around $60 billion in the last twelve months to more than $105 billion by 2028, driven primarily by its AI and VMware segments. However, the key is Broadcom's exceptional profitability. With adjusted net income margins around 50%, revenue growth has a magnified impact on the bottom line. This means earnings are positioned to grow significantly faster than sales. For example, if revenue increases by 75% over the next few years, the company's adjusted earnings per share (EPS) could nearly double from around $6.29 now to $12 in 2028. Earnings growth alone isn't enough; the stock must also maintain its high valuation multiple. Broadcom has been trading at a premium valuation of over 50 times trailing adjusted earnings for several reasons: If investors continue to assign a premium multiple of around 50x to the stock, an EPS of $12 would support a stock price of around $600. Furthermore, the multiple could expand even further if Broadcom demonstrates sustained AI revenue growth above 40%, captures more market share, and secures new large-scale customers. Despite the strong growth outlook, several risks could impact Broadcom's performance and valuation. Broadcom's AI revenue is highly dependent on a small number of hyperscale customers. While profitable, this concentration creates a significant risk; a change in spending plans or a strategic shift from even one major customer could disproportionately impact Broadcom's revenue. Any broader slowdown in the rapid pace of AI infrastructure investment would also directly threaten the company's primary growth engine. The market for AI chips and networking solutions is intensely competitive. Broadcom faces pressure from established rivals like Marvell and NVIDIA, as well as the risk of its own hyperscale customers developing more of their in-house silicon solutions. This competition could compress the high profit margins that currently justify Broadcom's premium valuation. Broadcom's stock has historically shown higher volatility during broad market downturns compared to the S&P 500. It experienced steeper declines during both the COVID-19 correction and the 2022 inflation shock. This indicates a heightened sensitivity to macroeconomic uncertainty, and a future economic slowdown or market disruption could lead to a significant drop in its stock price. Over the next few years, Broadcom's stock could double to over $600. The path to this 2x return is straightforward: the company must achieve the forecasted revenue and earnings growth while convincing the market that its premium valuation is sustainable. However, investors considering this opportunity should also weigh the risks. The stock has experienced drops of up to 50% in the past, and they must be prepared for similar volatility. Despite this, for those with an investment horizon of three years or more, Broadcom's stock has a strong potential to double from its current level. See, there always remains a meaningful risk when investing in a single, or just a handful of stocks. Consider the 30-stock Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: How To Earn $500 A Month From Broadcom Stock Ahead Of Q3 Earnings

Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime. Broadcom Inc. AVGO will release earnings results for the third quarter after the closing bell on Thursday, Sept. 4. Analysts expect the tech company to report quarterly earnings at $1.65 per share, up from $1.24 per share in the year-ago period. Broadcom projects to report quarterly revenue at $15.83 billion, compared to $13.07 billion a year earlier, according to data from Benzinga Pro. The company has beaten analyst estimates for revenue in two straight quarters and in eight of the last 10 quarters overall. Some investors are eyeing potential gains from Broadcom's annual dividend yield of 0.78%. That’s a quarterly dividend amount of 59 cents per share ($2.36 a year). To earn $500 monthly from Broadcom, start with the yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months). Next, we take this amount and divide it by Broadcom's $2.36 dividend: $6,000 / $2.36 = 2,542 shares. So, an investor would need to own approximately $768,675 worth of Broadcom, or 2,542 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500. Assuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 / $2.36 = 508 shares, or $153,614 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100. Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis; the dividend payment and the stock price fluctuate over time. The dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change. For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its current price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40). Further, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same. Similarly, if a company decreases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will decrease. AVGO Price Action: Shares of Broadcom rose by 1.4% to close at $302.39 on Wednesday.
