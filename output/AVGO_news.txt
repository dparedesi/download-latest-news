Title: How AMD, Nvidia, Broadcom Can Ride Oracle’s $455B Cloud Surge

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. On Monday, during its earnings announcement, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) delivered a striking revelation that surprised even the most optimistic analysts. The company’s remaining performance obligations (RPO) for its cloud division surged 359% year-over-year, reaching $455 billion, compared to only $138 billion in the previous quarter. This astonishing increase caused Oracle’s stock to rise nearly 36% in Wednesday’s trading, marking its largest single-day gain in many years. Consider RPO as Oracle’s guaranteed revenue stream—contracts that have already been finalized and are just pending execution. This is not speculative thinking or hopeful forecasts; it represents money that customers have already committed. CEO Safra Catz stated that Oracle anticipates securing several additional multi-billion-dollar customers soon, pushing its RPO beyond the half-trillion-dollar threshold within months. Here’s a brief overview of how the major AI silicon players will reap benefits from Oracle’s significant initiative. How Oracle Stock Surges 3x To $900? For Oracle, turning these obligations into revenue hinges on the speed at which it can expand its infrastructure. This necessitates electricity, regulatory approvals, and high-performance GPUs, all of which are still in persistent global shortage. The corporation also increased its capital expenditure projection to $35 billion for fiscal 2026—a 65% rise that highlights the urgency of its AI infrastructure expansion. It’s no surprise that this exceptional guidance caused shares of Nvidia, Broadcom, and AMD to climb between 2% and 10%, as these chip manufacturers form the foundation of nearly every AI implementation. Each additional Oracle contract should correspond to increased demand for their semiconductors. Furthermore, in contrast to cloud competitors like Google, AWS, or Microsoft, Oracle is not developing its own bespoke AI chips. Instead, it has relied on GPUs from Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD). Oracle maintains a robust partnership with AI compute standard bearer Nvidia, which provides most of the GPUs currently utilized in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. Oracle stands out among hyperscalers by offering so-called “bare metal” instances alongside Nvidia GPUs. This affords customers direct, exclusive access to high-end physical chips like A10, A100, H100, H200, and the flagship Blackwell chips, eliminating virtualization overhead. Such a setup enables businesses to optimize performance for model training and inference. Oracle’s AI supercomputers deploy these GPUs in densely packed, liquid-cooled data centers engineered for energy efficiency and throughput. This close collaboration allows Oracle to cater to some of the most sophisticated AI applications globally at scale. Nvidia GPUs have been the backbone of Oracle’s AI infrastructure, and this partnership may prove vital as Oracle carries out its extensive AI contracts in the upcoming years. Nvidia Stock To Fall 50% As AI Cycle Turns? Oracle has also been diversifying away from solely relying on Nvidia. In June, Oracle and AMD revealed that the AMD Instinct MI355X GPUs would be available on OCI, providing more than double the price-performance of the previous generation. Oracle plans to deploy as many as 131,072 MI355X GPUs, empowering enterprises to build, train, and perform inference on massive AI models with competitive economics. This collaboration guarantees that AMD will secure a significant portion of Oracle’s AI expenditures. The MI355X, based on AMD’s new CDNA 4 architecture and TSMC’s 3nm process, marks AMD’s most significant advancement yet in AI accelerators. For Oracle, this strategy broadens its hardware alternatives, diminishes reliance on a single supplier, and is expected to enhance negotiation leverage with Nvidia for GPUs, thereby controlling overall spending. Oracle’s revenue outlook is increasingly linked to AI inference, which involves executing trained models at scale for real-time user queries. Buy or Sell AVGO Stock at $360? As AI transitions from development to widespread use, inference workloads are likely to significantly exceed training requirements, resulting in a recurring, utility-like demand stream. This is precisely where Broadcom and its custom application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) could emerge as substantial beneficiaries. While GPUs are predominant in training, inference at scale is expected to increasingly favor custom chips that provide better cost and energy efficiency. While Oracle still primarily utilizes GPUs for AI tasks, it appears that ASICs will undoubtedly play a more substantial role moving forward. This trend helps clarify why Broadcom’s stock surged nearly 10% on Wednesday—surpassing the gains of Nvidia and AMD, which increased by 2% to 4%—as investors speculate that Broadcom’s custom chips will capture part of Oracle’s workload. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising 30 stocks, has a demonstrated track record of consistently outperforming its benchmark, including the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap. What drives this? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have produced superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index, delivering a smoother experience, as reflected in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Watch These Broadcom Price Levels After Stock's Recent Rally on AI Optimism

Broadcom (AVGO) shares rallied to an all-time high this week as the chipmaker positions itself as a key competitor to AI favorite Nvidia (NVDA). The stock surged nearly 10% to a record close near $370 Wednesday, before pulling back slightly in Thursday's session. They've added more than half their value since the start of the year, with a close to 20% gain over the past five days alone, boosted by the company’s strong quarterly results, a new $10 billion customer, and the resurgence of the AI trade after Oracle (ORCL) reported a massive increase in its backlog. In a note to clients on Monday, Melius Research analysts said they expect Broadcom could gain about 30% of the AI compute market, while Nvidia’s market share falls over time. Below, we break down the technicals on Broadcom’s weekly chart and identify key price levels to watch after the stock’s recent bullish run. After retracing just below the 50-week moving average in March, Broadcom shares have staged an impressive reversal, with gains accelerating recently after the chipmaker’s quarterly results. While above-average trading volume has signaled buying conviction, the relative strength index warns of overbought conditions, with the indicator reaching a level that preceded major consolidation phases in the stock during late 2021 and mid-2023. Let’s use technical analysis to forecast how a long-term uptrend for Broadcom could play out, and also identify support levels worth watching during potential retracements. Investors can use bars pattern analysis to project a potential bullish price target and speculate how high the stock could go from here. When applying the technique to Broadcom’s chart, we take the stock’s uptrend from May 2023 to June 2024 and overlay it from the start of last week’s bullish move. This indicates a period of consolidation for several months before a possible rally toward $680 by October next year, if price action rhymes with the prior trend. The earlier trend began with two weekly price bars that delivered a combined gain of 27%, compared to the over 20% cumulative advance of the two most recent weekly bars. During potential pullbacks in the stock, it’s initially worth tracking the $250 level. This area on the chart may provide support near the stock’s December and January twin peaks. Selling below this level could see the Broadcom shares revisit lower support around $185. Investors may seek entry points in this location near the upper range of a consolidation period that formed on the chart between June and November last year.
