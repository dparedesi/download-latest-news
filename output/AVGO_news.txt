Netflix (NFLX) is slated to report first-quarter results after markets close Thursday, and options markets suggest traders are expecting a big stock price move in the following days. Netflix options pricing on Wednesday signaled the stock is expected to move approximately 8.5% in either direction in the week after Thursday’s report, suggesting a stock-price range of between $893.47 and $1,059.09. (U.S. financial markets are closed on Friday, which means any big move in the stock won't happen until next week.) Uncertainty is high heading into Netflix’s report, and that uneasiness is reflected in options prices for nearly all stocks. “The market is pricing in the highest average implied moves since 1Q20,” wrote JPMorgan analysts in a note on Monday. By their calculations, the average implied earnings-day move for the stocks they cover is 8.1% this quarter, compared with a realized average of 6.5% last quarter and 5.9% over the last three years. In the same note, JPMorgan compared the historical post-earnings moves of the 60 largest S&P 500 stocks and their implied volatility this quarter. They found Netflix was among the stocks with the most underestimated—or "cheapest"—post-earnings volatility. Over the past three years, the stock’s post-earnings move has averaged about 11%, making it and Meta Platforms (META) the most volatile names in JPMorgan's sample. Netflix's "cheap" implied volatility puts it in the minority. Traders are pricing in smaller-than-average moves for only nine of the 60 largest stocks in the S&P 500, according to JPMorgan's analysis. Tech giants Nvidia (NVDA), Meta, Broadcom (AVGO) and Oracle (ORCL) are among those nine. Netflix stock has jumped following each of its last two earnings reports. Shares advanced nearly 10% the day after fourth-quarter earnings topped estimates in January. The company also raised its revenue forecast for 2025 and boosted its share buyback program by $15 billion. In October of last year, Netflix beat expectations for its top and bottom lines, and indicated strong demand for its ad-supported subscription tier, sending shares soaring more than 11% the next day. Netflix stock popped on Tuesday after a report that the streaming giant is aiming to double its revenue to about $78 billion by 2030, an ambitious goal that the company hopes will propel it into the $1 trillion market-capitalization club alongside tech giants like Alphabet (GOOG) and Amazon (AMZN). Analysts are generally bullish on Netflix stock heading into earnings. Oppenheimer on Monday stuck by its “buy” rating and $1,150 price target—among the highest on Wall Street—and expressed confidence the streamer will be mostly insulated from tariffs and an economic slowdown. Netflix shares fell 1.5% on Wednesday amid a broad sell-off. Even with the decline, the company's shares are up about 8% so far this year and have risen 56% over the past 12 months.

More Lucas via AFP) (Photo by RICCARDO MILANI/Hans Lucas/AFP via Getty Images) Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ: AVGO) stock has risen 12% over the past five days due to two key developments: a broader market rebound after President Trump suspended reciprocal tariffs for 90 days, and the company’s announcement of a $10 billion share buyback program. Despite the recent gains, AVGO is still down over 20% this year. Such fluctuations are not unusual for the stock—AVGO fell 36% during the 2022 inflation-driven downturn and dropped 48% during the COVID-19-related market selloff in 2020. However, for investors seeking a potentially more stable and high-performing alternative, consider the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, which includes 30 stocks with a strong record of consistently outperforming the S&P 500 over the past four years. Broadcom’s key financial indicators highlight its strong foundation: For long-term investors, the recent decline in AVGO stock could offer a compelling entry point, considering the company’s solid fundamentals and AI leadership. Those sensitive to volatility should consider hedging, consulting a financial advisor, or diversification, such as the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark to produce strong returns for investors.
