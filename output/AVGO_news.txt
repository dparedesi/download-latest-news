Investing JPMorgan just reiterated an outperform rating on Amazon, noting that the dip is an opportunity. Sending You to Google News in 3 © 24/7 Wall St. It’s always a good idea to keep track of analysts’ stock upgrades. Often, they’re influenced by (1) company fundamentals, such as financial health, future growth, and even meetings with management; (2) industry and market trends, including specific market conditions and economics; (3) earnings and financial data, including earnings reports that came in better than expected, or competitive analysis of a competitor, and (4) guidance. However, before jumping into a stock just because your favorite analyst upgraded it, do your own due diligence, fundamentally and technically. That being said, here are a few heavy-hitters seeing upgrades. JPMorgan just reiterated an outperform rating on Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN). The firm says the dip is an opportunity, noting that shares re-traced to pre-earnings levels and are now about 10% off November highs. Just yesterday, Goldman Sachs reiterated its buy rating on Amazon, noting that it’s well-positioned for the holidays. Not long ago, analysts at KeyBanc Capital said Amazon should benefit from the AI boom. The analysts say Amazon’s AWS is still growing strong. It also believes that the ramp of gigawatt data center clusters and customers like Anthropic are potential drivers of revenue acceleration into 2026. The analysts have an overweight rating on AMZN with a $300 price target. Heading into earnings next week, Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) just saw a price target hike from Goldman Sachs. With a new target of $435, up from $380, the firm expects to see further sustained strength in artificial intelligence. It also expects to see updated 2026 AI revenue guidance above 100% year-over-year. “The analyst sees AI revenue for fiscal year 2026 to come in at $45.4 billion, marking an approximate year-over-year rise of 128%. This could reach $77.3 billion in 2027, rising 70% year over year,” added CNBC. Analysts at Raymond James also resumed their outperform rating on Broadcom. With a price target of $420 a share, the firm “cited Broadcom’s position as a share gainer in the AI sector, providing operators with customized alternatives to general-purpose processors. Raymond James expects continued upward estimate revisions to support its positive rating on the stock,” as noted by Investing.com. Analysts at Piper Sandler upgraded Oscar Health (NYSE: OSCR) to an overweight rating with a price target of $25 from $13. The firm noted that with enhanced premium tax credits (E-APTCs) expiring at the end of the year, OSCR’s market share and margins should expand. “If the E-APTCs are allowed to expire at the end of CY25, OSCR believes Individual ACA Marketplace enrollment could decline (20.0%) to (30.0%) in CY26. This projection implies that the Individual ACA Market sheds ~6.1M lives y/y; with enrollment collapsing from ~24.3M in CY25 to ~18.2M in CY26,” said the firm, as quoted by CNBC. “It reflects the confluence of expiring E-APTCs and federal efforts to strengthen program integrity.” Latest Podcast Episode Amazon Strikes Back, And A Surprise $10,000 Portfolio Buy 38 min See us invest in our favorite AI stock ideas for free Nov 9, 2025 Live Nov 4, 2025 Analysts are doubling down on market leaders, with fresh upgrades for Nvidia, AMD, Walmart, Amazon, and Broadcom.

The gloom that has hung over Wall Street in recent weeks showed signs of dissipating on Monday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was up about 2.4% in recent trading, leading the major indexes higher after lagging during Friday’s rally. Big tech shares and many of Wall Street’s favorite AI stocks were among Monday’s top gainers, with chipmakers Broadcom (AVGO) and Micron (MU) each up more than 7% and all of the Magnificent Seven stocks in the green. Dip-buying retail investors may be partly responsible. Money poured into S&P 500 exchange-traded funds last week while the index slumped, according to a UBS note, while ETF inflows as a percent of assets under management climbed to their highest level this year—both signs, the analysts wrote, of individual-investor optimism. And inflows into leveraged funds accelerated throughout the sell-off, according to Deutsche Bank analysts, another potential sign of retail's confidence. There are signs of improving investor sentiment, particularly among retail investors, heading into the Thanksgiving holiday. Retail investor behavior often reflects market sentiment, or vibes, as they usually lack the detailed market data and sophisticated algorithms of institutional investors. Sentiment is itself one of the main drivers of stock market returns. Stocks sold off last week as concerns about an AI bubble and uncertainty about the trajectory of monetary policy weighed on sentiment. The S&P 500 lost nearly 2% and the Nasdaq dropped 2.7%. Equity positioning turned underweight—indicating caution—for the first time since July, according to Deutsche Bank. Chief among investors’ concerns was whether the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates next month. Signs of a weakening labor market argue for a cut, while evidence that inflation is accelerating well above the Fed's 2% target could drive caution. Rate-cut expectations jumped all over the place last week. The September jobs report—the last piece of official labor market data policymakers are likely to see before they meet—sent mixed signals, causing expectations to plummet. But they rebounded Friday when one Fed official indicated he was open to cutting. As of Monday, market participants put the odds of a December rate cut at about 77%, up from just 30% last Wednesday. Investors are also debating whether the AI boom that’s fueled the bull market is a perilous bubble. A stronger-than-expected earnings report from chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) last week wasn’t enough to put those fears to bed. AI stocks continued to slump following the report, and many missed out on Friday’s rally entirely. Calm returned to markets Monday. The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), known as Wall Street's “Fear Index,” recently stood at about 21, a tick above the level associated with smooth sailing for stocks. And CNN’s Fear & Greed index, which tracks seven market metrics to gauge the prevailing sentiment among investors, looked less scary after notching its most pessimistic reading since early April. Last week's AAII Sentiment Survey of individual investors, meanwhile, also showed a slightly more optimistic outlook than seen a week earlier, when nearly half of respondents were bearish. Economic data this week could test that calm. Investors will be watching jobless claims data on Wednesday for a clearer picture of the state of the job market. And the Producer Price Index for September, due Tuesday, should fill out the Fed's picture of inflation; it's likely to be the last inflation data released before the Fed makes its rate decision.
