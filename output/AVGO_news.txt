Title: 6 Vanguard Index Funds To Buy Now

Time Published: 2025-03-03T21:33:34Z

Whether you're building a new&nbsp;ETF portfolio or enhancing an existing one, Vanguard index funds ... [+] are worth a look. Experienced and novice investors love Vanguard index funds. In October 2024, Morningstar estimated Vanguard had a leading 29% market share in U.S. assets under management. Let's explore what makes this fund family so popular and meet six Vanguard funds performing well against their peers. Many investors choose Vanguard index funds for their low expense ratios and attractive market exposures. The Vanguard name is also well-regarded as the original index fund manager—the company launched the first index fund in 1976. A fund's expense ratio quantifies how much shareholders pay for the fund's administrative costs. Fund expenses dilute returns, so a lower ratio is better. Index funds normally have low expense ratios because they are cheaper to operate than actively managed funds. Vanguard is proudly a low-cost provider of this already cost-efficient investment product. In February 2025, the company lowered expense ratios across 87 funds. Vanguard estimates the reduction will save investors $350 million in 2025. One strategy to identify the best and cheapest Vanguard index funds is to screen on expense ratios and Morningstar Ratings. The Morningstar Rating is a comparative measure of a fund’s risk-adjusted returns. A five-star rating, the highest possible, indicates a fund has historically performed well against its peers. Note that Morningstar re-rates funds monthly, and ratings do not guarantee future performance. See Morningstar Ratings 101 for more information. As of late February 2025, nine Vanguard funds had five-star ratings. Those nine funds were ordered from lowest expense ratio to highest. The top six were selected for inclusion. The table below includes six Vanguard funds with five-star Morningstar Ratings and expense ratios below 0.10%. Ratings are from Morningstar and fund metrics are from Vanguard.com. For more fund investing ideas, see best ETFs for 2025 and income investing ETFs. Vanguard's S&P 500 ETF invests in every S&P 500 company. The fund's goal is to replicate the performance of the S&P 500 index, commonly used as a benchmark for the entire stock market. VOO’s predecessor was Vanguard's First Index Investment Trust, launched in 1976. Today, VOO is the world's largest ETF with $1.4 trillion in net assets. VOO has the elements of a solid core holding: The 0.03% expense ratio is cost-efficient, and the portfolio provides exposure to an appealing segment. The S&P 500 includes the largest, most successful companies on U.S. stock exchanges. The index can be volatile but has historically delivered a long-term annualized return of 7% net of inflation. Vanguard's mega-cap fund tracks the CRSP US Mega Cap Index. The index includes 195 of the largest U.S. companies by market capitalization. Historically, large companies were often more stable and predictable than their smaller counterparts. For that reason, many conservative equity investors favored mega-cap and blue-chip stocks. That trend has changed. Today, technology companies dominate market-cap-weighted indexes. For example, AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA)—a stock known for its volatility—is the third largest company in the S&P 500 and the CRSP US Mega Cap Index. Still, the MGC portfolio offers an interesting collection of stocks. The holdings include growth players like Nvidia and Microsoft (MSFT), alongside value plays like Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM). You get these same top stocks in an S&P 500 fund but with less concentration. Head-to-head, the mega-cap index outperforms the S&P 500 slightly, albeit with more volatility. The Vanguard Mega Cap Value ETF replicates the CRSP US Mega Cap Value Index. The index includes the largest value stocks, covering about 70% of U.S. market capitalization. There are 136 index constituents. The value focus of MGV should appeal to bargain-hunting, risk-averse equity investors. You won’t find too many fast-moving tech stocks in this portfolio. The fund favors financials, health care and industrials. The technology sector is represented but by less prominent stocks such as Broadcom (AVGO), IBM (IBM) and Qualcomm (QCOM). Relative to VOO, MGV has produced slightly lower returns. The fund does deliver a reasonable yield of 2.06%, so it might be a candidate for those who favor dividend ETFs. Vanguard's VONG fund invests in Russell 1000 Growth stocks. This index currently includes 395 Russell 1000 stocks with higher price-to-book ratios, higher two-year earnings forecasts and higher five-year sales-per-share growth. VONG provides nice return potential by focusing on stocks with growth characteristics. The earnings growth rate for this portfolio is 24.9%. The same metric for VOO is 18.9%. This fund has outperformed the others on this list, with a five-year average annual return of 18.82%. High concentrations of Apple (AAPL), Microsoft, Nvidia and Amazon (AMZN) have driven much of that growth. One trade-off for the appreciation potential is lower cash returns. VONG's 30-day SEC yield is 0.48%. Vanguard's health care fund invests in about 400 large, mid and small cap companies that provide medical products, services or technology. The benchmark index is the MSCI US IMI Health Care 25/50. According to a Deloitte survey in December 2024, health care industry leaders are mostly optimistic about the year ahead. Nearly 70% of survey respondents expect a 2025 revenue increase and 71% expect a boost in profits. VHT is a good position for capitalizing on higher health care profits. Like all funds on this list, VHT has performed well against peers. It also has a low expense ratio of 0.09% and pays a moderate SEC 30-day yield of 1.38%. The portfolio includes Zepbound-maker Eli Lilly (LLY), diversified health care company UnitedHealth (UNH) and biopharma Abbvie (ABBV). Vanguard's technology ETF holds large, mid and small tech stocks, including hardware and software providers and semiconductor companies. The benchmark index is MSCI US IMI Info Technology 25/50. AI has fueled a surge in tech stocks over the last two years. Many experts believe the trend will continue. According to The Wall Street Journal, AI spending is projected to grow at a compound annual rate of 29% between 2024 and 2028. VGT provides broad exposure to the technology sector, from Nvidia and other big names to exciting mid-caps like Astera Labs (ALAB). Note that the fund is market-cap-weighted, so the mega caps will drive the overall performance. That could be good or bad, depending on your outlook and risk tolerance. Bottom Line Whether you're building a new ETF portfolio or enhancing an existing one, Vanguard index funds are worth a look. They have low fees and cover popular market segments, broad to niche. You can double-down on growth, find value bargains or tweak your sector exposure. It’s no wonder Vanguard is the most popular fund family in the U.S.

Nvidia (NVDA-0.97%), Super Micro Computer (SMCI-1.05%), and Dell (DELL+1.90%) shares plunged Monday after Singapore said it’s investigating whether servers shipped to Malaysia containing chips barred from China ended up in the mainland. Police in the city-state arrested several people for their alleged roles in procuring and shipping Nvidia chips in violation of American sanctions, Bloomberg reports. The U.S. has been investigating whether Chinese AI startup DeepSeek had circumvented curbs that way, it said earlier. Singapore is seeking further information from Malaysia and the U.S. to determine the final destination of the Dell and Super Micro Computer servers, Law Minister K. Shanmugam told reporters on Monday. The purchasers had misled suppliers about the ultimate destination of the equipment, he said. The investigation risks increasing U.S. scrutiny of equipment exports by the American companies, a potential drag on sales growth. The news also comes amid investor caution ahead of the scheduled implementation of higher U.S. tariffs on goods from China, Mexico and Canada. Nvidia stock closed down 8.7% on Monday. Super Micro shares fell 13%, and Dell slipped 7%. Intel (INTC-4.64%) stock closed down 4.2%, giving giving up a gain earlier in the day driven by a report that its faltering chip manufacturing business could get a boost from its rivals. Nvidia and Broadcom (AVGO-0.02%) are testing chip manufacturing with Intel on its most advanced 18A process for cutting-edge chips, such as those for AI, Reuters reports. Broadcom, due to report earnings on Thursday, dropped more than 6%. The U.S.-traded shares of top chip foundry Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. (TSM+1.30%) (TSMC) fell 4.2%.

U.S. stocks plunged Monday after the ISM manufacturing index came in lower than expected at 50.3, as new orders contracted and the price measure surged. Investors are also cautious ahead of planned tariffs on Mexico and Canada scheduled to come into effect on Tuesday. The S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average all closed significantly lower. The Dow fell 650 points, or about 1.5%, while the S&P 500 was off 1.8% and the Nasdaq closed down 2.6%. Automakers, among the companies most affected by tariffs, gave up earlier gains and fell after President Trump reiterated that the duties will go into effect tomorrow. Ford (F+3.13%) dropped 1.7%, General Motors (GM+3.65%) declined 3.6% and Stellantis (STLA+6.19%) slipped 3%. All three have plants in Mexico and Canada. Tesla (TSLA-0.75%) fell 2.8%. Nvidia (NVDA-0.74%), Super Micro Computer (SMCI-0.77%), and Dell (DELL+2.02%) shares plunged Monday after Singapore said it’s investigating whether servers shipped to Malaysia containing chips barred from China ended up in the mainland. Stock in Intel (INTC-4.81%), Broadcom (AVGO+0.04%) and TSMC (TSM+1.44%) also declined. Kroger (KR-1.23%) stock fell 2.9% after CEO Rodney McMullen resigned following an investigation into his personal conduct. The grocery chain unveils its earnings report on Thursday. Weyerhaeuser (WY-0.62%) stock gained 4.3% after Trump ordered a probe of lumber imports on national security grounds.

Title: Intel could get a boost from Nvidia and Broadcom

Intel’s (INTC-4.81%) faltering chip manufacturing business could get a boost from its rivals. Nvidia (NVDA-0.74%) and Broadcom (AVGO+0.04%) are testing chip manufacturing with the chip pioneer on its most advanced 18A process for cutting-edge chips, such as those for artificial intelligence, Reuters reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. The tests are being carried out as the two chip designers decide on manufacturing contracts with Intel that could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, according to Reuters — a move that could be a turnaround for Intel’s declining business. Intel’s shares were up by 3.2% during Monday morning trading, and are up by 22% so far this year. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD-1.43%) reportedly also is interested in using Intel for manufacturing, but it is not confirmed if the company is testing chips. An Intel spokesperson told Reuters that it sees “strong interest and engagement on Intel 18A across our ecosystem.” Neither Intel, Broadcom, nor AMD immediately responded to requests for comment. Nvidia declined to comment. In September, Reuters reported that Intel’s tests with Broadcom on its 18A process had failed, after Broadcom’s engineers determined it could not be used for high-volume chip production. The current tests with Nvidia and Broadcom are focused on the viability of Intel’s 18A manufacturing process and are not using finished chip designs, Reuters reported, adding that the tests could take months. In February 2024, Microsoft (MSFT+0.61%) announced that it was tapping Intel’s 18A manufacturing process for a future chip designed in-house. Former Intel chief executive Pat Gelsinger had started Intel’s contract manufacturing business in 2021, but it has not yet secured a major chip designer partner. Intel previously pushed back the 18A process to 2026, but is now delaying it by another six months, Reuters reported, citing supplier documents and unnamed people familiar with the matter. The delay has to do with qualifying intellectual property for the manufacturing process, according to Reuters. Intel told Reuters that it plans to “begin ramping production in the second half of this year, delivering on the commitments we have made to our customers.” Meanwhile, Intel has become an acquisition target for its competitors. Last month, the Wall Street Journal reported that Intel could see its business split in two by separate potential deals with Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM+1.44%). Broadcom is reportedly looking into Intel’s chip design and marketing unit, while TSMC is interested in its chip manufacturing plants.

Super Micro Computer (SMCI-0.77%), a key player in AI hardware, also declined, mirroring Nvidia’s slump. Investors are uncertain about how Trump’s tariffs could shape the future of the AI industry. Shares of Elon Musk’s Tesla (TSLA-0.75%) surged over 3% on Monday after Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas restored the stock as a “Top Pick” in U.S. autos. His price target of $430 per share suggests a potential upside of more than 50% from Tesla’s current share price. Cryptocurrency-related companies and Bitcoin holders, including Coinbase (COIN-0.96%), Strategy (MSTR+4.36%), and Robinhood (HOOD-1.17%), surged Monday following Trump’s announcement of a strategic crypto reserve encompassing Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. — Josh Fellman contributed to the article Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

ANKARA, TURKIYE - MAY 29: In this photo illustration, Broadcom and VMware logos are seen displayed ... [+] on a computer screen in Ankara, Turkiye on May 29, 2024. (Photo by Abdullah Guclu/Anadolu via Getty Images) See More On Trefis.com Broadcom stock (NASDAQ:AVGO) experienced a 7% decline on Thursday, February 27th, as part of a broader selloff affecting chip stocks. This market reaction followed the release of Nvidia’s earnings report and President Trump’s announcement of increased tariffs on China, as well as the imposition of tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, set to take effect next week. Separately, Should You Buy Monster Beverage Stock At $55? After its recent fall, AVGO stock looks attractive but volatile - making it a tricky pick to buy at its current price of around $200. We believe there is minimal cause for concern with AVGO stock, which makes it attractive but highly sensitive to adverse events as its current valuation is extremely high. We arrive at our conclusion by comparing the current valuation of AVGO stock with its operating performance over the recent years as well as its current and historical financial condition. Our analysis of Broadcom along key parameters of Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience shows that the company has a very strong operating performance and financial condition, as detailed below. Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, AVGO stock looks very expensive compared to the broader market. • Broadcom has a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 20.1 vs. a figure of 3.1 for the S&P 500 • Additionally, the company's price-to-operating income (P/EBIT) ratio is 69.0 compared to 24.4 for S&P 500 • And, it has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 51.9 vs. the benchmark’s 24.4 Broadcom's Revenues have grown considerably over recent years. • Broadcom has seen its top line grow at an average rate of 24.3% over the last 3 years (vs. 9.8% for S&P 500) • Its revenues have grown 44.0% from $36 Bil to $52 Bil in the last 12 months (vs. change of 5.6% for S&P 500) • Also, its quarterly revenues grew 51.2% to $14 Bil in the most recent quarter from $9.3 Bil a year ago (vs. 7.2% change for S&P 500) Broadcom's profit margins are much higher than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. • Broadcom's Operating Income over the last four quarters was $15 Bil, which represents a high Operating Margin of 29.1% (vs. 12.6% for S&P 500) • Broadcom’s Operating Cash Flow (OCF) over this period was $20 Bil, pointing to a high OCF-to-Sales Ratio of 38.7% (vs. 14.4% for S&P 500) Broadcom's balance sheet looks strong. • Broadcom's Debt figure was $68 Bil at the end of the most recent quarter, while its market capitalization is $925 Bil (as of 2/27/2025). This implies a strong Debt-to-Equity Ratio of 6.5% (vs. 19.7% for S&P 500). [Note: A lower Debt-to-Equity Ratio is desirable] • Cash (including cash equivalents) makes up $9 billion of the $166 billion in Total Assets for Broadcom. This yields a moderate Cash-to-Assets Ratio of 5.6% (vs. 14.1% for S&P 500) AVGO stock has been more resilient than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy, how bad can things get if there is another recession? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes. • AVGO stock fell 34.8% from a high of $62.71 on 4 January 2022 to $40.86 on 16 October 2022, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 17 May 2023 • Since then, the stock has increased to a high of $249.33 on 16 December 2024 and currently trades at around $200 • AVGO stock fell 46.8% from a high of $27.40 on 19 February 2020 to $14.57 on 18 March 2020, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 5 June 2020 In summary, Broadcom's performance across the parameters detailed above are as follows: • Growth: Extremely Strong • Profitability: Very Strong • Financial Stability: Strong • Downturn Resilience: Strong • Overall: Very Strong Hence, despite its extremely high valuation, the stock appears attractive but volatile, which supports our conclusion that AVGO is a tricky stock to buy. Not too happy about the volatile nature of AVGO stock? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
