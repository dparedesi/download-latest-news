We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Promising Dividend Stocks According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other dividend stocks. During a time of great excitement about AI-driven capital gains, it's crucial to remember that dividends have consistently played a vital role in total returns. Over the long term, dividends become even more significant. Looking back at the past few decades, approximately 55% of market returns from 1987 to the end of 2023 have come from reinvested dividends. Dividends are a long-term investment strategy, and the benefits take time to materialize. For example, a dollar invested in the broader market in 1927 without reinvesting dividends would be worth $243 today, but if dividends were reinvested, that same dollar would be worth $3,737. Fortunately, you don’t need a century to see the potential growth in dividend stocks, as the outlook for the near future is improving. According to a report by AGF Investments, in the second half of 2024, global monetary easing has led to lower bond yields, making fixed income less attractive compared to dividend-paying stocks. In addition, companies with high dividend payouts often have more leverage, and lower bond yields help them manage interest expenses, boosting their overall financial performance, which in turn would contribute to dividend growth. Also read: 8 Unstoppable Dividend Stocks to Invest in According to a report by J.P. Morgan, global equities are on the brink of a significant period of dividend growth, not just due to a cyclical rise in payouts but also because of a more permanent increase in dividend momentum. Over the past two decades, global dividends per share have grown at an annual rate of 5.6%, but J.P. Morgan’s analysts now predict this rate will accelerate to 7.6% in the future. The main factor driving this increased dividend growth is the low starting point for payout ratios (dividends relative to earnings). In 2020, during the pandemic, an unusual number of companies reduced their dividends. In fact, global dividends dropped by 12%, a sharper decline than during the Global Financial Crisis. This response was reasonable given the uncertain environment. Since then, equity markets have rebounded strongly, with earnings surging, particularly from Big Tech and, more recently, AI. Dividends, typically set by cautious boards, tend to lag behind earnings during these surges. As a result, payout ratios are now close to 25-year lows, meaning companies are paying out less than historical averages, as reported by J.P. Morgan. Simply returning to more typical payout levels could result in an additional 2% growth annually over the next five years. This recovery is already taking shape, as global dividend growth has outpaced earnings growth in seven of the past eight quarters. Investors and analysts both support companies that have raised their payouts. Companies that consistently raise their dividends typically manage economic downturns better because they have strong business models, solid balance sheets, and promising earnings potential. These qualities make them attractive to investors, and historical data shows that the market tends to reward them. Stocks of companies that increase dividends often outperform the broader market while experiencing lower volatility. According to a report by AGF Investments, the companies in the broader market that grew their dividend between January 1990 and August 2024 grew by 12.1%, compared with an 11% return of companies that pay no dividends and a 10.8% return of dividend cutters. With market conditions improving, it's not surprising that an increasing number of companies are beginning to pay dividends. Our Methodology: To compile this article, we first scanned a list of stocks known for their consistent dividend track records and sustained shareholder payouts over an extended period. This group reflects stability and long-term performance in dividend payouts. From this list, we picked 10 companies with the highest number of hedge fund investors, according to Insider Monkey's database of Q3 2024.

Title: Nvidia Stock Drops Wednesday as AI Chipmaker's Roller-Coaster Week Continues
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/nvidia-stock-drops-wednesday-as-ai-chipmaker-roller-coaster-week-continues-8782483

Nvidia (NVDA) shares tumbled nearly 6% in intraday trading Wednesday, dashing hopes for a quick recovery from losses earlier in the week amid concerns about competitiveness of American AI firms and their spending on the emerging technology. The AI chipmaker's stock led losses in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and was among the top decliners on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Wednesday. Shares of Broadcom (AVGO), Palantir (PLTR), and several other AI darlings over the past year also were lower. The surging popularity of an app from Chinese startup DeepSeek, which runs on an AI model it claimed can perform on par with American rivals at a fraction of the cost, had sent Nvidia and a slew of other U.S. tech stocks into a tailspin Monday. Despite a brief rebound in Tuesday's session, the tech sector fell back into the red Wednesday as Chinese tech giant Alibaba (BABA) rolled out a new AI model it says can outperform models from DeepSeek, OpenAI, and Meta Platforms (META). The rapid rise of lower-cost models from Chinese companies that can compete with those from leading American firms has spurred a reckoning on Wall Street, with earnings from Meta and Microsoft (MSFT) likely to be in the spotlight later tonight as both firms face pressure to prove their AI investments can yield results that justify the costs. Analysts have so far remained mostly bullish on their prospects, with Morgan Stanley analysts telling clients that advances by DeekSeek could prove "positive" for Microsoft and Meta, suggesting Meta could implement them and that Microsoft's Azure platform would benefit from a proliferation of AI models and consumer applications. Bank of America analysts told clients in a note Wednesday they see this as "AI's Sputnik moment," suggesting competition could push U.S. hyperscalers like Microsoft, Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet (GOOGL) to spend even more on AI, to the benefit of Nvidia, Broadcom, and other AI chipmakers. They reiterated a "buy" rating and $190 price target for Nvidia's stock, adding they "view the recent selloff as an enhanced buy opportunity."
