Title: Micron Stock Slips From Record High Amid China Business Concerns—Watch These Key Price Levels

Micron Technology (MU) shares lost ground Friday following a report that the company will suspend some of its business in China. Reuters reported Friday that Micron will no longer supply server chips for data centers in China, after the business struggled following a ban imposed by Chinese authorities on use of the company's products in critical infrastructure. Micron will continue to sell chips to automotive and mobile phone sector customers in China, the report said. Micron shares were down 2% at around $198 in recent trading, after gaining more than 5% yesterday as Wall Street analysts offered bullish commentary on the stock. Analysts at UBS raised their price target on the stock to $245, noting that Micron should benefit from "intensifying" memory and storage hardware shortages. Citi lifted its target to $240 and said the company sits well positioned to team up with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which has recently stuck deals with Nvidia (NVDA), Advance Micro Devices (AMD), and Broadcom (AVGO). Through midday Friday, Micron shares had gained 135% since the start of the year and were up 19% in October, as investors bet that surging AI date-center demand will fuel a memory chip boom. Below, we break down the technicals on Micron’s chart and point out key price levels that investors will likely be watching. After climbing above $200 for the first time earlier this month, Micron shares consolidated in a pennant before breaking out from the pattern on Thursday. Importantly, the move occurred on the highest trading volume in more than three weeks, potentially laying the groundwork for a continuation move higher. While the relative strength index sits near its overbought threshold, the indicator still remains significantly below its June and September peaks that preceded consolidation periods, indicating the stock has ample room for the recent uptrend to continue. Let’s use technical analysis to forecast where Micron’s price may be headed next and also point out key support levels worth watching during pullbacks in the stock. Investors can forecast where Micron shares may be headed by using bars pattern analysis, a technique that analyzes prior trends to project future directional movements. When applying the analysis to the chipmaker's chart, we take the stock’s strong move higher that immediately preceded the pennant and reposition it from Thursday’s breakout point near the pattern’s top trendline. This indicates the share price could rapidly climb to around $245 if a continuation move plays out. During pullbacks, investors should initially watch the $158 level. This area could offer support near the prominent June 2024 swing high and a minor dip on the chart in September this year after an impulsive move higher. Finally, a more-significant drop could see Micron shares revisit lower support near the key $130 level. Investors may look to set buy limit orders in this location near the top of a prior symmetrical triangle, which closely aligns with major peaks on the chart in April 2024 and June this year.

Title: AVGO: Why Broadcom Stock Jumped 110%?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/17/avgo-why-broadcom-stock-jumped-110/

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Broadcom (AVGO)’s stock didn’t merely rise - it soared over 100%, driven by more than just impressive figures. A nearly 10% increase in revenue and a remarkable 71% rise in net margin suggested enhanced efficiency, but the true excitement lay just beneath the surface. Investors are rallying around the company’s ambitious advancements in artificial intelligence, selling application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) — custom chips that big tech companies use to run AI workloads efficiently, besides supplying high-speed networking solutions. Buoyed by stronger-than-expected Q2 results and a wave of upward analyst revisions, Broadcom’s latest surge reflects not just growth, but a strategic evolution — making its stock’s rise a story worth watching. So what is going on here? The stock price surged an impressive 108%, fueled by a mix of significant factors. Revenue saw a modest increase of 9.9%, and the net margin experienced a notable rise of 71%, indicating enhanced profitability. In the meantime, the valuation, reflected by the P/E multiple, grew by 11%, pointing to increasing investor confidence. Collectively, these elements illustrate the reasons behind the price movement - creating the opportunity to examine the specific events, announcements, and strategic actions that contributed to this strong performance. Before delving into the events that contributed to the stock increase, here’s what market wisdom suggests: investing in a single stock can be risky, but there is significant value in a more diversified approach, exemplified by the Trefis High Quality Portfolio. Should you purchase one stock you prefer or develop a portfolio designed to thrive across market cycles? Our data reveal that the High Quality Portfolio has turned the uncertainty of stock selection into consistent market-beating performance. This portfolio is incorporated into the asset allocation strategy of Empirical Asset Management – a Boston-based wealth manager and Trefis partner – whose asset allocation framework generated positive returns during the 2008-09 period when the S&P experienced losses of more than 40%. Separately, see – S&P 500 Poised For A 40% Crash? Here Is Why Broadcom Stock Moved Our Current Assessment Of AVGO Stock Opinion: We currently consider AVGO stock appealing yet volatile. Why? Explore the full narrative. Read Buy or Sell AVGO Stock to understand what shapes our current viewpoint. Risk: Nevertheless, AVGO is not exempt from significant declines. It dropped nearly 48% during the Covid pandemic, around 35% during the inflation shock in 2021, and about 27% during the 2018 market correction. Even with strong fundamentals, it's evident that the stock can experience a sharp decline when the market shifts. Good companies still feel the impact when sentiment changes drastically. Consistently picking winners is a challenging endeavor – particularly given the volatility associated with individual stocks. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, consisting of 30 stocks, has shown a history of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the past 4-year period. What accounts for this? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have provided superior returns with less risk compared to the benchmark index; a smoother investment journey, as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
