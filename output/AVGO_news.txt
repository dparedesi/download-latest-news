Title: How AMD, Nvidia, Broadcom Can Ride Oracle’s $455B Cloud Surge

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. On Monday, during its earnings announcement, Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) delivered a striking revelation that surprised even the most optimistic analysts. The company’s remaining performance obligations (RPO) for its cloud division surged 359% year-over-year, reaching $455 billion, compared to only $138 billion in the previous quarter. This astonishing increase caused Oracle’s stock to rise nearly 36% in Wednesday’s trading, marking its largest single-day gain in many years. Consider RPO as Oracle’s guaranteed revenue stream—contracts that have already been finalized and are just pending execution. This is not speculative thinking or hopeful forecasts; it represents money that customers have already committed. CEO Safra Catz stated that Oracle anticipates securing several additional multi-billion-dollar customers soon, pushing its RPO beyond the half-trillion-dollar threshold within months. Here’s a brief overview of how the major AI silicon players will reap benefits from Oracle’s significant initiative. How Oracle Stock Surges 3x To $900? For Oracle, turning these obligations into revenue hinges on the speed at which it can expand its infrastructure. This necessitates electricity, regulatory approvals, and high-performance GPUs, all of which are still in persistent global shortage. The corporation also increased its capital expenditure projection to $35 billion for fiscal 2026—a 65% rise that highlights the urgency of its AI infrastructure expansion. It’s no surprise that this exceptional guidance caused shares of Nvidia, Broadcom, and AMD to climb between 2% and 10%, as these chip manufacturers form the foundation of nearly every AI implementation. Each additional Oracle contract should correspond to increased demand for their semiconductors. Furthermore, in contrast to cloud competitors like Google, AWS, or Microsoft, Oracle is not developing its own bespoke AI chips. Instead, it has relied on GPUs from Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD). Oracle maintains a robust partnership with AI compute standard bearer Nvidia, which provides most of the GPUs currently utilized in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. Oracle stands out among hyperscalers by offering so-called “bare metal” instances alongside Nvidia GPUs. This affords customers direct, exclusive access to high-end physical chips like A10, A100, H100, H200, and the flagship Blackwell chips, eliminating virtualization overhead. Such a setup enables businesses to optimize performance for model training and inference. Oracle’s AI supercomputers deploy these GPUs in densely packed, liquid-cooled data centers engineered for energy efficiency and throughput. This close collaboration allows Oracle to cater to some of the most sophisticated AI applications globally at scale. Nvidia GPUs have been the backbone of Oracle’s AI infrastructure, and this partnership may prove vital as Oracle carries out its extensive AI contracts in the upcoming years. Nvidia Stock To Fall 50% As AI Cycle Turns? Oracle has also been diversifying away from solely relying on Nvidia. In June, Oracle and AMD revealed that the AMD Instinct MI355X GPUs would be available on OCI, providing more than double the price-performance of the previous generation. Oracle plans to deploy as many as 131,072 MI355X GPUs, empowering enterprises to build, train, and perform inference on massive AI models with competitive economics. This collaboration guarantees that AMD will secure a significant portion of Oracle’s AI expenditures. The MI355X, based on AMD’s new CDNA 4 architecture and TSMC’s 3nm process, marks AMD’s most significant advancement yet in AI accelerators. For Oracle, this strategy broadens its hardware alternatives, diminishes reliance on a single supplier, and is expected to enhance negotiation leverage with Nvidia for GPUs, thereby controlling overall spending. Oracle’s revenue outlook is increasingly linked to AI inference, which involves executing trained models at scale for real-time user queries. Buy or Sell AVGO Stock at $360? As AI transitions from development to widespread use, inference workloads are likely to significantly exceed training requirements, resulting in a recurring, utility-like demand stream. This is precisely where Broadcom and its custom application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) could emerge as substantial beneficiaries. While GPUs are predominant in training, inference at scale is expected to increasingly favor custom chips that provide better cost and energy efficiency. While Oracle still primarily utilizes GPUs for AI tasks, it appears that ASICs will undoubtedly play a more substantial role moving forward. This trend helps clarify why Broadcom’s stock surged nearly 10% on Wednesday—surpassing the gains of Nvidia and AMD, which increased by 2% to 4%—as investors speculate that Broadcom’s custom chips will capture part of Oracle’s workload. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, comprising 30 stocks, has a demonstrated track record of consistently outperforming its benchmark, including the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap. What drives this? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have produced superior returns with lower risk compared to the benchmark index, delivering a smoother experience, as reflected in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Watch These Broadcom Price Levels After Stock's Recent Rally on AI Optimism

Broadcom (AVGO) shares rallied to an all-time high this week as the chipmaker positions itself as a key competitor to AI favorite Nvidia (NVDA). The stock surged nearly 10% to a record close near $370 Wednesday, before pulling back slightly in Thursday's session. They've added more than half their value since the start of the year, with a close to 20% gain over the past five days alone, boosted by the company’s strong quarterly results, a new $10 billion customer, and the resurgence of the AI trade after Oracle (ORCL) reported a massive increase in its backlog. In a note to clients on Monday, Melius Research analysts said they expect Broadcom could gain about 30% of the AI compute market, while Nvidia’s market share falls over time. Below, we break down the technicals on Broadcom’s weekly chart and identify key price levels to watch after the stock’s recent bullish run. After retracing just below the 50-week moving average in March, Broadcom shares have staged an impressive reversal, with gains accelerating recently after the chipmaker’s quarterly results. While above-average trading volume has signaled buying conviction, the relative strength index warns of overbought conditions, with the indicator reaching a level that preceded major consolidation phases in the stock during late 2021 and mid-2023. Let’s use technical analysis to forecast how a long-term uptrend for Broadcom could play out, and also identify support levels worth watching during potential retracements. Investors can use bars pattern analysis to project a potential bullish price target and speculate how high the stock could go from here. When applying the technique to Broadcom’s chart, we take the stock’s uptrend from May 2023 to June 2024 and overlay it from the start of last week’s bullish move. This indicates a period of consolidation for several months before a possible rally toward $680 by October next year, if price action rhymes with the prior trend. The earlier trend began with two weekly price bars that delivered a combined gain of 27%, compared to the over 20% cumulative advance of the two most recent weekly bars. During potential pullbacks in the stock, it’s initially worth tracking the $250 level. This area on the chart may provide support near the stock’s December and January twin peaks. Selling below this level could see the Broadcom shares revisit lower support around $185. Investors may seek entry points in this location near the upper range of a consolidation period that formed on the chart between June and November last year.

Title: The AI Trade Picks Up Steam After Oracle's 'Truly Historic' Quarter
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/ai-stocks-soar-on-oracle-truly-historic-quarter-11807386
Time Published: 2025-09-10T19:56:32Z

The artificial intelligence trade got a shot of adrenaline on Wednesday after results from database software and cloud provider Oracle suggested the AI spending bonanza has ample room to run. Oracle (ORCL) on Tuesday reported its backlog swelled to $455 billion, a 359% year-over-year increase, after it signed four multibillion-dollar cloud deals in the first quarter of its 2026 fiscal year. Executives said the backlog is expected to surpass half a trillion as Oracle inks more big deals in the coming months. Oracle also forecast cloud revenue would grow from an estimated $18 billion this fiscal year to $144 billion in 2030, about $50 billion more than Wall Street had forecast. Oracle said most of that revenue forecast was already reflected in its backlog, giving some investors greater confidence in the numbers. Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that Oracle had signed a five-year contract worth $300 billion with ChatGPT creator OpenAI. Oracle’s projections completely overshadowed lackluster first-quarter results, and sent its shares soaring as much as 43% on Wednesday. The rising tide of robust AI spending was lifting plenty of boats on Wednesday. Shares of AI chip giants Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO) were recently up more than 4% and 9%, respectively, while chip design company Arm Holdings (ARM) surged more than 8%. The PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX) was up about 2%. Data center infrastructure provider Vertiv Holdings (VRT) jumped about 9%, while power generators Vistra (VST) and Constellation Energy (CEG) advanced 8% and 6%, respectively. Oracle’s major cloud competitors were the only drag on the AI trade on Wednesday. Amazon (AMZN) declined more than 3%, while Meta Platforms (META) dropped nearly 2%. Alphabet (GOOG) and Microsoft (MSFT) ticked higher. Wall Street’s ebullience over the results was first visible on Oracle’s earnings call Tuesday night. “Even I’m sort of blown away by what this looks like going forward,” said Guggenheim analyst John DiFucci at the top of the question and answer portion of the call. “I tell my team, ‘Pay attention to this’—even those that are not working on Oracle—‘because this is a career event happening right now,” DiFucci added. “There's no better evidence of a seismic shift happening in computing than these results that you just put up,” said Deutsche Bank analyst Brad Zelnick. Others called the quarter “momentous” and the backlog growth “truly historic.” AI investments have been driven by what many have characterized as insatiable demand for training and inference, and Oracle’s results appeared to support that assessment. On Oracle’s earnings call, co-founder and chair Larry Ellison said an unnamed company had requested all of Oracle’s available inferencing capacity. “I’d never gotten a call like that,” Ellison said. Big Tech’s investment in capacity to meet that demand is expected to remain robust in the coming years, supported by healthy cash flows at the biggest cloud providers and supportive tax incentives. Cloud providers like Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon have been key drivers of the AI infrastructure trade in recent years. Hyperscalers are expected to spend a cumulative $368 billion on infrastructure this year, with much of that earmarked for data centers and the chips and servers that fill them, according to Goldman Sachs. Oracle on Tuesday forecast capital expenditures of $35 billion in the 12 months through May 2026, about $10 billion more than the figure executives gave as a minimum last quarter. Tax incentives written into the recently passed One Big Beautiful Bill Act should also support AI infrastructure investment. Morgan Stanley expects the bill’s immediate capital investment depreciation provisions to boost Big Tech’s free cash flows by nearly $50 billion this year. The firm expects a sizable portion of those tax savings to be spent on AI infrastructure.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Broadcom’s stock surged 13% over the past week, following strong earnings, optimistic guidance, and a significant new order for $10 billion in custom AI chips. The key question for investors now is whether the stock is a buy at its current price of $360. We believe there is not much to fear in AVGO stock, given its overall very strong operating performance and financial condition. Therefore, despite its very high valuation, the stock appears attractive. Here is our multi-factor assessment. Separately, also look at our take on potential 2x upside for AVGO stock. Still, no matter how attractive, investing in a single stock carries high risk. Trefis High Quality Portfolio is designed to reduce stock-specific risk while giving upside exposure. Let's get into details of each of the assessed factors, but before that, a quick background: With $1.6 Tril in market cap, Broadcom provides semiconductor devices and software solutions, including set-top box system-on-chips, cable, DSL, and passive optical networking products across semiconductor and infrastructure software segments. This table highlights how AVGO is valued vs the broader market. For more details, see: AVGO Valuation Ratios This table highlights how AVGO is growing vs the broader market. For more details see: AVGO Revenue Comparison This table highlights how AVGO’s profitability compares with the broader market. For more details, see: AVGO Operating Income Comparison AVGO saw an impact slightly better than the S&P 500 index during various economic downturns. We assess this based on both (a) how much the stock fell and (b) how quickly it recovered. But the risk is not limited to major market crashes. Stocks fall even when markets are good—think events like earnings, business updates, or outlook changes. Read AVGO Dip Buyer Analyses to see how the stock has recovered from sharp dips in the past. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming its benchmark that includes all 3 - S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index—less of a roller-coaster ride—as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
