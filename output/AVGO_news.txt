Title: Watch These IonQ Price Levels After Quantum Stock Soared 37% on Thursday

IonQ (IONQ) shares surged Thursday to lead quantum computing stocks higher as the company’s CEO said it aims to become the Nvidia (NVDA) of quantum computing. CEO Niccolo de Masi told Barron’s in an interview that the company is “in the business of quantum just like Nvidia and Broadcom (AVGO) are in the business of classical GPUs,” asserting that he believes IonQ will be the Nvidia player. The remarks come after D-Wave Quantum (QBTS) earlier this week announced the launch of its next gen quantum computer, known as Advantage2, underpinning bullish sentiment across Wall Street’s latest hottest sector. IonQ shares jumped 37% to $45.79 on Thursday, pushing the stock into positive territory for 2025. The shares have more than doubled from their early-April lows and have risen more than five fold over the last year, as investors bet that quantum computing will revolutionize areas like drug discovery, cybersecurity, and finance. Below, we take a closer look at IonQ’s chart and apply technical analysis to identify price levels that investors will likely be watching. After finding support at the closely watched 200-day moving average, IonQ shares trended higher within a rising wedge before staging a volume-backed breakout above the pattern in Thursday’s trading session. While the relative strength index confirms bullish price momentum with a reading above the 70 threshold, the indicator also flashes overbought conditions that could trigger short-term profit-taking. Let’s identify two key overhead areas on IonQ’s chart to watch amid the stock’s recent buying and also locate support levels worth monitoring during potential retracements. The first overhead area to watch sits around $55. Investors who have accumulated shares during the rising wedge could look for exit points at this level near the stock’s all-time high. To forecast an upside price target above the all-time high, investors can use the bars pattern tool. When applying the technique to IonQ’s chart, we extract the price bars comprising the stock’s uptrend from November to January and reposition them from today’s breakout point. This analysis projects a target of around $100, about 120% above Thursday’s closing price. We selected this prior move higher as it commenced following a one-day gain of around 35%, similar to Thursday’s percentage change. It's also worth noting that trend played out over 40 trading days, meaning a similar move from the current breakout could last until late July if price action rhymes. During retracements in the stock, investors should initially monitor the $28 level. This area on the chart finds support from the nearby rising 50-day MA and a horizontal line that connects a range of trading activity on the chart extending back to last November. Finally, selling below this level could see IonQ shares revisit lower support around $18. Investors may seek buying opportunities in this location near the late-October peak and early-March trough.
