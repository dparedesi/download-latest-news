Title: ASML Stock: An Overlooked AI Play?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. ASML (NASDAQ:ASML), the Dutch semiconductor equipment powerhouse recognized as one of the most crucial firms in the semiconductor ecosystem, has witnessed its stock rise almost 25% in the last month, bouncing back from a decline in July following its Q2 earnings report, which sparked worries about demand for 2026. ASML’s significance lies in its distinctive function: it manufactures the machines that enable the production of the world's most advanced chips, making it essential to the entire semiconductor value chain. With the stock gaining momentum, is now the right time to invest? To provide context, here’s what ASML specializes in. ASML produces the most advanced manufacturing tools in the semiconductor sector, and arguably, the entire world. Its standout product is its extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines. These devices utilize ultra-short light wavelengths to engrave fine circuit patterns on silicon wafers, facilitating the manufacture of the leading-edge chips of 5 nanometers and below. Put simply, without ASML, the processors that power AI data centers, smartphones, and even contemporary vehicles would not be possible. Thus, ASML stands out as a unique enterprise. EUV technology plays a vital role in prolonging Moore’s Law, a long-held industry trend whereby transistor density doubles roughly every two years, enabling chipmakers to keep pushing the boundaries of computing capabilities and cost efficiency. See AVGO Stock vs. NVDA & INTC Multiple factors have shifted sentiment to be more favorable for ASML recently. To start, U.S. tariffs on semiconductor equipment, which include ASML’s lithography machines, were avoided thanks to a U.S.-EU trade agreement that exempts semiconductor production equipment from tariffs. This alleviated a significant worry for ASML's stock. Regarding demand, investment in AI remains robust. Major players like Nvidia and Broadcom are experiencing substantial growth as the increase in training and executing intricate models drives demand for high-performance semiconductors—the very kind ASML’s machines enable to manufacture. Indeed, the company reports that many of its largest customers are already increasing their EUV capacity to match the escalating need for AI chips. To illustrate the scale of these investments, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta (NASDAQ:META) indicated a potential cumulative capital expenditure of $364 billion for their respective current fiscal years. Much of this could translate into heightened demand for ASML. Importantly, ASML’s largest client, TSMC, reported a 37% year-over-year increase in revenue through August 2025. This impressive revenue growth is attributed to advanced nodes such as 3nm and 5nm, with the scaling up of 2nm chips expected to further stimulate demand for ASML’s EUV machinery. ASML stock is currently trading at 36x projected FY2025 earnings, which is slightly high, but there are positive signs for the stock. According to consensus estimates, ASML’s revenues are set to increase by a robust 14% this year. During the past quarter, ASML recorded net bookings of 5.5 billion euros ($6.4 billion), approximately 25% above expectations, and a historic backlog of 33 billion euros ($38 billion). With lead times of 12 to 18 months for most of its offerings, current orders should accurately reflect customer confidence well into 2026, suggesting favorable prospects for future revenue growth. Additionally, the company’s dominant market position, cutting-edge and proprietary technology, and its connection to the generative AI trend could also render the stock appealing.
