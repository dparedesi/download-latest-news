Nvidia stock (NVDA) jumped as much as 2.7% early Thursday as Wall Street analysts reiterated their Buy ratings on the stock despite concerns about rising competition and the possibility that artificial intelligence chip demand could wane. Over the past few days, Wall Street analysts at Bernstein, TD Cowen, Morgan Stanley, and Truist have maintained bullish outlooks on the company. “All relevant industry contacts support the dominance and superiority of NVDA's full technology stack,” Truist Securities’ William Stein wrote on Monday. He raised his price target on the stock to $204 from $169. Following the nods from Wall Street, Nvidia shares rallied as much as 4.8% Wednesday. But the stock later reversed direction, ending the day down roughly 1%, as stocks fell across the board following commentary from the Federal Reserve projecting fewer rate cuts and stickier inflation in 2025. Even with Thursday's early morning gain, Nvidia stock is still off roughly 11% from its record close of $148.88 in early November. Nvidia shares have fallen as investors worry its GPUs could lose share in the broader AI chip market given that its customers are developing their own custom chips. Google (GOOG) and Meta (META) have developed chips with Broadcom (AVGO). Microsoft (MSFT), Tesla (TSLA), and Amazon (AMZN) also make their own custom chips. Broadcom’s announcement that it’s developing chips for two more clients, who are believed to be ChatGPT-maker OpenAI and Apple (AAPL), boosted the chipmaker’s stock last week and sent Nvidia’s in the opposite direction. These custom chips, called ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits), could potentially threaten Nvidia’s GPUs, given that they are cheaper and tailored to a tech company’s specific AI needs. A Morgan Stanley report released on Dec. 15 showed that custom chips used to run cloud AI services could grow their share of the overall AI chip market from 11% in 2024 to 15% in 2030. Still, Morgan Stanley said, “history is certainly on Nvidia's side” when it comes to maintaining dominance of the AI chip market. “We think ASICs have continued to improve, but Nvidia's strong execution continues to raise the bar for its competitors." It's a point on Nvidia that Bank of America semiconductor analyst Vivek Arya reiterated Wednesday in an episode of the Opening Bid podcast (video above). Additionally, concerns loom that the Big Tech spending on AI chips that fueled Nvidia's rise could slow down. Commentary from Microsoft and Google in their most recent earnings reports indicated that their AI spending will grow at a slower pace in the future. And there are concerns that AI models are no longer improving at their previous breakneck pace, which could also put a damper on investment. TD Cowen analyst Joshua Buchalter said the firm's recent meeting with Nvidia showed the chipmaker is aware of that concern but "remains confident in the industry's ability to progress and continue to innovate." Stein also believes Nvidia will announce a standalone CPU, or central processing unit — the “brain” of a computer, distinct from Nvidia’s Hopper and Blackwell GPUs, or graphics processing units — in 2025, opening up what he sees as a $35 billion market opportunity. Nvidia currently uses its Arm-based Grace CPUs alongside its Blackwell GPUs in servers it sells to customers but does not sell CPUs individually. Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia Corporation (NVDA, Financials) in the year thus far is up approximately 182% on last look, positioning it at the forefront of U.S.-listed semiconductor companies. Its developments in artificial intelligence technologiesincluding the H100 Tensor Core GPUs necessary for training big language models like ChatGPT and the RTX 40 Series GPUs targeted at gamers and creative professionalshelp to explain this spike. Strategic alliances with big cloud companies such Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure have strengthened Nvidia's market share even further. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with NVDA. With profits of $18.1 billion in the third quarter of 2024, Nvidia recorded a 206% annual year-over-year (YoY) net income of $9.2 billion, up 472% YoY. Especially, data center goods generated more than 70% of this income, which emphasizes the company's emphasis on artificial intelligence-driven applications. With a YTD increase of around 114%, Broadcom Inc. (AVGO, Financials) has also seen notable expansion. Tomahawk 5 Ethernet devices and the company's own application-specific integrated circuits have driven data center workloads in considerable part. In the fourth quarter of 2024 Broadcom disclosed revenue of $9.8 billion, a 15% YoY increase, and net income of $3.7 billion; the company forecasts $3 billion in revenue from AI-related products for the fiscal year 2024. About 92.5% YTD increase has been recorded by Marvell Technology (MRVL, Financials). In artificial intelligence storage and cloud computing, the company's Bravera SC5 SSD controllers and Octeon 10 DPU series have become very popular. Marvell said net income of $220 million, an 11% YoY rise, and profits of $1.53 billion in the third quarter of 2024. By 2025, the business forecasts that items connected to artificial intelligence will make thirty percent of its income. With a YTD increase of around 33%, Micron Technology (MU, Financials) is on a high as well. Along with new DDR5 DRAM products in great demand for cloud and business industries, the firm unveiled HBM3 memory chips specifically for high-bandwidth artificial intelligence and high-performance computer uses. Attributed to inventory write-downs, Micron achieved income of $6.1 billion even though the fourth quarter of 2024 had a net loss of $895 million. Adoption of artificial intelligence is expected by the corporation to balance demand for its goods and price. This article first appeared on GuruFocus. Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: 6 Best ETFs To Buy And Invest In 2025

getty Megacap stocks dominated in 2024, creating nice returns for anyone invested in the Nasdaq-100 and S&P 500. Unfortunately, no financial market trend lasts forever. Many pundits believe the megacap growth could pause in 2025, leaving room for other stock market segments to take the lead. If you agree with that prediction, you may need to reset your exchange-traded fund portfolio for the year ahead. Let's explore three critical ETF selection criteria and meet six ETFs that may be winners in 2025. You have many ETF options available, and choosing the right one can be overwhelming. To keep your search efficient, focus on low-expense funds that deliver the appropriate risk and market exposure. ETFs have administrative expenses that they pass on to shareholders. The funds disclose these expenses as an expense ratio. The ratio is a percentage representing shareholders' annual expense burden. In 2016, Morningstar published a white paper stating that the "expense ratio is the most proven predictor of future fund returns." The paper included the recommendation that investors evaluate expense ratios early in their selection process. That recommendation still stands today. Only one of the ETFs introduced below has an expense ratio above 0.04%. A 0.04% expense ratio equates to $4 in expenses annually for every $10,000 invested. Managing risk according to what you can handle is a primary investing responsibility. Too much or too little risk undermines your commitment to the strategy. Whether your portfolio is too volatile or too conservative, the common reaction is the same: You'll want to change things. Emotional decision-making can result and returns can suffer. So, think about the risk level you want, with the understanding that risk and reward go together. High risk means greater earnings potential but with volatility. Low risk means less volatility and lower gain potential. Market exposure refers to the types of assets the fund holds. For example, a fund that replicates the S&P 500, which includes 500 of the largest public companies, has large-cap exposure. A fund that holds Nasdaq-100 stocks has large-cap technology exposure. Your targeted exposure should align with your risk tolerance.

Let's explore each of these funds in more detail below. Schwab's small-cap ETF tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Small-Cap Total Stock Market Index. The fund provides easy, diversified access to the small-cap segment of the U.S. stock market. In 2025, smaller companies stand to benefit from falling interest rates and, possibly, deregulation and lower corporate tax rates courtesy of a new presidential administration. These conditions encourage growth and expansion, which are primary goals for small companies. Larger companies may not see the same boost. Big corporations often have higher concentrations of fixed-rate debt, which doesn't reprice to lower market rates until refinanced. As well, large-caps with international revenue sources will see a lesser impact from tax cuts. As well, large-caps are plagued by high valuations right now, which contributes to volatility. The current price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of the S&P 500 is 31. The SCHA portfolio compares favorably on this metric, with a PE ratio of 18. SSGA's mid-cap fund tracks the S&P 400 Mid Cap Index. Holdings include Williams Sonoma (WSM), DocuSign (DOCU) and Burlington Stores (BURL). Mid-sized companies should see the same tailwinds as small caps in 2025—but with the potential for better results. Mid-caps are more established, mature and profitable than small caps. They also have better access to capital, which makes them more resilient. Resilience could play a role if the economic and policy tailwinds don't materialize as expected. If the Fed takes its time lowering interest rates, for example, mid-caps could outperform small-caps and large-caps next year. SPMD's PE ratio is 18.7, slightly higher than the Schwab small-cap fund. iShares Core S&P Total U.S. Stock Market ETF tracks the S&P Total Market Index. The index intends to represent all segments of the stock market, from microcaps to megacaps. If you don't want to bet on one market segment, this fund covers all bases. The portfolio includes companies of all sizes and from all economic sectors. For better or worse, ITOT will deliver market-level returns, minus a few basis points for fund expenses. Note that the ITOT portfolio is weighted by market capitalization, so the biggest companies are held in the largest proportions. Concentration risk is a concern—the “Magnificent 7” megacap stocks will have undue influence over the entire group's performance.

The index and the fund are sector-diversified with larger holdings in financials, industrials and healthcare. As we close out 2024, growth stock valuations are running high. This trend could continue, stretching stock prices even higher relative to earnings. Or, it could reverse in a pullback. Either way, the conditions look good for value stocks to shine as a counterpoint. Investors may add value stock exposure to offset the rising risk of high valuations in growth, or in response to a reset. VTV is an easy option to secure that exposure. The fund holds premier value stock names, including Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) and Procter & Gamble (PG), plus the AI stock Broadcom (AVGO). Invesco's high dividend low volatility fund tracks an index that includes 50 dividend-paying S&P 500 stocks. The holdings are primarily large-caps with value characteristics. SPHD is popular among income investors. To learn more, see how to build an ETF portfolio for income and best ETFs for income investing. While investors are cautiously optimistic about the U.S. economy and the Republican agenda, there is an undercurrent of uncertainty. Certain policy changes, such as new tariffs, could invite inflation. Lingering inflation, in turn, would slow the pace of the Fed's interest rate cuts. When investor uncertainty is combined with high valuations and over-concentration in the S&P 500, volatility can result. The high income and low volatility characteristics of SPHD's portfolio could provide some shelter if the market turns into a rollercoaster in 2025. Vanguard's VGLT fund holds Treasury bonds with maturities ranging from 10 to 25 years. As of December 2024, the average coupon rate is 3.2% and the yield to maturity is 4.5%. Long-term bonds are reactive to market interest rate changes because they don't reprice as quickly as short-term bonds. The pricing response goes in the opposite direction of interest rates. Given the prevailing opinion that rates will decline in 2025, today's long-term bonds may carry above-market rates sometime next year. That will drive their value on the secondary market higher. VGLT provides that long-term bond exposure. The fund is a suitable diversification option within or outside a Vanguard retirement investing portfolio. As an ETF investor, there are times when you want protection from certain elements of the market. Factors to watch currently include high valuations and the excessive influence of megacaps. Diversifying your ETF portfolio with small cap, midcap and value stock exposure may provide the protection you need in the year ahead. Total U.S. stock market ETFs with low expense ratios are suitable for beginners in 2025. These provide exposure to all U.S. economic sectors, small to large companies and a blend of growth and value characteristics. To choose an ETF, first decide what type of assets you need—as in stocks, bonds or a combination. Then, review funds that align with your needs and select one with a low expense ratio, low tracking error, long history of performance and good trading volume. ETFs are not necessarily better than stocks. ETFs can be more appropriate for novice investors than individual stocks because ETFs are diversified. The most tax-efficient ETFs are those that pay no dividends or interest. Many ETFs will make capital gains distributions annually, which are taxable. You can defer the tax liability of ETF income and gains by holding the funds in a tax-advantaged account. Yes, you can lose money with ETFs. You can mitigate the risk of loss somewhat by choosing diversified funds and holding them for years or decades, rather than months.

Nvidia (NVDA+2.50%) stock climbed during Wednesday morning trading after slumping into correction territory earlier in the week. The chipmaker’s shares were up by about 3.5% before noon Wednesday after falling into a correction at market close Monday. Nvidia’s shares continued falling by almost 3% Tuesday. The company’s shares are up by 180% so far this year. Meanwhile, rival chip designer Broadcom (AVGO+4.18%) closed up more than 11% Monday after it soared 20% Friday to surpass the $1 trillion market cap for the first time. The chipmaker reported a 220% jump in artificial intelligence revenue for the fourth quarter ended in November. On the company’s earnings call, Broadcom chief executive Hock Tan said it sees “our opportunity over the next three years in AI as massive.” Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote that Broadcom was having an “Nvidia moment” in a Monday note, reported by MarketWatch. Rasgon noted “a likely sharp new product ramp into [the second half of] 2025, and outlook for material opportunity … a few years out.” However, Broadcom’s stock fell by more than 5% Tuesday, and its shares were down by more than 3% during Wednesday morning trading. The chipmaker’s shares are up by almost 103% so far this year. Meanwhile, Microsoft (MSFT+1.01%) reportedly bought twice as many of Nvidia’s Hopper chips as its rivals this year. The tech giant is estimated to have bought 485,000 of the chips — more than double Nvidia’s second-largest U.S. customer, Meta (META+0.92%), which bought 224,000, the Financial Times reported, citing analysts at technology consultancy Omdia. The analysts estimate Amazon (AMZN+0.90%) bought 196,000 Hopper chips, and Google (GOOGL+1.58%) bought 169,000.

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. NVIDIA has reigned uncontested over the AI chip sphere for far too long. However, now it seems that some much-needed competition is finally putting up a challenge to the GPU manufacturer's full-spectrum dominance over this critical arena. OMDIA: $GOOGL'S TPU DEMAND GROWS, CHALLENGING $NVDA'S AI CHIP DOMINANCE Omdia research shows surging demand for Google's TPU chips, with estimates suggesting they could account for $6B–$9B in Broadcom's AI semiconductor revenue this year. At even $6B, TPU shipments are growing… — Wall St Engine (@wallstengine) December 18, 2024 To wit, Omdia Research has now published its fresh take on the dynamics within the AI chip sphere, noting that Goggle's Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) could account for between $6 billion and $9 billion in AI-related sales for Broadcom this year. As a refresher, Broadcom is currently developing custom AI chips (ASICs) for three major customers: Google, Meta, and ByteDance. The company is also developing next-gen AIXPUs with two other clients. For the benefit of those who might not be aware, many cloud providers have begun preferring custom chips or ASICs over NVIDIA's GPUs due to the former's cost advantage over the latter, which enables cost-effective optimization of internal workloads. As per Morgan Stanley's estimates, the custom AI chip market - driven primarily by cloud providers - will grow from $120 billion in 2024 to $300 billion by 2027, outpacing the growth rate for the GPU market. Coming back, Omdia believes that even if Broadcom's TPU shipments for 2024 ultimately clock-in at $6 billion, which constitutes the low-end of the research firm's estimated range, they would still be significant enough to dent NVIDIA's AI chip market share! Looking ahead, Omdia continues to see TPU-powered AI products driving broad-based growth for Google Cloud. $NVDA +2.75% [Microsoft bought twice as many of Nvidia’s flagship chips as any of its largest rivals in the U.S. and China this year, per FT. Analysts at Omdia, a technology consultancy, estimate that $MSFT bought 485K of Nvidia’s “Hopper” chips this year. That put Microsoft far… — NOTRELOAD AI (@thudderwicks) December 18, 2024 Of course, this does not mean that NVIDIA is about to cede its market dominance anytime soon. As an illustration, Omdia notes elsewhere that Microsoft bought a whopping 485,000 units of NVIDIA's Hopper GPUs in 2024, while Meta bought another 224,000 units of these last-gen chips. Meanwhile, NVIDIA continues to prepare the ground for its next-gen Blackwell GPUs to take volume leadership from the older Hopper chips. Citi on $NVDA (Buy; PT $175): 'Recent custom ASIC chipmakers’ $MRVL and $AVGO strong results are stirring up new investor questions on the old 'GPU vs Custom ASIC' debate. As highlighted in our recent report, we expect both to coexist with the software reprogrammability to… — Wall St Engine (@wallstengine) December 18, 2024 Meanwhile, Citi expects the AI chip sphere to grow to a TAM of $380 billion by 2028, where AI GPUs (read NVIDIA) control 75 percent of the market while ASICs account for the residual 25 percent.

Title: Nvidia's Blackwell chip could push the company into a new stratosphere as the AI revolution continues

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia stock (NVDA) is on pace for a comfortable triple-digit percentage gain again in 2024, after a nearly 240% surge in 2023. This year's rise is due in no small part to a product that wasn’t even shipped until the last quarter of the year — Blackwell. It’s the largest GPU (graphics processing unit) ever built, created by connecting two dies via a high bandwidth interface (HBI). In layperson’s terms, that translates to a lot of power at high efficiency, which is why it's been in such demand from the so-called hyperscalers — companies like Alphabet (GOOG) and Microsoft (MSFT) that are building out huge data centers to power large language models (LLMs). That hot demand for Blackwell and the 170% surge in Nvidia shares is what led Yahoo Finance to name the chip its 2024 Product of the Year. Read more: Here's why Walmart won the 2024 Yahoo Finance Company of the Year award “Technically, Blackwell is a beast,” Matt Kimball, an analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, told Yahoo Finance in an email. “Blackwell is an exponential leap forward as it is a dual GPU on a single chip with faster connectivity, a larger pool of high bandwidth memory (HBM3E), and the introduction of NVIDIA’s decompression engine to make data processing much faster (up to 6x relative to Hopper).” First announced in March, Blackwell is in the right place at the right time. Data centers that power generative AI or LLMs are currently occupied with inputting data and training those models. Blackwell and its predecessor, Hopper, are well-suited for that work. Blackwell represents an enormous advancement in power. It contains 208 billion transistors, more than two and a half times the number in Hopper. Its GB200 NVL72 server, which combines 72 Blackwell GPUs with 36 Grace CPUs, clocks up to a 30x performance increase compared to the same number of Hopper GPUs for LLM inference workloads. It also uses up to 25x less energy. “For us to leapfrog ourselves by an order of magnitude is pretty unheard of,” Dion Harris, director of accelerated data center, HPC (high-performance computing), and AI at Nvidia, said in a phone interview. “We were limited by physics, but we recognized that innovation with the HBI would allow us to extend the die-level communication and compute.” US business spending on generative AI has sextupled in a year, going from $2.3 billion in 2023 to $13.8 billion in 2024, according to Menlo Ventures. And the trend is only going up, as major companies from banking and retail to tech and hospitality race to introduce advanced chatbots and assistants to their customers. Nvidia's clients are paying dearly for their chips. The company doesn't break out Blackwell sales specifically, but KeyBanc analyst John Vinh estimates that Blackwell will account for $4 billion to $5 billion in sales in the current quarter. "After Q4, we should start to see a pretty quick ramp," he said in a phone interview. "For next year, we’re modeling $187 billion in compute data center revenues, of which 80% of that should be Blackwell." "Having such dominant market share, they have pricing power," he added. "As a hyperscaler, you pretty much have to pay Nvidia whatever they want." Nvidia’s rivals such as AMD (AMD) and even Amazon (AMZN) are working hard to develop their own alternatives. How long the GPU giant’s AI chip dominance can last has been up for debate ever since its shocking upside revenue beat in May 2023. Those questions have gotten louder as of late. Its shares have pulled back 12% from their record close on Nov. 7. And since the beginning of December, other semiconductor news has been getting buzz, including Amazon’s Trainium2 and Nova semiconductors. Broadcom (AVGO) has been gaining steam following its earnings report, catapulting its market cap to over $1 trillion. The crux of the excitement is the company's contract AI chip business, which CEO Hock Tan said would reach a "total serviceable market" of $60 billion to $90 billion by 2027. That said, "No one has been able to come out with a successful custom solution" that matches Nvidia's, Vinh said. Because Nvidia's earnings have been growing at a rapid clip alongside its share price, its valuation has remained competitive with other chipmakers. Its forward price-to-earnings ratio, for example, stands at nearly 31, compared to 25 for AMD and 46 for Broadcom, according to Yahoo Finance data. Companies like Amazon remain Nvidia customers even as they develop competing products. Nvidia dominates the market for training generative AI models — accounting for roughly 85% share — “and they’re not losing,” said Ben Bajarin, CEO of Creative Strategies. But once that training is complete, the models will turn to inference — putting all that information they’ve digested and learned to work. The power needed for inference is generally lower than that of training, though Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has consistently maintained that his company’s chips are well-suited to that stage as well. One factor in whether customers will continue to buy is cost. In addition to being the most advanced chips, Nvidia’s are also the most expensive. The company touts its TCO, or total cost of ownership, emphasizing computing power relative to energy usage over the life of the chips. “I doubt they’ll have the same market share they have today in inference,” Bajarin said. “There will be much more competition for inference.” Thus far, however, Nvidia’s biggest point of friction has been its own supply chain. A chip of Blackwell’s complexity and power has hit manufacturing and design snags, as Huang has acknowledged. After delays, the chip is expected to ship this Q4 and ramp up production next year. “Blackwell production is in full steam,” Huang said in the company's latest earnings call. “I think we're in great shape with respect to the Blackwell ramp at this point.” Still, the company said demand will exceed supply for several quarters. Nvidia's pace of overall sales growth is predicted to slow over the next year, a factor of the "law of large numbers," Jordan Klein, analyst at Mizuho Group, said in an email. Nvidia's sales rose by 126% in calendar 2023 over the prior year. They'll rise by 111% this year, according to analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, and 52% next year. "Nothing to worry about really, demand still exceeds supply," Klein said.

Broadcom recently reported its Q4 fiscal 2024 results (fiscal ends in October), with revenues of $14.05 billion and earnings of $1.42 per share, versus the consensus estimates of $14.09 billion and $1.38, respectively. Broadcom is seeing a stellar demand for its AI products, a trend expected to continue in the coming years. Let’s dive deeper into the company’s recent performance and the impact on its stock price. Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. Broadcom’s revenue of 14.05 billion in Q4 was up a stellar 51% y-o-y. This can partly be attributed to the contribution from VMware, which it acquired for $69 billion last year. Apart from VMware, Broadcom’s AI products contributed to its top-line growth. The company’s AI revenue in fiscal 2024 stood at $12.2 billion, reflecting a whopping 220% y-o-y growth, driven by strong demand for its AI XPUs (Broadcom’s custom AI accelerators) and Ethernet products. Broadcom is benefiting from the generative AI boom, with its wide suite of networking and storage solutions, cybersecurity, and semiconductor offerings. Broadcom also announced that it’s developing AI chips with three large cloud companies, which reportedly include Google and Meta. The company’s outlook of $14.6 billion in Q1 fiscal 2025 also reflects a strong 22% y-o-y growth. Not only did the company post strong revenues in Q4, its adjusted operating margin expanded 90 bps y-o-y to 62.7%. Higher revenues and margin expansion resulted in the bottom line of $1.42 on an adjusted basis, versus $1.11 in the prior-year quarter. Also, look at What's Behind The 500% Rise In RGTI Stock? Admirably, AVGO stock has generated better returns than the broader market in each of the last 4 years. Returns for the stock were 56% in 2021, -13% in 2022, 104% in 2023, and 104% so far this year. Similarly, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Broadcom’s solid growth for its AI products and guidance prompted an upward revision for its stock price by several Wall Street analysts. That said, most of the estimates are now met, after a large 40% move seen in a week. At its current levels of $250, AVGO stock now trades at 23x trailing revenues, versus the stock’s average P/S ratio of 5x over the last three years. Now, the company’s acquisition of VMware, the massive opportunity in generative AI with its chips, as well as networking products, and strong profitability does warrant a meaningful upward revision in valuation multiple. After its recent rally, AVGO has now become the eighth stock to exceed the $1 trillion market capitalization. Notably, the $226 average of analysts price estimate for AVGO stock implies that it’s now fully valued. While AVGO stock looks like it is fully valued, it is helpful to see how Broadcom’s Peers fare on metrics that matter.

Nvidia (NVDA+2.50%) stock is in correction territory, and rival chipmaker Broadcom’s (AVGO+4.18%) late-year boost took a hit Tuesday morning. Shares of Nvidia fell 2.9% Tuesday, trading at $128.17, after slumping into a correction by market close the day before. A correction typically refers to when a stock falls 10% or more from an all-time high closing price. Nvidia stock rallied to an all-time high of $148.87 in early November. Competing semiconductor manufacturer Broadcom ended its hot streak after closing up more than 11% Monday and ending the day at $250. Broadcom stock fell more than 5% in Tuesday morning trading, to $326.54 per share. So far this month, shares of Broadcom are up roughly 50%, putting the stock on track to have its best month ever and adding hundreds of billions to its market capitalization. Broadcom now has a market cap of $1.17 trillion. Nvidia stock is still up more than 170% year-to-date. Broadcom shares have climbed 130% in the same period. As Nvidia sinks and Broadcom soars, the latter chipmaker is finally having its own “Nvidia moment,” Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in a Monday note reported by MarketWatch (NWSA+1.27%). The company’s “robust AI story is finding its own ‘Nvidia moment’ with a likely sharp new product ramp into [the second half of] 2025, and outlook for material opportunity … a few years out,” Rasgon said. Despite a “fairly lousy” core business outside of artificial intelligence, Broadcom posted promising fourth-quarter earnings last week that beat Wall Street estimates and provided upbeat guidance for the year to come. This past fiscal year, Broadcom generated a record $30.1 billion in semiconductor revenue, driven by AI revenue of $12.2 billion, the company said. AI revenue alone grew 220% on an annual basis, fueled by the company’s AI XPUs and Ethernet networking portfolio. Broadcom is expecting first quarter revenue of approximately $14.6 billion, with EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) of 66% of projected revenue over the three months. In a call with analysts, company leadership said it sees the opportunity “over the next three years in AI as massive.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Broadcom’s ‘Nvidia moment’ has arrived. Now it needs to deliver

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- Broadcom Inc.’s massive rally after last week’s earnings report is reminiscent of when Nvidia Corp. shares first started to take off back in 2023. The chipmaker now needs to prove it can follow through to become another giant of the artificial intelligence era. Most Read from Bloomberg How California Sees the World, and Itself Hong Kong's Expat Party Hub Reshaped by Chinese Influx London’s Tube Fares Are Set to Rise by 4.6% Next Year Broadcom shares have soared 38% through Monday’s close — the two trading days since it reported results — pushing the company’s market capitalization to nearly $1.2 trillion. At the heart of the rally is Broadcom’s prediction that the addressable market for AI components it designs for data center operators will be as big as $90 billion by fiscal 2027. But there’s a lot to be done to turn that opportunity into reality. Shares fell as much as 4.7% in early trading Tuesday. “This is kind of like the Nvidia moment of maybe a year-and-a-half ago where they blew the number out and everybody had to catch up and chase it,” said Ken Mahoney, chief executive officer at Mahoney Asset Management, which owns the stock. Broadcom is showing investors that the demands from AI computing are so big that there’s plenty of room for other winners aside from Nvidia, Mahoney said. Broadcom was having a strong year even before last week’s results, with solid growth in its AI business underpinning its performance as one of the top stocks in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index. Still, it hasn’t been a completely smooth ride: The shares plunged in September after the company gave a disappointing forecast because of weakness in its non-AI operations. This quarter’s results have turned the focus squarely back to AI. Broadcom shares are now up more than 110% year-to-date, set for the best annual performance since their 2009 listing. Analysts have been scrambling to keep up, with multiple Wall Street firms hiking price targets and estimates following the earnings. Still, even a 19% jump in the average analyst target since the results has failed to keep pace with the shares, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This trajectory has inevitably spurred comparisons with Nvidia, the stock market’s original AI winner. Nvidia followed its blowout earnings report in May 2023 with a series of estimate-beating results and quarterly forecasts. It has also defied skeptics who said 2024 would be tough for the shares. Nvidia is up about 159% this year, but has pulled back in the past few days — possibly because investors are considering the prospect of rising competition from Broadcom. “I see a lot of parallels between Broadcom and Nvidia,” said Joe Tigay, portfolio manager of the Rational Equity Armor Fund, who sees reason to believe Broadcom’s stock can show sustainable gains in the same way as Nvidia. “Obviously Broadcom still needs to deliver to justify a 38 times multiple, but it has shown good growth and execution this year.” That multiple — the price investors have to pay for shares relative to earnings projected over the next 12 months — is pushing deeper into record territory. That may suggest Broadcom has limited room for error, though Nvidia has set a bullish precedent for investors wanting to jump onto the next big potential AI winner. Nvidia’s profits grew so fast last year that the valuation actually got cheaper as the stock rose, because estimates were being raised at an even faster clip. Estimates for Broadcom’s net earnings per share for fiscal 2025 have risen 12% in the past week. Still, not every “Nvidia moment” has turned into a sustained gain, with some companies failing to live up to expectations or seeing share-price rallies stall. Arm Holdings Plc gave a bullish forecast in February, and said it was “only at the beginning” of the AI boom. That sparked a 93% surge in the stock over the next three sessions, but the shares haven’t progressed much since then and are now down more than 20% from a July peak. “It is too soon to say whether we’re going to see a series of blowout reports like we’ve gotten from Nvidia,” said Alec Young, chief investment strategist at Mapsignals. “Broadcom has done a really good job, but these things don’t always end well.” Top Tech Stories TikTok and its Chinese parent company asked the US Supreme Court to block a government ban set to take effect next month, invoking favorable comments about the popular social-media platform from President-elect Donald Trump. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. has agreed to sell its Intime department store business to Youngor Fashion Co. for around $1 billion in a move to offload non-core assets. Kioxia Holdings Corp. was supposed to be an irresistible debutant in a hot Japanese market, heralding the rise of a homegrown chipmaker with big backers and a storied pedigree. It may get a cooler reception than anticipated. Beijing-based Zhipu raised a further 3 billion yuan ($412 million) to power its artificial intelligence development efforts.

Another day, another rally by mega tech stocks. Shares of iPhone maker Apple, Google-parent Alphabet, electric car maker Tesla and AI-chipmaker Broadcom all rallied to new all-time highs, which helped power the tech-heavy Nasdaq to its own record peak. The Nasdaq closed up 1.24%, or 247.17 points, at a record 20,173.89. The broad S&P 500 index ended up 0.38%, or 22.99 points, at 6,074.08 and the blue-chip Dow slipped for an eight consecutive session for its longest streak of declines since 2018. It closed down 0.25%, or 110.58 points, at 43,717.48. All eyes are on the Federal Reserve's policy meeting, which ends on Wednesday afternoon. Although the Fed's expected to trim its short-term, benchmark fed funds rate again by a quarter percentage point, many economists expect the central bank to signal a slower pace of rate cuts next year and revise its economic outlook. "This could be the last cut for a while," said Jacob Channel, senior economist at comparison site LendingTree. "Because the upcoming Trump Administration’s policies might cause a resurgence in inflation or otherwise throw the economy off balance, the Fed might choose to take a wait-and-see approach and hold rates steady at their January meeting." Capitalize on high interest rates: Best current CD rates The day's winners included: Broadcom (AVGO): The chip software company extended its rally off its better-than-expected earnings report late Thursday and strong outlook. Shares are now up more than 120% for the year. Bitcoin: The cryptocurrency surged to an all-time high above $107,000 after MicroStrategy said it bought an additional 15,350 bitcoin, bringing its total holdings to 439,000, worth about $46 billion. Companies with the largest declines included: Super Micro Computer (SMCI): The AI server company said its auditor resigned this fall and its shares will be axed from the Nasdaq-100. Nvidia (NVDA): The AI chip company's shares slipped, putting it officially into correction territory, traders said. Shares are down more than 10% from its closing high of $148.88 reached last month. Analysts said money's moving into other AI-related companies after Nvidia's 166% run up this year. Oil fell 1% to $70.58 per barrel after China reported soft retail sales data. The 10-year Treasury yield dipped to 4.397% ahead of an expected Fed rate cut. Medora Lee is a money, markets and personal finance reporter at USA TODAY.
