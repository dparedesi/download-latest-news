Title: These Stocks Could Post Big Moves After Nvidia Earnings

Nvidia is scheduled to report quarterly results after the bell on Wednesday, in what could be a major test of the AI trade’s resilience. Nvidia earnings are a blockbuster, market-moving event for Wall Street. Investors parse the results for any sign that AI demand or investment is waning, making the report a catalyst for AI infrastructure stocks. Most of these AI stocks are currently trading at or above their price heading into Nvidia's last earnings report at the end of February. Those results weighed heavily on the majority of AI beneficiaries. Shares of server maker Super Micro Computer (SMCI) and nuclear energy provider Vistra (VST) outpaced Nvidia’s (NVDA) 8.5% decline the day after its last report, tumbling 16% and 12%, respectively. Constellation Energy (CEG), also a nuclear power provider, slumped about 7.5%. Nvidia’s position as the world’s largest semiconductor company has made it something of a bellwether for the entire industry. The PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX) tumbled more than 6% after Nvidia’s last report, its biggest decline since January’s DeepSeek panic caused the index to nosedive. Major Nvidia competitors Broadcom (AVGO) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) tumbled 7% and 5%, respectively. Chip fabrication services provider Lam Research (LRCX) and memory chip maker Micron (MU) also closed sharply lower. The companies that supply data centers with essential networking equipment also tend to move on AI demand signals parsed from Nvidia’s earnings. Shares of Arista Networks (ANET) slid 5% following Nvidia’s February report, while fiber optic technology provider Corning (GLW) shed 2% and network provider Lumen Technologies (LUMN) dropped 4%. Granted, stocks within the AI ecosystem don’t always move in tandem. Nvidia shares soared more than 9% on its earnings report one year ago, but the boost its results lent to other AI infrastructure stocks fizzled out before the day’s end. Supermicro shares rose as much as 11% that day before sliding to close 3% lower.

More smartphone in Suqian, Jiangsu province, China on March 9, 2025. (Photo credit should read CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images) Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock is up nearly 45% in the last six months, significantly outperforming the broader Nasdaq index, down 1%. This strong performance is largely due to the company’s rising sales, up 40% in the last twelve months. A major driver of this growth is Broadcom's AI product line, which saw an impressive 220% year-over-year increase in revenue to $12.2 billion in fiscal year 2024, fueled by high demand for its custom AI accelerators (XPUs) and Ethernet products. Broadcom is strategically positioned to capitalize on the generative AI surge with its extensive suite of networking, storage, cybersecurity, and semiconductor offerings. Considering this strong performance, we believe AVGO stock is a good buy at its current price of around $230. While its current valuation is extremely high, making it sensitive to adverse events, we see minimal cause for concern. Our conclusion is based on comparing AVGO's current valuation with its recent operating performance and its current and historical financial health. Our analysis across key parameters—Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience—shows that Broadcom has a very strong operating performance and financial condition. That said, if you seek upside with lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio presents an alternative - having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Also, see – What Sparked UNH Stock Crash? Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, AVGO stock looks very expensive compared to the broader market. Broadcom's Revenues have grown considerably over recent years. Broadcom's profit margins are much higher than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. Broadcom's balance sheet looks strong. AVGO stock has been less resilient than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy, how bad can things get if there is another recession? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes. In summary, Broadcom's performance across the parameters detailed above are as follows: AVGO stock has performed exceptionally well across these parameters. While the stock's valuation is currently high, it appears justifiable given its massive sales growth and solid operating cash flow margins of around 40%. Therefore, despite its extremely high valuation, the stock remains attractive, supporting our conclusion that AVGO is a good buy. However, investors should be aware of certain risks. The stock's high valuation makes it more prone to significant declines during adverse events, as demonstrated by its larger corrections than the broader market in two of the last three market crashes. Additionally, any slowdown in AI spending by companies would directly impact Broadcom's growth. Overall, investors should carefully consider these potential risks before investing in AVGO. Not too happy about the volatile nature of AVGO stock? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
