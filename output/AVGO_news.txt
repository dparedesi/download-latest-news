We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 12 Safe Stocks to Buy for the Long Term in 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other safe stocks to buy for the long term in 2025. The US stock market is often regarded as one of the most reliable and resilient financial markets in the world.

Title: Nvidia Stock Drops Wednesday as AI Chipmaker's Roller-Coaster Week Continues
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/nvidia-stock-drops-wednesday-as-ai-chipmaker-roller-coaster-week-continues-8782483
Time Published: 2025-01-29T18:50:07Z
Full Content:
Nvidia (NVDA) shares tumbled nearly 6% in intraday trading Wednesday, dashing hopes for a quick recovery from losses earlier in the week amid concerns about competitiveness of American AI firms and their spending on the emerging technology. The AI chipmaker's stock led losses in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and was among the top decliners on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Wednesday. Shares of Broadcom (AVGO), Palantir (PLTR), and several other AI darlings over the past year also were lower. The surging popularity of an app from Chinese startup DeepSeek, which runs on an AI model it claimed can perform on par with American rivals at a fraction of the cost, had sent Nvidia and a slew of other U.S. tech stocks into a tailspin Monday. Despite a brief rebound in Tuesday's session, the tech sector fell back into the red Wednesday as Chinese tech giant Alibaba (BABA) rolled out a new AI model it says can outperform models from DeepSeek, OpenAI, and Meta Platforms (META). The rapid rise of lower-cost models from Chinese companies that can compete with those from leading American firms has spurred a reckoning on Wall Street, with earnings from Meta and Microsoft (MSFT) likely to be in the spotlight later tonight as both firms face pressure to prove their AI investments can yield results that justify the costs. Analysts have so far remained mostly bullish on their prospects, with Morgan Stanley analysts telling clients that advances by DeekSeek could prove "positive" for Microsoft and Meta, suggesting Meta could implement them and that Microsoft's Azure platform would benefit from a proliferation of AI models and consumer applications. Bank of America analysts told clients in a note Wednesday they see this as "AI's Sputnik moment," suggesting competition could push U.S. hyperscalers like Microsoft, Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet (GOOGL) to spend even more on AI, to the benefit of Nvidia, Broadcom, and other AI chipmakers. They reiterated a "buy" rating and $190 price target for Nvidia's stock, adding they "view the recent selloff as an enhanced buy opportunity."

Title: 6 Semiconductor ETFs To Buy For 2025

Time Published: 2025-01-28T21:40:44Z

Most U.S. semiconductor ETFs focus on the same 30 semiconductor stocks, varying primarily in their ... [+] weighting methodologies. Semiconductor stocks outpaced the S&P 500 in 2024. The momentum will likely continue as global AI infrastructure spending keeps those chipmakers busy. The recently announced Stargate project funded by OpenAI, SoftBank, Oracle and MGX is an example. Stargate is slated to pour $500 billion into AI data centers over the next four years. Despite China's recent announcement about its DeepSeek technology, semiconductor stocks still have bright futures. A diversified semiconductor ETF is a smart choice if you are new to this space. Below, you will meet six high-performing semiconductor funds—one of which could fit nicely in your ETF portfolio. The universe of semiconductor ETFs is small. There are about two dozen of them in total. The list shrinks to about 10 when you exclude leveraged and inverse funds. Leverage funds use debt to amplify returns, but this also increases risk. Inverse funds produce the opposite return of an underlying index. So, if a semiconductor index rises 10%, the inverse ETF would lose 10%. Because leveraged and inverse funds are too risky for most investors, they are excluded from this list. The 10 remaining funds were sorted on their one-year total returns. Total return includes appreciation and dividends. None are dividend ETFs per se, but they do pay small yields. The list of 10 was then trimmed to the top six semiconductor ETFs, ordered from highest to lowest return. The table below introduces six semiconductor ETFs with total one-year returns ranging from 11.89% to 39.69%. Read on for an overview of each semiconductor fund. Metrics are current as of January 27 after close of trading. For more investing ideas, see best ETFs for 2025 and income investing ETFs. SMH tracks the results of the MVIS U.S. Listed Semiconductor Index. The index and the fund include the 25 largest U.S. exchange-traded stocks that generate 50% or more of their revenues from semiconductors. The stocks are market-cap-weighted with a maximum weighting of 20%. VanEck's semiconductor ETF is the only pick on this list tracking the MVIS domestic semiconductor index. It is also the only fund that returned more than 30% to its shareholders over the last year. The secret is the aggressive weighting of Nvidia (NVDA) at 19.19% and Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) at 12.96%. This one-two punch of semiconductor stocks has delivered huge gains over the past year, but the combination is risky. Nvidia is TSM's second-largest customer, so the companies' futures are linked. This ETF bets heavily that Nvidia and, by association, TSM will continue monetizing the AI buildout. If Nvidia stumbles, you might regret the fund's high concentration of those two stocks. The Columbia ETF is an actively managed fund that invests in semiconductor companies with promising, long-term growth potential. Selection factors include the quality of the management team and intellectual property. Stocks in the portfolio are weighted by conviction—so the highest-potential securities, as determined by fund manager analysis, are held in the largest quantities. The stocks in the SEMI portfolio are picked by humans who continually research and analyze the semiconductor space. Other ETFs on this list use an index to define their holdings. The human component creates the potential to beat index performance. The trade-off is a higher expense ratio since actively managed funds are more expensive to operate. Nvidia and Broadcom are the two largest holdings. Combined, they account for more than 40% of this fund's portfolio. To date, SEMI's returns have been competitive but not segment-leading. Strive's semiconductor ETF tracks the Bloomberg U.S. Listed Semiconductors Select Total Return Index. The index and fund include the top 30 semiconductor stocks weighted with a modified market cap formula. The maximum weighting is 22.5% and the cumulative weight of stocks comprising more than 4.5% of the index is capped at 45%. Strive's fund was launched in October 2022, making it the youngest fund on this list. It has the highest average annual return since inception, partially due to good timing. The fund launched just as tech stocks started rebounding from a tough 2022. SHOC has benefited from high concentrations in Nvidia and Broadcom. The fund currently holds these stocks at 20.02% and 17.57%, respectively. ASML Holding NV (ASML) is also a top holding at 8.98%. The remaining positions are weighted at 4.5% or lower. The SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF tracks an index of semiconductor stocks in the S&P Total Market Index. As of January 2025, there are 41 companies in the index and the fund, and individual weightings are capped at 4.5%. The SPDR semiconductor fund includes large, mid and small cap stocks using a modified equal-weighting system. With a larger portfolio and an exposure limit of 4.5% on any one security, XSD is the most balanced of the funds on this list. Broadcom is the largest holding at 3.93%, while Nvidia is the 12th largest position at 3.01%. This fund is a nice choice for investors who want diversified exposure to smaller semiconductor stocks such as Diodes Incorporated (DIOD) and Ambarella (AMBA). Invesco's original semiconductor ETF, PSI, tracks the Dynamic Semiconductor Intellidex℠ Index. Intellidex indexes identify companies with high capital gains potential by analyzing price and earnings momentum, quality, management and value. The index and fund use a modified equal-weighting system so individual stock exposures have a limited range of 1.74% to 6.47%. PSI's modified equal-weighting system reduces over-concentration risk in mega-tech stocks Nvidia and Broadcom (AVGO). Broadcom is the fund's top holding, weighted at 6.73%, and Nvidia is number five, weighted at 4.76%. This weighting system removes Nvidia's dominance and allows smaller companies more influence over the group's performance. PSI has delivered solid growth in the past year, without relying on one or two tickers. This fund is a good choice for investors wanting more balanced exposure to the semiconductor space. PHLX is Invesco's newer semiconductor ETF, launched in 2021. The fund tracks the PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index, which includes the largest, U.S.-listed 30 semiconductor stocks. The stocks are weighted by market capitalization with some limitations. For example, the top three positions cannot exceed 12%, 10% and 8%, respectively. SOXQ has the lowest expense ratio and the second-highest dividend yield among the ETFs here. The fund's weighting system moderates over-concentration risk while allowing the big players some room to carry the portfolio's performance. SOXQ also includes 4.45% exposure to Taiwan Semiconductor, which is left out of several other funds. Most U.S. semiconductor ETFs focus on the same 30 semiconductor stocks, varying primarily in their weighting methodologies. Market-weighted funds depend on the biggest companies, while equal-weighted funds capture more growth from smaller companies. Your risk tolerance and investing philosophy can reveal which strategy suits you best. Do you believe in letting growth stocks run? If yes, then choose a market-weighted fund. If you worry that ever-rising stock prices may ultimately retreat, opt for equal weighting. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

Title: Broadcom Inc. (AVGO): Jim Cramer’s Thoughts on the AI-Driven Surge – Here’s Why
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/broadcom-inc-avgo-jim-cramer-180724984.html
Time Published: 2025-01-28T18:07:24Z

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Jim Cramer’s Bold Predictions About These 12 AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other AI stocks that Jim Cramer has made predictions about. Given that AI has dominated stock market headlines for more than a year now, it’s no surprise that Jim Cramer of CNBC’s Mad Money and Squawk on the Street has also devoted quite a bit of airtime discussing the technology. He is extremely bullish on AI and has gone as far as to suggest that the world’s largest AI GPU company, the one run by Jensen Huang, is ushering in a new industrial revolution. Don’t believe us? Well, take a look at his own words. In a recent Squawk on the Street appearance, Cramer said the following about Huang and his company: “Industrial revolution, why can’t we believe? Do you remember, did you read that, book about John Garfield, where they talked about the telephone, and Alexander Graham Bell tries to get it into the centennial in Philadelphia, and only because the Brazilian guy there doesn’t get to represent it. And Alexander Graham Bell says you know this could revolutionize all of how we do things. And the American judges were like who is this clown?” One major AI announcement in January that has created quite a bit of a splash is President Trump’s $500 billion Stargate project. Trump announced the project joined by executives from several big tech companies. Cramer believes that Stargate might end up underpinning industrial growth in the US. Stargate might also require the US to build the energy infrastructure necessary to support massive data centers. According to Cramer: “Crisis comes down to the fact that we had no real industrial growth in this country for decades so we haven’t had to build much energy infrastructure. Now all of a sudden these data centers start coming online like the ones that will be part of Stargate, the Oracle, SoftBank, OpenAI project… And these data centers consume insane amounts of electricity. It’s a level of demand that nobody saw coming. So after years where we spent more time decommissioning power plants and building new ones, we suddenly gotta go back into growth mode.” These aren’t his only comments about Stargate. Cramer believes that the announcement might underlie a new paradigm shift in the US ecosystem. This ecosystem blossomed through the partnership between Bill Gates’ software company and OpenAI. However, Cramer believes that the shares of one of the world’s largest enterprise resource planning companies soared after the announcement because “maybe because there’s a reshuffling of the alliance. And the alliance could be in play.” He believes that “the fluid nature of things here is rather extraordinary” and that the firm might have replaced the software company: “[the ERP provider] might have replaced Microsoft in an OpenAI joint venture. This would be extraordinary. And you know Carl, I don’t know whether Ellison [Larry Ellison] was doing a dance yesterday because he was so happy about this announcement. Or because he may have a real coup here. And betting against Ellison has been one of the biggest fools game in history. Man he was on his game yesterday.” The booming demand for energy from AI data centers has injected fresh life into nuclear power companies. Some of these firms are up by a whopping 186% year-to-date. While Cramer is skeptical about the near-term returns offered by nuclear power stocks, one energy source that he believes might become popular again is coal. Here’s what he said in a recent Mad Money episode: “Under this president, coal could have… a renaissance. Sure, coal’s time has come and gone, but it will come again because the data center inspired energy crisis really is so pressing that there’s not really a choice anymore. Yes, the demand is that great, [and] we so foolishly mothballed good nuke plants that it wouldn’t surprise me if coal’s long decline may have finally run its course.” To compile our list of Jim Cramer’s bold predictions about AI stocks, we scanned the stocks he mentioned in Mad Money and Squawk on the Street as far back as September 2024. Then, we picked out AI stocks and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit. Number of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 128 Date of Cramer’s Comments: 09-11-24 Performance Since Then: 54.61% Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is one of the largest and most valuable semiconductor companies in the world. Its shares have been on a tear since Cramer’s remarks and have added a whopping 54.6% in gains. All of these gains have come primarily on the back of blowout announcements by management in December. In December, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)’s shares surged by an unbelievable 62.2% as the company shared that it expected to earn up to $70 billion from selling AI chips in 2027. At the same time, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) also forecast a 22% revenue growth for its Q1 Fy25. Here’s what Cramer had shared in September: “Did you know that today Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) traded above where it was sitting before the aforementioned quarter, which I told you was good anyway? The one that seemed to be hated but now seems to be transforming from an ugly duck into a beautiful, but angry, swan. Have you ever noticed swans are really angry? Look, we’re in a highly emotional market.” Overall, AVGO ranks 5th on our list of AI stocks that Jim Cramer has made predictions about. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: How DeepSeek’s AI Model Impacts AVGO Stock?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/01/28/how-deepseeks-ai-model-impacts-avgo-stock/
Time Published: 2025-01-28T14:58:31Z

CANADA - 2025/01/06: In this photo illustration, the Broadcom company logo is seen displayed on a ... [+] smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ: AVGO), a semiconductor, enterprise software, and security solutions provider, saw its stock plunge over 17% on Monday, January 27. This can be attributed to the ripples DeepSeek created, sending tremors through the Silicon Valley. DeepSeek’s more efficient approach challenges the conventional wisdom that bigger and more expensive necessarily means better in AI development. The Chinese AI lab DeepSeek recently made waves by releasing their DeepSeek-R1 model as open-source software. What makes this noteworthy is that according to the lab’s research, DeepSeek-R1 achieves better performance than prominent models like OpenAI’s o1 and Meta’s Llama across various metrics. The model stands out not just for its performance, but also because it’s freely available, cost-efficient, and demands less computing resources than competitors. This development has caused concerns in the west, where major tech companies have typically focused on a resource-intensive approach — accumulating massive amounts of computing infrastructure. The situation could have particular significance for Broadcom’s stock, as they’ve emerged as a key player in AI networking technology. But also see DeepSeek Could Boost Intel Stock. Broadcom’s revenue of 51.6 billion in fiscal 2024 (fiscal ends in October) was up a stellar 44% y-o-y. This can partly be attributed to the contribution from VMware, which it acquired for $69 billion in late 2023. Apart from VMware, Broadcom’s AI products contributed to its top-line growth. The company’s AI revenue in fiscal 2024 stood at $12.2 billion, reflecting a whopping 220% y-o-y growth, driven by strong demand for its AI XPUs (Broadcom’s custom AI accelerators) and Ethernet products. Broadcom is benefiting from the generative AI boom, with its wide suite of networking and storage solutions, cybersecurity, and semiconductor offerings. Broadcom also announced that it’s developing AI chips with three large cloud companies, which reportedly include Google and Meta. Broadcom’s business relies heavily on their networking products, which are crucial for data transfer in AI systems. If the market for premium AI chips experiences a downturn, amid the rise of DeepSeek, it could create a domino effect, potentially hurting sales of Broadcom’s supporting technologies and components. Investors have assigned a higher valuation multiple for AVGO stock, taking into account the expected AI contribution. With the rise of DeepSeek, the investors are now concerned about the sales growth may be slower than earlier anticipated. AVGO stock has seen a solid 84% rise since the beginning of 2024, significantly outperforming the broader S&P500 index, up 26%. Admirably, AVGO stock has generated better returns than the broader market in each of the last four years. Returns for the stock were 56% in 2021, -13% in 2022, 104% in 2023, and 110% in 2024. Similarly, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment, with changes in the White House, and the DeepSeek update, could AVGO see a strong jump? We think that investors should tread with caution. This potential shift in the industry toward efficiency over raw power, combined with a broader slowdown, could create additional challenges for Broadcom’s business prospects. While AVGO stock took a plunge amid the rise of DeepSeek, it is helpful to see how Broadcom’s Peers fare on metrics that matter.

Nvidia (NVDA-4.02%) stock saw a slight turnaround Tuesday morning after the chipmaker suffered its biggest single-day market value loss because of an artificial intelligence chatbot challenger in China. Shares of the AI chipmaker were up 2% in pre-market trading, after closing down almost 17% on Monday, to $118.58. Nvidia shed almost $600 billion in value in a single day, the largest of any U.S. company in history, and lost its spot as the world’s most valuable company, bringing its market capitalization to $2.9 trillion. Other major chip stocks also sank Monday, including ASML (ASML+0.16%), Broadcom (AVGO+2.39%), Super Micro Computer (SMCI-0.38%), Micron (MU-1.11%), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM+0.19%) That sent the tech-heavy Nasdaq down more than 3%. In all, markets saw roughly $1 trillion in market cap loss to start the week. Traders fled the tech sector in response to Chinese firm DeepSeek’s announcement last week that it launched a model that rivals OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Meta’s (META-0.04%) Llama 3.1 — and which rose to the top of Apple’s (AAPL-1.60%) App Store over the weekend. Some analysts warned that DeepSeek’s model, which was built using less energy and with lower cost chips, could pose a threat to U.S. dominance of AI development. As its stock plunged, Nvidia said in a statement Monday that DeepSeek is “an excellent AI advancement and a perfect example of Test Time Scaling.” “DeepSeek’s work illustrates how new models can be created using that technique, leveraging widely available models and compute that is fully export control compliant. Inference requires significant numbers of NVIDIA GPUs and high-performance networking,” a spokesperson said. Markets were relatively flat as of Tuesday morning, with Nasdaq futures up just 0.11%. Contracts for the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 46 points, and S&P 500 futures ticked up 0.05%. Broadcom also rose almost 3%. The sell-off Monday underscored just how concentrated the market has become. Leaders in the AI and chip space, including the so-called Magnificent 7 stocks, drove much of the market’s returns in 2024. Economists at Goldman Sachs (GS-1.03%) have warned that the “extremely high level of market concentration” poses significant risks to future returns from the broader market. The analysts said the premium valuation for the top 10 stocks is the largest since the peak of the dot-com bubble in 2000. These 10 companies, which include Apple, Microsoft (MSFT+0.25%), Amazon (AMZN+1.17%), Nvidia, Alphabet (GOOGL+1.33%), and Meta, accounted for 36% of the S&P 500 and drove much of the index’s returns last year.

Title: Jim Cramer’s Broadcom (AVGO) Prediction Was Spot On

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Jim Cramer is Talking About These 10 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer is talking about. Jim Cramer in a latest program on CNBC discussed the reasons behind the recent market declines after the ISM Services Index data. Cramer said many are still expecting more rate cuts from the Federal Reserve soon but they are wrong. “This survey showed surprising strength, so much strength that it makes you think that the FED might not give us more rate cuts anytime soon. Right now, a ton of investors believe that the FED needs to push through a bunch of rate cuts in order to revive the economy. Lots of those bulls are counting on those cuts. That seems wrong today. They were rocked to the core because not only have they been wrong, but they’re starting to question the FED’s credibility. They know nothing,” Cramer said. Cramer said he was “mystified” by the Fed’s rate cuts amid strong economic data. “These traders are wondering why the heck the FED cut short rates by 50 basis points September then give another 25 in November another 25 in December what the heck did they see that made them so aggressive judging by the data. Nothing. The credibility issue, if you claim you’re data dependent, and the data is strong then why the heck are you cutting so aggressively.” Cramer at the time said the latest nonfarm payrolls report would be one of the most important indicators of the economy and it would set the “dialog” in the coming days. Sure it will. The latest jobs data showed unemployment fell and job additions crushed Wall Street expectations. Many now believe the Fed is set to put brakes on rate cuts.

With each company, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 128 In early November, answering a question about a company, Jim Cramer said: “The semiconductor stocks are so hated that I have to urge you to buy a regular semiconductor right now because they are being put for sale like you wouldn’t believe. But go buy Broadcom, go buy Broadcom, AVGO, and you will like it more than Ultra. I’ll tell you, really.” Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) continues to be a leader in the AI ASCI and networking chips market. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) has 3nm AI ASIC chip deals with Alphabet and Meta in addition to many other tech giants aiming massive spending for AI hyperscaling. However, the stock could face the impact of what Nvidia is facing today: too high expectations. In the latest quarterly results, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) revenue was largely in line with estimates. The company has narrowly exceeded revenue expectations by less than 5% in most cases. Some analysts suggest Broadcom’s growth rates will moderate to below 20% CAGR starting the first quarter of 2025. In fiscal Q4, it was +50% topline growth. The market won’t be kind to the stock when the revenue growth rate slows. Broadcom has about $58 billion in net debt, which is relatively high. Columbia Threadneedle Global Technology Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Similar to the earnings results for Nvidia, shares of Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) initially sold off after the company reported solid earnings that fell light of elevated market expectations, but the stock did recover from its drawdown in the matter of a few weeks. With an enticing combination of custom chip offerings as well as networking assets, Broadcom remains one of the best positioned companies as part of the AI revolution. Broadcom outlined a path to derive a majority of its revenue from the AI end market within a couple of years, and the non-AI part of the business has stabilized after a deep correction. The company’s dominant market position in its end markets, along with durable growth, strong margins and best-in-class capital allocation, presents an opportunity to compound capital over time.” Overall, AVGO ranks 1st on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer is talking about. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.
