Title: Buy or Sell AVGO Stock at $340?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/10/buy-or-sell-avgo-stock-at-340/

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Broadcom’s stock surged 13% over the past week, following strong earnings, optimistic guidance, and a significant new order for $10 billion in custom AI chips. The key question for investors now is whether the stock is a buy at its current price of $360. We believe there is not much to fear in AVGO stock, given its overall very strong operating performance and financial condition. Therefore, despite its very high valuation, the stock appears attractive. Here is our multi-factor assessment. Separately, also look at our take on potential 2x upside for AVGO stock. Still, no matter how attractive, investing in a single stock carries high risk. Trefis High Quality Portfolio is designed to reduce stock-specific risk while giving upside exposure. Let's get into details of each of the assessed factors, but before that, a quick background: With $1.6 Tril in market cap, Broadcom provides semiconductor devices and software solutions, including set-top box system-on-chips, cable, DSL, and passive optical networking products across semiconductor and infrastructure software segments. This table highlights how AVGO is valued vs the broader market. For more details, see: AVGO Valuation Ratios This table highlights how AVGO is growing vs the broader market. For more details see: AVGO Revenue Comparison This table highlights how AVGO’s profitability compares with the broader market. For more details, see: AVGO Operating Income Comparison AVGO saw an impact slightly better than the S&P 500 index during various economic downturns. We assess this based on both (a) how much the stock fell and (b) how quickly it recovered. But the risk is not limited to major market crashes. Stocks fall even when markets are good—think events like earnings, business updates, or outlook changes. Read AVGO Dip Buyer Analyses to see how the stock has recovered from sharp dips in the past. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming its benchmark that includes all 3 - S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index—less of a roller-coaster ride—as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Lululemon Stock: Buy The Dip Or Wait It Out?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/09/lululemon-stock-buy-the-dip-or-wait-it-out/
Time Published: 2025-09-09T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Lululemon stock (NASDAQ: LULU) has emerged as one of the more divisive names in the market for 2025. A mix of guidance reductions, tariff challenges, and decreasing product momentum has resulted in a 56% decline in shares year-to-date, while the S&P 500 has risen by 10%. This discrepancy raises an important question: has the market reacted excessively, or are the threats to growth and profitability more fundamental? Valuation introduces another dimension to this discussion. Once regarded as a high-growth premium brand, Lululemon is now trading at just 14 times trailing earnings, presenting a discount compared to its historical average and the market's 24 times multiple. Financially, the company continues to yield strong margins, returns on capital, and free cash flow. With a market cap of $20 billion and $1.4 billion in trailing free cash flow, the stock offers a cash flow yield of nearly 7%. When compared to competitors like Nike, this positioning seems appealing — although whether the multiple will adjust upward relies on management's capability to stimulate U.S. demand while managing rising costs. For investors who prefer lower volatility compared to individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio offers an alternative, having surpassed the S&P 500 and produced returns of over 91% since its launch. Additionally, check out Broadcom: AVGO Stock’s Path To $600 Lululemon exceeded earnings expectations with an EPS of $3.10 compared to estimates of $2.87, though revenue slightly missed at $2.53B against projections of $2.54B. The main issue, however, was the reduction in guidance. The company lowered its full-year revenue forecast to $10.85B–$11.0B (down from $11.15B–$11.3B) and EPS to $12.77–$12.97 (down from $14.58–$14.78). This adjustment, rather than the quarterly performance itself, caused the most recent selloff in the stock. Lululemon’s U.S. same-store sales in Q2 FY 2025 decreased by 4%, indicating ongoing weakness in its core domestic market. Conversely, same-store sales increased by 17% in China and by 12% across other international markets. Lululemon is contending with various challenges beyond its guidance. The elimination of the U.S. de minimis exemption will result in roughly $240 million in additional import duties, leading to an overall operating cost impact estimated at around $320 million by 2026. Management has also recognized brand fatigue, with CEO Calvin McDonald mentioning that the assortment has grown “too predictable.” To address this issue, the company intends to refresh its offerings, increasing the proportion of new styles from 23% to 35% by next spring. Lululemon concluded the quarter with $1.2 billion in cash, which represents 15.4% of total assets, against $1.7 billion in lease liabilities, its primary form of debt. This results in a conservative debt-to-equity ratio of merely 8.3%. With no traditional debt on the balance sheet and substantial liquidity, the company is well-equipped to withstand short-term disruptions without compromising its growth ambitions. There’s no denying it: Lululemon has a track record of significant declines during market corrections. It decreased by 46% in the downturn of 2022 (compared to the S&P’s 25%), fell 47% during the early 2020 Covid shock (versus 34%), and faced a severe drop of 92% in the 2008 crash (in contrast to 57%). Investors must recognize that with LULU, strong fundamentals do not always provide protection against sharp changes in sentiment. View LULU Dip Buyer Analyses to discover how the stock has bounced back from significant dips in the past. Lululemon’s fundamentals — solid margins, global growth, and a clean balance sheet — remain robust, while the stock’s valuation has adjusted to attractive levels. The business continues to be premium, but the price is no longer reflective of that. Investing in a single stock carries inherent risks. Alternatively, you might consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its benchmark consisting of all-cap stocks (a mix of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to yield significant returns for investors. What accounts for that? The quarterly rebalanced structure of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks has provided an adaptable means to capitalize on favorable market conditions while minimizing losses during downturns, as illustrated in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: S&P 500 Gains and Losses Today: Uber Stock Drives Higher; CVS Slides

Time Published: 2025-09-08T21:34:02Z

Major U.S. equities indexes ticked higher as markets kicked off a new trading week. Inflation is likely to remain in focus as investors look toward Thursday's release of the latest Consumer Price Index data, which could influence the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates next week. The S&P 500 added 0.2% Monday, while the Nasdaq rose 0.5% to a record closing high, and the Dow ended 0.3% higher. Shares of video game maker Take-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) surged 3.8% to reach an all-time high and secure the top daily performance in the S&P 500 after the company launched its latest professional basketball game and announced plans to develop a college basketball game. Uber Technologies (UBER) shares drove 3.7% higher after it announced plans with self-driving technology firm Momenta to begin testing autonomous vehicles in Munich, Germany, in 2026. The company also moved to sell $2.25 billion in investment-grade bonds, Bloomberg reported, with the proceeds directed toward general corporate purposes. Shares of Broadcom (AVGO) added 3.2%, extending strong gains late last week after the chipmaker reported better-than-expected earnings. A surge in artificial intelligence revenue underpinned the strong performance, and Broadcom said it had secured $10 billion in orders from a new client, which reports said could be OpenAI. CVS Health (CVS) shares dropped 4.8%, losing the most of any stock in the S&P 500 on Monday, after top executives at a Morgan Stanley investor conference did not offer new financial forecasts or updates on the federal government's impending release of star ratings for Medicare Advantage plans, which could have a significant impact on revenue CVS derives from plans operated through its Aetna insurance business. One of the executives speaking at the conference reportedly stressed CVS has a policy of not updating its guidance between quarterly earnings releases. Shares of alcoholic beverage maker Brown-Forman (BF.B) fell 4.6%. The stock has been trending downward since the Jack Daniel's parent last month posted a lower-than-expected profit. The company noted a negative impact from the ongoing trade dispute between the U.S. and Canada. The company said it also faces headwinds related to economic uncertainty and the potential for price pressure related to oversupply in the American whiskey market. Including Monday's decline, Brown-Forman shares have lost more than one-quarter of their value this year. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings (NCLH) announced a plan to offer around $3.25 billion in senior and exchangeable notes, as well as launch a registered direct offering of ordinary shares. The former adds to the company's debt levels, while the latter dilutes the ownership stake of existing stockholders. Shares of the cruise operator sank 4.4% on Monday.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. During the week ending September 5, the S&P 500 was essentially unchanged, slipping 0.12%. In contrast, several S&P 500 constituents—particularly AI-related names—posted strong gains. The week’s top movers were propelled by upbeat quarterly surprises, sizable chip agreements, and constructive regulatory developments. Macroeconomic data pointed to a softer labor market: nonfarm payrolls in August rose by only 22,000, well below the 75,000 forecast, while the unemployment rate edged up to 4.3%. Together, these readings reinforce expectations that the Federal Reserve will move forward with a widely anticipated interest rate cut later this month. We detail the biggest movers below. That said, if you’re seeking upside with less volatility than a single-stock position, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outpaced its blended benchmark—the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—with returns exceeding 91% since inception. Also, see – S&P 500 Losers: From Lululemon To MGM — What Went Wrong? Western Digital’s stock climbed 15% last week on a strong earnings print and upbeat guidance for the coming quarters. WDC has nearly doubled in 2025, riding the AI wave as its high-performance storage is critical for AI data centers. At $93, WDC trades at about 2x trailing revenues, modestly above its five-year average P/S of 1.7x. The relative discount to its historical average, as well as some peers, reflects its heavier exposure to the more volatile NAND segment, recent market drawdowns, and historical concerns about earnings cyclicality. Broadcom advanced 13% last week, buoyed by strong quarterly results and news of a new $10 billion custom AI chip order from a major customer—seen as a meaningful accelerant to revenue growth. Our recent analysis — AVGO Stock To $400 — outlines how Broadcom could potentially double again after a 135% gain over the last twelve months. The company is leveraging deep semiconductor expertise to deliver bespoke AI hardware for hyperscale, cloud, and enterprise buyers. Seagate shares rose 12%, supported by expectations for sustained AI-driven storage demand, with the stock up 115% year to date. The enthusiasm for high-capacity drives used in AI workloads has pushed STX’s valuation, now at 4x trailing revenues—well above its five-year average of 1.9x. That premium suggests the market is pricing in elevated demand and earnings durability. Micron gained 10%, largely on rising demand for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) in AI infrastructure. Micron’s revenue multiple is 3.9x, close to its five-year average, implying today’s pricing reflects both current strength and cyclical risks—particularly as DRAM has entered an upcycle after a tough 2024, while NAND remains subdued. Even so, Micron may be AI’s best bargain. Google advanced 10% after a key regulatory win—a federal court found it wouldn’t need to divest Chrome, a platform we estimate is worth over a trillion to the ecosystem. The stock still appears relatively undervalued versus peers, with potential for an additional trillion-dollar upswing if further rulings are favorable; another decision due on September 10 could shape the next move. Remember, investing in a single stock—or a small handful—carries meaningful risk. Consider the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, a 30-stock collection that has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why? As a group, HQ names have delivered better returns with less volatility versus the benchmark—less of a roller-coaster ride—visible in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
