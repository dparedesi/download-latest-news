After taking a beating for the past week, chip stocks climbed Tuesday morning as part of a broader market rally. Nvidia (NVDA+15.78%) shares had lost almost 15% over the previous three trading sessions but had clawed back 8% by midday Tuesday before retreating slightly. Meanwhile, other leading chip makers, including Broadcom (AVGO+15.27%), Intel (INTC+15.61%), Micron Technology (MU+16.27%), Lam Research (LRCX+15.47%), Applied Materials (AMAT+13.65%), Samsung, and Cisco (CSCO+8.03%) were also up Tuesday. Nvidia’s slide accelerated last week after HSBC analyst Frank Lee downgraded the stock from a “buy” to a “hold,” noting that Nvidia’s earnings and guidance beats in the last three quarters have been shrinking due to “increasing market focus on Nvidia’s earnings as well ongoing uncertainty over its Blackwell supply chain ramp-up.” Meanwhile, other chip stocks were getting better reviews from analysts. For instance, GuruFocus research shows that Broadcom has received a “Strong Buy” rating from nearly 88% of brokerage analysts. Trump’s trade war had sunk chip stocks as fears over slowing demand and high prices took hold. However, semiconductors are exempt from new tariff rates imposed on a slate of countries, which should insulate chip makers from some tariff turmoil. Also of concern: Data centers planned by major IT companies have been delayed or shelved as uncertainty surrounding ROI increases. Microsoft (MSFT+8.32%) announced yesterday that it has abandoned its $1 billion data center project in Licking County, Ohio, citing a strategic investment review. Data centers are a key driver of chip manufacturing growth. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

ByCatherine Brock ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. Nvidia has continued AI growth, plus opportunities in robotics, PC gaming and autonomous driving ... More that make it an attractive buy at the current valuation.&nbsp; You can buy Nvidia stock on the cheap right now, but should you? That’s the question many investors have been asking since the once-unstoppable NVDA stock fell to its lowest P/E ratio since early 2019. Get your answer now with this look at what happened to Nvidia, factors that could spark a rebound and risks ahead for the company. Nvidia stock gained 168% in the first 10 months of 2024 as investors bought up shares to get their piece of the AI boom. The stock price rally peaked in early November and then turned south when investors got nervous about lingering high interest rates. The negative trend for Nvidia deepened in 2025 as a series of headlines prompted many to question the chip designer’s growth outlook: January through early April, Nvidia stock is down almost 30%. The AI buildout has driven Nvidia's growth in recent years. Nvidia's AI data center sales are still increasing, but the pace has slowed and competition could become a factor soon. A full Nvidia rebound will likely require a different kind of breakthrough. Three opportunity areas to watch are robotics, PC gaming and autonomous driving. Huang recently valued the opportunity in AI-powered robotics and automation at $50 trillion. The CEO says these technologies will "transform manufacturing, logistics, healthcare and other industries." Nvidia has two platforms, Isaac and Cosmos, that support robotics and other types of physical AI. Nvidia’s GeForce Now service uses the cloud to upgrade the gaming experience on any PC. Gamers connect their PC gaming accounts at Steam, Epic Games Store or Ubisoft Connect to GeForce Now for added hardware support—essentially turning any device into a gaming PC. Nvidia announced expanded GeForce Now device support and capabilities at the 2025 CES trade show. Nvidia’s automotive line-up includes a platform for in-vehicle computing plus solutions for training AI driving models and simulating environments for testing. In 2025, the company announced automotive AI partnerships with Toyota, Aurora, Continental, GM, Gatik and Torc. Nvidia expects its automotive business to deliver fiscal 2026 revenue of $5 billion, up from $1.7 billion in fiscal 2025. Alongside these opportunities, Nvidia faces some challenges. Regulatory changes, cheaper AI solutions and in-house chip development top the list. Changing Trump administration policies could pressure Nvidia’s stock price. Reciprocal tariffs, even with semiconductors excluded, could raise input costs and reduce margins. While Huang seems unbothered by the trade war developments, he also said he could move manufacturing to the U.S. if needed. That is a long-term solution. Unfortunately, growth investors are not known for their patience. A transition to domestic manufacturing would impact the NVDA stock price. More concerning than tariffs is the potential for export bans to China and import bans by China. Reports indicate Trump has considered tighter limits on chip sales to China. Meanwhile, Chinese regulators are discouraging sales of Nvidia's H20 chip—a product designed for export to China—because it doesn't meet efficiency standards, according to the Financial Times. The rollout of DeepSeek caused angst for Nvidia shareholders. At issue was the $5.6 million total investment quoted by the AI app’s creator. The price tag seems tiny next to, say, Microsoft's $80 billion AI budget for fiscal 2025. The discrepancy prompted questions about Nvidia's growth outlook. If DeepSeek can do it, why can't big tech spend far less on Nvidia's AI hardware for the same results? Some experts have said the $5.6 million number from DeepSeek is misleading. Still, there will be a time when cost-efficiency enters the AI fray. That could create space for competitors to chip away at Nvidia's AI dominance. Big tech companies don’t want Nvidia to be the only AI chip game in town. It's too risky. They are mitigating that risk by developing in-house solutions. Alphabet (GOOG) recently introduced a collection of lightweight open-source AI models, Meta (META) is testing an AI chip and OpenAI has nearly finalized the design of its AI chip. These solutions will reduce Nvidia's business with existing customers over time. Nvidia will have to improve on performance and price as a result. Nvidia is an attractive, long-term buy right now despite regulatory and competitive challenges. The stock may not return to its pre-Trump growth rates, but it is an innovative, healthy company with a forward-thinking leader—and those qualities usually create shareholder value over time. Like many growth stocks, NVDA is volatile. Its per-share price can fall as quickly as it rises. You can see that dynamic in play for NVDA stock since it went public in 1999. So this stock is best suited for hardy, patient investors and those who already own NVDA and want to reduce their average cost basis. If you don't feel quite ready for NVDA, see this list of best stocks for 2025 for more investing ideas. Bottom Line Nvidia is down nearly 30% this year as investors worry about tariffs, trade bans and lower-cost AI models. But the chip designer is not down for the count. Nvidia has continued AI growth, plus opportunities in robotics, PC gaming and autonomous driving that make it an attractive buy at the current valuation. After the recent downturn, Nvidia’s P/E ratio is about 32. That compares favorably to other semiconductor companies, including Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO) and Arm Holdings (ARM). Nvidia is a well-run company that can navigate financial downturns and industry shifts. Relative to its history, the company's current valuation is appealing. If you don't mind volatility and believe in the AI promise as well as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, now is a good time to buy Nvidia stock. The biggest risks for Nvidia are margin degradation from tariffs, the global impact of tariffs, import and export bans and waning demand if others can replicate DeepSeek's low-power AI model.

Title: Chips mostly dodged Trump's tariffs, but that could soon change

When President Donald Trump announced his reciprocal tariffs this week that sent global markets into a panic, a few exemptions were made, including for semiconductors. In addition to the country-by-country reciprocal tariffs, including 34% for China and 32% for Taiwan, Trump introduced a minimum baseline tariff of 10% on imports from all other countries. However, the White House said some goods, such as steel and auto parts already subject to tariffs, and energy and minerals not available in the U.S., are not subject to the reciprocal tariffs. While semiconductors are also on this list, Jefferies (JEF+13.87%) analysts said in a note on Friday that “this is because President Trump is considering additional sector-specific tariffs on those items.” And although it’s not a direct impact yet, the tariffs will still “have significant ramifications on end demand for” the electronics and devices that semiconductors are inside of, the analysts said, because the prices for those items will climb. Jefferies expects the tariffs to continue pressuring chip stocks such as Nvidia (NVDA+15.78%), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD+20.19%), Broadcom (AVGO+15.27%), and Marvell (MRVL+17.99%), “which all purchase the majority of their chips from TSMC (TSM+9.80%)” in Taiwan. The analysts also expect stock pressure for companies that have end markets that rely on the Chinese supply chain, namely Apple (AAPL+8.29%). “[W]e expect there to be more Semis restrictions/tariffs coming up given concerns over national security which are elevated for this administration,” Jefferies analysts said, adding that they “see potential for further export restrictions” in addition to chip-specific tariffs. Meanwhile, Bloomberg reported last week that foreign government officials and tech company leaders are asking the Trump administration to relax some rules under the Framework for Artificial Intelligence Diffusion, which aims to control which countries, including U.S. allies, can import advanced semiconductors needed for AI development. Known as the AI diffusion rule, the framework puts countries into three different tiers, and outlines how many chips countries can import, where the chips can be deployed, and how nations can work together on AI. The rules came out at the tail end of the Biden administration. With the May 15 deadline to be in compliance looming, foreign governments and tech companies reportedly want the Trump administration to rethink some restrictions out of worries that the rules could hamper AI development and investment.

The Nasdaq Composite was on track to fall into a bear market on Friday as the tariff-induced global stock sell-off deepened. The Nasdaq was recently down nearly 4% Friday morning, putting the index more than 20% off its December all-time high. The tech-heavy index was sliding alongside the other major large-cap indexes, with the S&P 500 off about 4% and the Dow down about 3.5%. The Nasdaq will have to close below 16,139.11 for a bear market to be confirmed. The index was recently trading at 15876 after rebounding from its session low below of 15600. The Nasdaq on Thursday had its worst day since March 2020 after President Donald Trump outlined a raft of steep tariffs that economists warn risk pushing the U.S. economy into a recession while stoking inflation. The sell-off continued Friday after China hit back with its own tariff on all US goods, matching the rate on Chinese goods announced by Trump. The move raised concerns that Trump’s reciprocal tariffs could be the beginning of a global trade war that results in even higher tariffs than those already announced. The majority of the more than 3,000 stocks in the Nasdaq were trading in the red on Friday, but mega-cap tech stocks were weighing most heavily on the index. Shares of Apple (AAPL) were down more than 4% after tumbling nearly 10% yesterday, their worst day since March 2020. AI chipmakers Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO) were both down more than 7%, while EV maker Tesla (TSLA) tumbled nearly 10%,
