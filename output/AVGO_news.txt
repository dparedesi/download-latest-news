ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) is set to announce its earnings on Thursday, September 4, 2025. Historical records indicate that purchasing AVGO stock prior to the earnings announcement has often been a successful strategy. In the past five years, the stock has recorded positive one-day returns 75% of the time, with a median increase of 3.0% and a peak single-day return of 24.4%. For traders focused on specific events, having a strong grasp of historical trends can be beneficial, although the results are largely contingent on how the company’s outcomes measure up to market anticipations. Two separate strategies may be employed for events of this nature: Consensus forecasts for the upcoming report predict earnings of $1.66 per share on revenues of $15.82 billion. This indicates significant growth from the same quarter last year, which reported earnings of $1.24 per share and revenues of $13.07 billion. From a fundamental perspective, Broadcom has a market capitalization of $1.4 trillion. The company has showcased robust financial results over the past year, achieving $57 billion in revenue, $21 billion in operating profits, and $13 billion in net income. That said, if you're looking for potential upside with reduced volatility compared to holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has significantly outperformed its benchmark—a blend of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception.

See earnings reaction history of all stocks Here are some insights on one-day (1D) post-earnings returns: Additional data on the observed 5-Day (5D) and 21-Day (21D) returns after earnings are summarized alongside the statistics in the table below. A less risky strategy (although not useful if the correlation is weak) is to understand the correlation between short-term and medium-term returns following earnings, identify a pair that has the strongest correlation, and execute the necessary trade. For instance, if 1D and 5D exhibit the highest correlation, a trader may position themselves "long" for the subsequent 5 days if the 1D post-earnings return is positive. Below is some correlation data based on a 5-year and a 3-year (more recent) history. Please note that the correlation 1D_5D refers to the relationship between 1D post-earnings returns and the following 5D returns. Also, see – Buy or Fear AVGO Stock? Occasionally, the performance of peers can impact the stock reaction following earnings. In fact, the pricing may begin even before the earnings are revealed. Below is some historical data on the past post-earnings performance of Broadcom stock in comparison to the stock performance of peers that announced earnings just before Broadcom. For a fair comparison, peer stock returns are also represented as post-earnings one-day (1D) returns. Discover more about Trefis RV strategy which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combining all three indexes: the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000), yielding strong returns for investors. Additionally, if you desire upside with a steadier experience compared to an individual stock like Broadcom, explore the High Quality portfolio, which has outpaced the S&P and achieved >91% returns since it began.

Title: NVIDIA & Magnificent 7: Too Hot To Handle?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2025/08/31/nvidia--magnificent-7-too-hot-to-handle/

ByBill Stone, Contributor. As the dominant supplier of artificial intelligence (AI) chips, NVIDIA (NVDA) has become the largest company in the world and within the S&P 500 index. Following NVIDIA’s earnings last week, it’s an appropriate time to revisit the attractiveness of large technology stocks with a special emphasis on NVIDIA. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), collectively account for nearly 34% of the S&P 500’s market capitalization. Eight of the ten largest companies in the S&P 500 are technology companies, including Broadcom (AVGO). Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) are the only non-technology companies in the top ten. Investors already appreciate the strong fundamentals of the Magnificent 7, and NVIDIA in particular, with stock returns far outstripping those of the S&P 500. The Magnificent 7 and NVIDIA have achieved total returns of 280% and 1,093%, respectively, since the start of the ChatGPT era at the end of 2022, while the S&P 500 has returned 75%. Based on the past twelve months of earnings and consensus earnings estimates for the next twelve months, the price-to-earnings ratios for all the Magnificent 7 stocks are above the S&P 500. While this ratio indicates that most of these companies have a higher valuation on both measures, it doesn’t answer whether other factors justify that premium. Another way to value companies is by their multiple revenues, which is called the price-to-sales ratio. All the Magnificent 7 are valued at price-to-sales ratios above the S&P 500, with NVIDIA at an almost twenty-seven times price-to-sales ratio. Historical annualized growth in sales over the last three and five years has been impressive for most of the group, but downright amazing for NVIDIA. Likewise, historical earnings per share growth has generally been impressive and exceptional, as seen in cases like NVIDIA. The five-year annualized earnings per share growth rate of the Magnificent 7 demonstrates just how unique these companies have been when compared to the stock market as a whole. Future earnings are the most crucial criterion when considering whether to buy or hold a stock. Consensus forecasts from Wall Street analysts still evidence significant optimism about NVIDIA’s earnings growth prospects, with 39% annualized growth expected from the world’s largest company. Separately, the sustainable growth rate for the group supports the future growth story. The sustainable growth rate theoretically indicates how fast a company can grow without borrowing additional funds while maintaining its existing capital structure. The profitability metrics of most of the Magnificent 7 are impressive. Gross margins represent the profitability after all direct expenses, specifically the cost of goods sold, have been deducted from sales. Operating margins measure how much a company earns on a dollar of sales after paying for the variable expenses, or the percentage of sales converted into operating income. NVIDIA converted almost seventy cents of every sales dollar into operating profit over the last year. While NVIDIA’s gross margin was about 70% over the previous year, it improved to 75% in the most recent quarter. Just looking at a simple high price-to-earnings ratio can be deceiving when analyzing a company with high returns on invested capital (ROIC). It is crucial to consider the return generated on the capital needed to fund a business, since a company with a sustainably higher ROIC should sell at a valuation premium. To put some of the impressive return on invested capital figures for the Magnificent 7 into proper perspective, the ROIC for the S&P 500 is around 8%. Furthermore, most companies in the Magnificent 7 generate substantial amounts of free cash flow, despite investing in growing businesses. The free cash flow margin indicates the percentage of revenue that the company can utilize or distribute to shareholders as free cash flow. NVIDIA is exceptional, with almost forty-four cents of every dollar in sales converted to free cash flow. The free cash flow yield refers to the free cash flow per share generated by a business, expressed as a percentage of its stock price. Value investors, such as Warren Buffett, value a company based on the cash that can be distributed from a business over its lifetime, discounted back to the present. Free cash flow can be a good measure of the money available to owners. A free cash flow yield below that of the S&P 500, such as the Magnificent 7 and NVIDIA, can be seen as investors already pricing in superior growth and durability of free cash flow relative to the market. NVIDIA is particularly notable given the massive increase in its market capitalization, which now exceeds $4.2 trillion, driven by the artificial intelligence spending wave. The consumer introduction of ChatGPT as an artificial intelligence tool in late 2022 coincided with a sharp rise in NVIDIA’s valuation, as the company became the dominant supplier of AI semiconductors. There has been some concern about NVIDIA’s relatively meager beat of consensus earnings estimates last week and less exceptional guidance than has been typical. There were zero sales to China in the quarter due to geopolitical tensions, which made for more challenging comparisons. For example, data center sales, which were impacted by China, declined by 1% quarter-over-quarter, but were up about 12% quarter-over-quarter excluding China, according to TD Cowen. Despite NVIDIA’s less optimistic forward guidance than was hoped, a resumption in sales to China could add $2 to $5 billion in sales. In the short term, NVIDIA’s dominance in high-end artificial intelligence computing appears untouchable, as its next-generation platform is on pace for meaningful production next year. Furthermore, the company continues to benefit from AI demand outstripping supply, alleviating concerns about potential pricing pressures. It appears likely that AI will be a transformative tool for businesses and households, generating substantial economic benefits. Although it is still early, indications suggest that artificial intelligence adoption is continuing at a brisk pace. The capital spending (capex) by AI-leaders, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft, to support complex computations needed to support AI, has seen a massive rise since 2023. NVIDIA reaped significant revenue from this spending as the leading chip provider for AI. Estimates are that capital spending by these four AI leaders will exceed $400 billion by 2026. What if demand for AI services doesn’t meet expectations or the firms are unable to monetize the services at a profitable enough level? Capital expenditures (capex) budgets can indeed be slashed if needed. This downside risk isn’t a forecast, but it must be considered when evaluating NVIDIA and all AI-connected technology stocks. Notably, these sizable capital expenditures are more sustainable than some past instances, because the companies are highly profitable and can self-fund rather than depending on the charity of lenders or additional capital. Though it is nowhere in sight, one must always be wary of some competing technology eventually displacing NVIDIA as a dominant leader. Capitalism subjects companies to intense competition in their pursuit of profits, and the profits generated by technology leaders make them an attractive target. The bullish case for large tech and NVIDIA is bolstered by the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). The mega-cap technology stocks, represented by the Magnificent 7, continue to produce earnings and free cash flow at impressive rates. Large technology stocks typically exhibit exceptional profitability compared to the average stock and should therefore trade at a premium valuation. The rise in the stock prices of the Magnificent 7, including NVIDIA, has been supported by robust fundamentals and not just a promise of future profitability. Investors buy or hold companies for their future profits, not their past performance. The past is only significant to the extent that it informs the firm’s future prospects. While one needs to remain mindful of risk, the robust adoption rate of artificial intelligence, combined with companies’ ability to self-fund the massive costs required to build AI infrastructure, implies that the end is not yet here. Investors should be mindful of the risk associated with concentrated holdings, given the remarkable growth of some of these technology leaders.

Title: Nvidia, Broadcom Lead Chip Stocks Lower Amid China Concerns to End a Strong Month

The chips are down to close out August. A range of chip stocks slid Friday, weighing on the major U.S. equities indexes in the last trading session of the month. China concerns weighed on the sector, but that wasn't the only factor that pulled shares lower. The tech sector led losses on the S&P 500 Friday, with Nvidia (NVDA) among its biggest decliners. The giant's shares lost over 3% amid uncertainty about its China sales after it reported quarterly results Wednesday. Broadcom (AVGO), which reports next week, saw its stock fall close to 4%. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and other chip stocks were also lower, with the PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX) down roughly 3%. Marvell Technology (MRVL) shares plunged the most of any stock in the sector index, losing nearly a fifth of its value after the firm posted an outlook that missed analysts' estimates, with concerns about U.S. restrictions on chip sales to China and Marvell's large exposure to the country adding to worries. The Trump administration said Friday that it’s eliminating a Biden-era loophole allowing Samsung and SK Hynix subsidiaries in China to import American chipmaking equipment and software without a license, which could make it more difficult for the companies to upgrade plants and affect supply chains for other chip firms that rely on their manufacturing services. The rule is set to take effect in January. “The Trump Administration is committed to closing export control loopholes—particularly those that put U.S. companies at a competitive disadvantage. Today’s decision is an important step towards fulfilling this commitment," Under Secretary of Commerce Jeffrey Kessler said. Samsung and SK Hynix, which both make chips for Nvidia and Broadcom, did not immediately respond to Investopedia's request for comment. Intel (INTC), which completed the sale of its facility in Dalian, China to SK Hynix earlier this year, was also named in Friday’s notice. Meanwhile, Alibaba Group's (BABA) cloud computing unit reportedly developed a new chip more advanced than its legacy products that could help fill the void left by Nvidia's H20 AI chip that has yet to resume sales in China. Shares of Alibaba, also bolstered by its latest quarterly results, surged 13%. August has been a strong month for most chipmakers, with the PHLX Semiconductor Index set to post gains for August on optimism about AI-driven growth, which helped buoy the S&P 500 to a record high yesterday.
