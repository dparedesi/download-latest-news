Investing.com -- As the second week of December ended, several stocks experienced significant volatility, mostly as a reaction to their earnings results. Out of many, here are Investing.com’s stocks of the week: Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) experienced a sharp decline after reporting disappointing guidance on Thursday, leading several analysts, including those from RBC Capital, Mizuho (NYSE:MFG), Piper Sandler, and Oppenheimer, to lower their price targets to a range of $590–$620. RBC Capital cut its price target to $590 from $610, citing reduced estimates but maintained an Outperform rating. The firm noted that Adobe’s quarterly results were solid, with record DM net-new ARR, although the upside was smaller compared to recent quarters. "ADBE has been a frustrating stock for much of FY24. Having said that, we remain confident ADBE will significantly monetize its Generative AI innovations going forward, and we expect healthy upside to the FY25 ARR/revenue guidance as the year unfolds.," an analyst at Mizuho said. On Friday, Adobe’s stock continued to decline, trading about 2% lower at $465. Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock saw positive reaction after its earnings, buoyed by upbeat guidance and surging AI revenues. The company hit a trillion-dollar valuation on Friday and shares climbed over 24%. Cantor Fitzgerald reaffirmed its Overweight rating and a $250 price target for the stock. “We see the strength in AI continuing at a rapid pace for AVGO, and the company has laid out a SAM of $60B–$90B with its three AI customers that it currently does business with,” an analyst at Piper Sandler noted. This week, Warner Bros Discovery Inc (NASDAQ:WBD) announced its new corporate structure, under which Warner Bros. Discovery will serve as the parent company for two distinct operating divisions - Global Linear Networks and Streaming & Studios. "We continue to prioritize ensuring our Global Linear Networks business is well positioned to continue to drive free cash flow, while our Streaming & Studios business focuses on driving growth by telling the world’s most compelling stories," according to the firm's President and CEO, David Zaslav. The company expects to complete the implementation of the new corporate structure by mid-2025. The new structure is expected to give it more flexibility. Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google kicked off the week by unveiling a new chip called Willow, which demonstrates advanced error correction and performance capabilities, paving the way for a functional, large-scale quantum computer. The tech giant also unveiled Gemini 2.0, its latest AI model, which Google claims is its most advanced yet. Even though shares rose during the week following these announcements, Alphabet shares ended the week down by 1.11%. Separately, The Information reported on Thursday that Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai was expected to meet with President-elect Donald Trump.

Title: Broadcom's AI Chip Leadership Puts Pressure on Nvidia and Marvell, Analysts Say

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock surged Friday after it reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter adjusted EPS results and raised its quarterly common stock dividend. The company reported a topline of $14.05 billion, up from $9.3 billion, compared to the analyst estimate of $14.57 billion. EPS of $1.42 missed the analyst consensus of $1.46. Also Read: T-Mobile’s Premium Valuation Prompts Downgrade As Growth Projections Decelerate: Analyst Broadcom expects first-quarter revenue of ~$14.60 billion, almost in line with the $14.61 billion consensus estimate. Multiple Wall Street analysts rerated the stock after the print: Rosenblatt analyst Hans Mosesmann maintained Broadcom with a Buy and raised the price target from $240 to $250. B of A Securities analyst Vivek Arya reiterated Broadcom with a Buy and raised the price target from $215 to $250. JP Morgan analyst Harlan Sur maintained Broadcom with an Overweight and raised the price target from $210 to $250. Rosenblatt: Broadcom came in with a slight beat on continued AI and networking momentum and some VMWare first-quarter pushouts. Non-AI dynamics continue to demonstrate modest cyclical recovery. The Street will pivot on management’s disclosure of the line-of-sight AI serviceable available market (SAM) at its current custom ASIC (XPU) 3 hyperscaler customers of $60 billion—$90 billion by 2027, up from the $15 billion—$20 billion level in 2024. Interestingly, Broadcom has two new potential engagements that could eventually match the size of the current three. The AI 3-year outlook supports the ~60% CAGR of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMD) TAM of $500 billion for the 2027 and 2028 timeframes. Management implied strong prospects for maintaining AI custom ASIC leadership and share gains over Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) GPUs. Broadcom already has working custom ASIC 3nm silicon that will ship this Spring, well ahead of anybody in the market. While custom ASIC sister Marvell Technology, Inc (NASDAQ:MRVL) is also in the 3nm race, it is roughly a year behind Broadcom. Mosesmann’s fiscal 2025 revenue and adjusted EPS estimates remain unchanged. B of A Securities: The rerating reflects Broadcom’s expanding custom-chip (ASIC) AI, surging AI opportunity, and potential to maintain a position at large wireless customer Apple. Near-term results were inline, though the pushout of some software deals from the fourth to the first quarter helped Broadcom guide the first quarter inline versus concerns of missing due to seasonal headwinds, the analyst said. Arya projected fiscal 2025 revenue of $61.1 billion (prior $59.3 billion) and EPS of $6.27 (prior $6.00). He expects fiscal 2026 revenue of $70.2 billion (prior $68.5 billion) and EPS of $7.50 (prior $7.31). His forecast implies a growth trajectory of about 15% sales and 20% EPS over the next three years across a diversified silicon and infrastructure software base. Based on Broadcom’s leading capabilities and IP in leading-edge logic, networking, memory, and interface design, Arya projected its AI sales to grow from $12 billion in the current year to about $30 billion by calendar 2027. However, Arya noted an upside to a 30% EPS CAGR towards $11-$12/share by calendar 2027, assuming AI sales get to $53 billion instead, based on Broadcom maintaining its current 70% share of a larger $75 billion SAM. There could be further upside since, per Broadcom, the stated range is only for its current three customer’s “line-of-sight” intention to each build 1 million unit custom accelerator (XPU) clusters requiring an 80% and 20% mix of compute and networking. JP Morgan: Broadcom delivered solid fourth-quarter quarterly results on continued strong sequential growth in its AI semiconductor segment, which offset lower software revenues. For the first quarter, Broadcom guided revenues in line with consensus expectations and better than market expectations on sustained strong AI demand and software revenue acceleration. The fiscal 2024 AI revenues were $12.2 billion, up 3 times year-on-year. Sur expects them to grow to $17 billion-$18 billion (+40% Y/Y) in fiscal 2025, given continued strong cloud and hyperscaler capex spending trends with a focus on AI infrastructure build-out and second-half ramp of Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google’s next-gen TPU v6 3nm AI accelerator ASIC. More importantly, Broadcom expects the AI SAM opportunity for its three existing cloud/hyperscalers to accelerate, driven by continued substantial investments in multi-generational XPU road maps and larger cluster sizes. Even applying a more conservative market share assumption, Sur noted that Broadcom’s AI business is growing at a 40%- 50%+ revenue CAGR over the next several years. In the near term, despite a product handoff from the TPU v6 inference chip at 5nm to the TPU v6 training chip at 3nm, Broadcom is still guiding for sequential growth in its AI revenues for the first quarter. The TPU v6 3nm training chip will likely move into a high volume ramp in the second half of next fiscal year, and this one SKU Sur noted can drive $8 billion+ for Broadcom in fiscal 2025. Given its portfolio breadth, diversification, and product cycles, Broadcom continues to drive a stable revenue growth profile even during macro volatility. Broadcom generated strong free cash flow for the year, which resulted in an 11% dividend increase. Sur projected fiscal 2025 revenue of $62.7 billion and EPS of $6.50. Price Action: AVGO stock is up 19.7% at $216.20 at last check Friday.

Broadcom (AVGO-4.91%) has surpassed the $1 trillion market cap for the first time after it reported a 220% jump in artificial intelligence revenue. The chipmaker’s shares were up by about 20% during Friday morning trading, pushing its market cap to $1.02 trillion. Broadcom stock is up by about 10o% so far this year. The San Jose-based company reported revenues of $14.05 billion for the fourth quarter ended in November — a 51% increase from the previous year. Net income was $4.32 billion — a 23% year-over-year increase. Meanwhile, revenue in Broadcom’s semiconductor solutions group, which develops its AI chips, rose 12% from the same quarter last year to $8.23 billion. “Semiconductor revenue was a record $30.1 billion driven by AI revenue of $12.2 billion,” Broadcom CEO Hock Tan said in a statement. “AI revenue which grew 220 percent year-on-year was driven by our leading AI XPUs and Ethernet networking portfolio.” On the company’s earnings call, Tan said Broadcom sees “our opportunity over the next three years in AI as massive.” He added that “specific hyperscalers have begun their respective journeys to develop their own custom AI accelerators.” Tan said Broadcom is developing AI chips, which it refers to as XPUs, with three of its hyper-scale customers, and that the company expects each customer to deploy one million AI chips in networked clusters by 2027. This could lead the total market opportunity for its XPUs and other AI networking to be between $60 billion and $90 billion in fiscal year 2027, Tan said. Broadcom set revenue guidance at $14.6 billion for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025. Earlier this week, The Information reported that iPhone maker Apple (AAPL+0.93%) is developing its first AI chip, internally known as Baltra, with Broadcom. The AI chip could reportedly start mass production by 2026. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Broadcom (AVGO) shares surged in extended trading Thursday after the chipmaker reported better-than-expected earnings and issued a rosy outlook amid robust AI-driven sales growth. The company said its fiscal 2024 AI revenue more than tripled, driven by its AI XPUs and Ethernet networking portfolio. After-hours gains accelerated after CEO Hock Tan told analysts on the company’s earnings call that he anticipates significant AI opportunities over the next three years, adding that he sees accelerators and networking sales in fiscal 2027 ranging between $60 billion and $90 billion. Through Thursday's close, Broadcom shares had gained 64% since the start of the year. The stock rose 14% to around $206 in extended trading. Below, we break down the technicals on Broadcom’s weekly chart and identify key price levels worth watching out for. Broadcom shares have consolidated within an ascending triangle since mid June, a chart pattern that signals a continuation of the stock’s longer-term uptrend. Indeed, the price sits poised to break out above the formation’s top trendline on Friday, setting the stage for further upside. Moreover, the relative strength index (RSI) gives a reading just above 50, confirming bullish momentum and indicating the shares have ample room to test higher prices as they move into price discovery. Let’s apply technical analysis to forecast a potential upside price target and also identify two key support levels that would likely attract buying interest during retracements. To forecast an upside target in the stock, investors can use the bars pattern tool, which analyzes prior trends to help predict future directional moves. When applying the tool to Broadcom's chart, we extract the stock’s trend higher from December 2023 to June this year and reposition it from the ascending triangle’s top trendline. This projects a longer-term upside target of around $315. We selected this prior move as it commenced following a decisive earnings-driven jump above a continuation pattern on the chart in December last year, similar price action to what looks likely after the company’s latest quarterly report. During pullbacks, investors should initially watch how the price reacts to the $185 level. This location on the chart would likely attract buying interest near the ascending triangle’s top trendline, which may flip from an area of prior resistance into future support. Selling below this level could see Broadcom shares revisit lower support around $140, an area where investors may seek buying opportunities near a horizontal line that connects a series of comparable trading activity on the chart between February and September.
