We recently published a list of Jim Cramer’s Latest Mad Money Episode: Top 10 Stocks to Watch. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other stocks on Jim Cramer's top stocks to watch list. Jim Cramer in a latest program on CNBC made the case for investing in individual stocks to enjoy bigger gains when compared to investing in just the broader market index funds. Cramer said that while it's "easy" to just park your money in index funds and let the market do the work, investing in individual stocks can give you some "serious gains." "I think you should own more than just an index fund because buying individual stocks with special characteristics is how you can rack up some really serious gains. That includes often scoring speculative stocks. Far too often, we become snobs when we talk stocks. So many experts think that if you venture past the index, you could fall off some sort of intellectual cliff that makes any gains null and void. It’s as if the huge swath of points you could have gained simply don’t count. But that, people, is nonsense." Cramer said banks do not "care" where the money comes from and neither should investors. He urged investors to not always avoid speculation. "I come tonight to praise speculation. Here, I’m the only one on TV who actually does this, believe it or not, and to show you how well you could have done if you picked some high flyers for your portfolio and simply held them for the long ride, along with your prosaic, precious index funds."

Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 130 Commenting about Broadcom in a latest program on CNBC, Jim Cramer said: “I am also pulling for Broadcom. I think Broadcom should do well. I don’t know whether Cisco is going to hurt it today with its light guidance because I think Broadcom is doing very very well.” Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) continues to be a leader in the AI ASCI and networking chips market. Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) has 3nm AI ASIC chip deals with Alphabet and Meta in addition to many other tech giants aiming massive spending for AI hyperscaling. The company’s Ethernet business is also strong amid partnerships with Arista Networks (ANET), while the company is also collaborating with Dell (DELL), Juniper (JNPR), and Super Micro (SMCI) in the networking business and other segments. Baron Opportunity Fund stated the following regarding Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “We continued to build our position in Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), a global technology leader that designs, develops, and supplies a broad range of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions. As AI continues to proliferate, we believe hyperscalers – such as Meta, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Compute, and Amazon Web Services, to name just a few – will increasingly deploy custom accelerator chips for their AI workloads as they can be more cost-effective and energy-efficient than using NVIDIA’s general-purpose GPUs. Broadcom has a leading position partnering with hyperscalers to develop these custom chips, with its AI customer accelerator business up 3.5-times year-over-year in its most recently reported quarter, and a goal of at least $8 billion in custom accelerator revenues for this fiscal year. Additionally, VMware continues to perform better than expected as Broadcom is implementing its product simplification and subscription revenue model strategy. Further, its non-AI related semiconductor business, which tends to be more cyclical, is in the early stages of a recovery. Combined, all these factors will drive strong revenue and earnings growth over the next several years.” Overall, AVGO ranks 3rd on our list of Jim Cramer's top stocks to watch. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO, our conviction lies in the belief that under-the-radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Barclays Highlights Key Semiconductor Trends Including Nvidia Blackwell Ramp and Apple iPhone Cuts

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Barclays analysts gave a review of the chip industry and talked about Nvidia's (NVDA, Financials) Blackwell ramp, Apple's (AAPL, Financials) plans to cut iPhone production, and wider market trends, after undertaking a trip to Asia. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with NVDA. According to analyst Tom O'Malley, now roughly 50% of Nvidia's Blackwell ramp is used, and over the next few quarters it is expected to rise to 80%. With this degree of use, Nvidia's income in the January quarter may be about $6 billion. By April, the company's manufacturing capability is planned to double to 40,000 wafers monthly. By contrast, during the third quarter its Hopper products reached 600,000 units monthly manufacturing volume. Although Blackwell-Ultra solutions are not yet included into the supply chain, O'Malley pointed out that they should increase with the launch of single-die solutions early next year. While manufacture of the TPU v5 chips is likely to stall between January and April, resulting in a brief drop in numbers before a major rise in July, Google's (GOOG, Financials) TPU v6 chips are scheduled to join the supply chain by late Q2 2025. Manufacturers of application-specific integrated circuits are aiming for the 3-nanometer node in 2026 in advanced chip fabrication. O'Malley said, nevertheless, that businesses like Broadcom (AVGO, Financials) and Marvell (MRVL, Financials) are not expected to lose market share. While AMD's (AMD, Financials) AI accelerator productsthe MI300 and 325saw a rise in orders in the fourth quarter but are likely to show a sequential drop in the first quarter of 2025. Early data for AMD's Xilinx subsidiary shows double-digit year-over-year growth, but momentum may slow early next year. Premium flagship Android smartphones are doing very well in the smartphone market, which helps Qualcomm (QCOM, Financials). Although Qualcomm is also gaining from aggressive pricing in the low-end market, the company's Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 chip has proven success in fetching premium price. O'Malley also said that as Samsung Electronics (SSNLF, Financials) struggles with its own 3-nanometer ramp, Qualcomm is probably securing 100% of the Samsung Galaxy S25 CPU supply. Mid-tier smartphone weakness is predicted to affect vendors like Skyworks Solutions (SWKS, Financials) and Qorvo (QRVO, Financials). O'Malley noted conflicting indications about Apple iPhone manufacturing, with recent figures indicating a possible 10% to 15% drop in unit output for the March quarter. Featuring an Apple modem, the iPhone SE is scheduled for a late Q1 release and volumes are estimated to reach 25 million devices. O'Malley said in the memory industry that although NAND demand is still sluggish, demand for DRAM is promising; mid-to-high teens increase projected in 2025. While demand for high-bandwidth memory is surpassing previous estimates, supply limitations might help to stabilize costs. O'Malley predicts that capital expenditures for 2025 will stay flat; Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM, Financials) is focusing on moving manufacturing nodes from N5 to N3. Samsung's capacity to scale is being limited by its difficulties with 3-nanometer yields as well. With less development than expected by market forecasts, Barclays anticipates wafer fab equipment investment to reflect these constraints. Based on Barclays' research, the semiconductor sector shows mixed development possibilities with variances across businesses and sectors. This article first appeared on GuruFocus.
