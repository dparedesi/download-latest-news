Title: 5 High Yield CEFs With Steep Discounts Right Now
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettowens/2025/10/12/5-high-yield-cefs-with-steep-discounts-right-now/
Time Published: 2025-10-12T14:00:00Z
Full Content:
ByBrett Owens, Contributor. Closed-end funds (CEFs) are the last bargains left on the board. CEFs are often confused with mutual funds and ETFs, but they are different because they often trade at discounts to their net asset values (NAVs). For contrarians like us looking for deals, this is key. CEF trading is relatively thin. This created inefficiencies, such as select CEFs trading for as cheap as 95 or even 90 cents on the dollar. Plus, some of them dish big dividends—like these five. Let’s start with the Eaton Vance Tax-Advantaged Dividend Income Fund (EVT)—a CEF that buys not just common stocks, but also preferred stocks, that distribute qualified dividends. Qualified dividends are taxed at the more favorable long-term capital gains tax rates; non-qualified dividends, like those paid by most real estate investment trusts (REITs), face less favorable short-term capital gains rates. EVT’s four managers currently hold an 80/20 blend of common and preferred stocks, with the traditional equity “sleeve” made up of about 80 predominantly large-cap stocks. Names like JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Abbott Laboratories (ABT) and NextEra Energy (NEE) would be right at home in a bog-standard dividend fund. But while that fund would likely pay 2% or so, EVT delivers 4x that number, at 8% currently. (And it’s a monthly dividend payer, no less.) Part of that high yield we can chalk up to leverage—management borrows additional funds to invest even more money in their picks, which amplifies yields and gains if we’re fortunate, and amplifies losses if we’re not. Leverage currently sits at about 20% of assets. But the other part of it is the nature of those distributions. When Eaton Vance’s fund sends out a monthly distribution, dividend income is only a (small) portion of that. The rest is capital gains, usually of the long-term variety. It’s a “managed” distribution, too—the typical dividend fund’s income will vary from one period to the next, but EVT’s monthly payout hasn’t changed since April 2024, when the CEF raised its distribution by about 11%. The strategy doesn’t give us much of an edge over basic dividend funds, however—at least not longer-term. Right now, valuation is on EVT’s side, as the fund trades at a roughly 8% discount to NAV that’s wider than its longer-term 5% average. Options strategies are popular in CEFLand. Sometimes they’re complementary to the primary strategy, but sometimes they’re the whole point. The latter is the case with the Eaton Vance Tax-Managed Buy-Write Opportunities (ETV). It holds a portfolio of 150, mostly large-cap stocks like Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL), then sells covered calls on a few major market indexes like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite to generate income, which it distributes to its shareholders monthly. Funds that sell covered calls—especially those where the strategy revolves around it—are designed to limit downside and provide income. On that front, actively managed covered-call strategies like ETV are better than comparable plain-vanilla index ETFs. Better still? We can sometimes buy that protection on the cheap; while ETV tends to trade on par with its NAV, we can buy the fund and its monthly distributions at 94 cents on the dollar. BlackRock Enhanced Global Dividend Trust (BOE) is like a mix of ETV and EVT, with global exposure (read: U.S. and international stocks) mixed in. Management has built a roughly 50-stock portfolio that’s currently split 65/35 across U.S. and international stocks, but that blend can and will change over time. When I’ve looked at this fund in past years, I’ve seen it hold as much as half of assets in international stocks, which is higher than the typical global fund. But like ETV and EVT, everything revolves around blue chips. It holds U.S. mega-caps like Microsoft and Broadcom (AVGO), but also developed-market names like AstraZeneca (AZN) and even emerging-market giants like Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) and Alibaba (BABA). International stocks might pay more than domestics, but BOE still yields roughly 3x more than most global ETFs. It’s not leverage, which is vanishingly thin, but a covered call strategy—one that helps fund a monthly distribution north of 8%. We’re not expecting to outperform a basic index over time, but we do expect less volatility and smaller drawdowns. An 8.7% discount to NAV would seem to give us an edge right now, but it’s a shallower markdown than its longer-term 11% average. Many sector ETFs and mutual funds are usually faithful to one slice of the market. We buy technology funds for technology stocks, and bank funds for bank stocks. But CEFs like the BlackRock Resources & Commodities Strategy Trust (BCX) aren’t afraid to “cross the streams.” BCX primarily invests in stocks “issued by commodity or natural resources companies,” meaning that the portfolio straddles the energy and materials sectors. The management team has assembled a tight portfolio of just 45 companies including integrated energy majors like Shell (SHEL) and Exxon Mobil (XOM), but also metals and minerals specialists like Wheaton Precious Metals (WPM) and Freeport McMoRan (FCX). The fund also may invest in derivatives, and it also sells covered calls to enhance its dividend yield. The result? It’s not always that way. Longer-term, BCX has struggled to capture some of the biggest moves in metals, at least in part because of its covered-call strategy. Like with many CEFs, the best chance for success is buying while the fund is cheap. We can currently buy BlackRock’s fund for a 6% discount, but it’s not really a deal compared to its long-term average discount of 10%. We get a more targeted energy play (and the highest yield of the bunch, at nearly 10%) from the ClearBridge Energy Midstream Opportunity Fund (EMO). Co-Managers Peter Vanderlee and Patrick McElroy own just 20 companies. But it’s a who’s who of midstream companies (firms that operate pipelines, storage, terminals and other energy assets), including regular stocks such as Targa Resources (TRGP) and ONEOK (OKE), as well as master limited partnerships (MLPs) such as Energy Transfer LP (ET) and Enterprise Products Partners LP (EPD). Unlike with the other CEFs mentioned above, EMO’s holdings do a lot of the talking as it pertains to the monthly distribution. MLPs are among some of the highest-yielding securities in the stock market. But the fund still pays more than most MLP ETFs thanks to high leverage of nearly 30%. EMO trails its benchmark, the Alerian MLP Index—represented in the chart below by the Alerian MLP ETF (AMLP)—by 30 percentage points since inception in 2011. But since 2023 EMO has nearly doubled the return of AMLP, thanks to its aggressive leverage. EMO has the deepest discount on this list—we currently can buy shares at 91 cents on the dollar. But thanks to its hot performance, it’s actually expensive in historical terms, trading well above its longer-term 15% average discount.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. From a quantitative perspective, the 90.4% change in Broadcom (AVGO) stock from 4/12/2025 to 10/9/2025 was mainly driven by a 71.0% change in the company's Net Income Margin (%). There’s more to this story than simply numbers, so let's first break down the stock price movements into their contributing factors. That's one perspective on stocks. Trefis High Quality Portfolio assesses much more and is crafted to minimize stock-specific risk while offering upside potential. Returning to the “change”: The alteration in fundamental factors such as valuation, revenue, and margins has a background story concerning the business and investor sentiment. Below, we have pinpointed critical developments that affected stock price movement for AVGO stock. As a brief background: AVGO offers semiconductor devices and infrastructure software, which includes set-top box system-on-chips, cable, DSL, and passive optical networking solutions. Opinion: We currently find AVGO stock appealing yet volatile. Why is that? Take a look at the complete story. Read Buy or Sell AVGO Stock to understand what informs our current viewpoint. Risk: However, AVGO is not insulated from significant decreases. It declined nearly 48% during the Covid pandemic, approximately 35% in the 2021 inflation shock, and around 27% during the 2018 correction. Even with solid fundamentals, it's evident that the stock can experience significant drops when the market turns. Strong companies still endure difficulties when sentiment shifts dramatically. Consistently selecting winners is a challenging endeavor - particularly due to the volatility associated with individual stocks. Instead, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which comprises 30 stocks, has a history of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the past 4-year period. What accounts for this? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered better returns with reduced risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster experience, as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: AMD, Marvell, Intel: Which Is The Next Multi-Trillion Chip Stock
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/09/amd-marvell-intel-which-is-the-next-multi-trillion-chip-stock/

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. On Monday, AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) made news by entering into a significant agreement with OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT, to provide tens of thousands of its GPU chips for 6 gigawatts of computing power over the forthcoming five years. The initial gigawatt comprising AMD’s next-generation Instinct MI450 chips will be delivered in the latter half of 2026. This contract signifies one of the largest individual chip acquisitions ever made in the AI industry and highlights OpenAI's efforts to diversify its hardware supply chain beyond the industry leader Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which commands over 75% of the AI computing market. This strategic shift could represent a pivotal moment, not only for AMD but also for the ongoing expansion of the AI computing sector, opening avenues for emerging leaders in the AI semiconductor arena. The next phase of the AI computing race will no longer be about just training large language models – it’s increasingly about inference, or putting AI to work in the real world. Training is akin to teaching an AI model everything they know, while inference is when that knowledge is applied – answering questions, generating text, or running chatbots millions of times a day. As AI applications scale to hundreds of millions of users, the demand for inference capacity is set to explode. Running these workloads efficiently has become the new bottleneck, forcing companies to rethink how and where they deploy compute. Nvidia has dominated training with its H100 and A100 GPUs, but inference could shift the equation. Once models are trained, they must run continuously across billions of devices, making energy efficiency, latency, and hardware availability crucial factors. Nvidia Stock 2x To $350? That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock like NVDA, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. As AI matures, more of the value creation could shift from training toward inference. Morgan Stanley projects roughly $3 trillion will be invested into the AI build out over the next three years – and it is likely that a significant portion will flow toward inference. To put this in perspective: Nvidia’s market cap is currently around $4.5 trillion, fueled largely by its dominance in training. But inference could actually be the bigger market. In the coming years, inference could easily surpass training in total revenue and total GPU units shipped, opening a new frontier in the AI chip race. This could favor companies that offer cheaper, more energy-efficient, and readily available chips, not just the most powerful ones. This shift opens the field to a broader range of players. So who are the potential winners here? Nvidia is likely to remain a leading player even as the AI market shifts. The company’s deeply entrenched software ecosystem – including CUDA, TensorRT, and cuDNN – are likely to have locked in many early customers. It is also adapting its product line, focusing on powerful new chip architectures for inference and optimized inference software to meet growing workloads from video generation to large-scale real-time AI applications. Combined with its strong partnerships across hyperscalers, AI startups, and enterprise customers, the company is likely to remain an AI leader, although it’s very likely that its share of the AI compute market will trend lower. AMD has considerably lagged Nvidia in the early stage of the AI build out, but it could emerge as a key challenger to Nvidia in inference. The OpenAI partnership further validates AMD’s position as a serious inference player and signals that the company is steadily carving out a place as a preferred provider for scalable, efficient AI compute solutions. AMD chips are increasingly competitive in performance while offering cost and memory advantages. Not all organizations need or can afford Nvidia’s top-tier GPUs. Many are likely to opt for older Nvidia chips or cost-effective alternatives like AMD’s MI series, which offer solid performance for inference and fine-tuning of models. Intel might seem like a wildcard in the AI chip race, but it has a credible shot at the inference market. Its broad portfolio – including CPUs, Gaudi Habana accelerators, and an extensive datacenter ecosystem – positions Intel to deliver energy-efficient, high-volume inference solutions. Intel’s fabs could benefit as AI inference drives demand for high volumes of lower- to mid-tier chips, which Intel may be more well-positioned to produce for other companies. While its Intel’s process technology lags the likes of TSMC at the cutting edge for top-tier GPUs, it is probably more than capable of fabricating efficient, cost-effective inference chips. See: OpenAI’s Next Bet: Intel Stock? ASIC, or Application-Specific Integrated Circuits, are increasingly gaining attention in the AI space. Unlike versatile, general-purpose GPUs, ASICs are engineered for a single task, making them far more cost- and energy-efficient for large-scale inference workloads. The crypto industry offers a clear precedent: Bitcoin mining initially relied on GPUs, but rapidly shifted to ASICs once scale and efficiency became paramount. related How Marvell Stock Surges To $140 A similar evolution could play out in AI inference. Two companies positioned to capitalize on this trend are Marvell, which has a market capitalization of roughly $1.5 trillion, and Broadcom, both with proven expertise in designing custom silicon for hyperscalers. Broadcom, in particular, has emerged as a standout, securing a $10 billion deal with OpenAI. Up 500%, What’s Happening With AVGO Stock? U.S. Big Tech such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Meta (NASDAQ:META) are all designing AI chips. Amazon has leaned into training-focused chips, Meta started with inference and is expanding to training, while Google supports both through its TPU (tensor processing unit) lineup. For these hyperscalers, the motivation is not necessarily to beat Nvidia in the market but to lower costs, gain supply control, and improve bargaining power within their massive cloud ecosystems. Over time, that means less incremental demand for Nvidia’s GPUs. Over Q2, Nvidia said that just two of its customers made up roughly 39% of total revenue — likely these big U.S. tech firms — making it vulnerable if they shift workloads to in-house silicon or lower-cost suppliers. Chinese Internet Giants In China, companies like Alibaba (NYSE:BABA), Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), and Huawei are stepping up their AI chip efforts. Recent reports suggested that Alibaba plans to launch a new inference chip for its cloud division. The strategy is twofold: to power inference at scale using its own tech stack, and to secure a steady supply of semiconductors amid U.S. export restrictions. For now, Nvidia’s GPUs are still expected to form the backbone of Alibaba’s AI training workloads, but inference is likely to become the longer-term growth driver for the company. related Alibaba’s AI Chip A Big Deal? Beyond semiconductors, growing AI inference workloads will drive demand for supporting infrastructure. Fast, reliable, and intelligent networking will be critical to handle billions of requests daily. Companies like Arista Networks and Cisco are well-positioned to benefit, as ultra-low-latency, high-bandwidth interconnects become essential for moving massive datasets between servers, GPUs, and cloud nodes in real time. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming its benchmark that includes all 3 – S&P 500, Russell, and S&P midcap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
