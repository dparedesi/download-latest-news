Intel (INTC+7.42%) stock jumped more than 12% in after hours trading on Wednesday after the chip manufacturer announced that tech executive and former board member Lip-Bu Tan will be the company’s new chief executive officer, effective March 18. “Tan is a longtime technology investor and widely respected executive with more than 20 years of semiconductor and software experiences as well as deep relationships across Intel’s ecosystem,” the company said in a press release. Tan was formerly the CEO of Cadence Design Systems (CDNS+3.05%), where he more than doubled the company’s revenue and delivered a stock price appreciation of more than 3,200%. He was also on Intel’s board for two years until his departure in August 2024. “Lip-Bu is an exceptional leader whose technology industry expertise, deep relationships across the product and foundry ecosystems, and proven track record of creating shareholder value is exactly what Intel needs in its next CEO,” Frank D. Yeary, independent chair of the board who had taken upon the role of interim executive chair during the CEO search, said in the company’s press release. Tan will be taking over from interim co-CEOs David Zinsner and MJ Holthaus. The duo had replaced former CEO Patrick Gelsinger was ousted in December 2024 following a rocky period for the once-dominant chip company. The chipmaker has been struggling to keep pace with competitors like Nvidia (NVDA-2.55%), which replaced Intel in the Dow Jones Industrial Average back in November 2024. The company has also been the target of possible acquisitions, and has been working with investment bankers at Morgan Stanley (MS+1.78%) and Goldman Sachs (GS+1.39%) to save its business, including by splitting its foundry division, although nothing has been announced. Tan shared that he was “honored to join Intel” as CEO. “Intel has a powerful and differentiated computing platform, a vast customer installed base and a robust manufacturing footprint that is getting stronger by the day as we rebuild our process technology roadmap,” Tan said in the press release. Intel had a great trading day on Wednesday. The stock ended the day up more than 4% after a Reuters report broke that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM+0.44%) had approached chip giants Nvidia, AMD (AMD+3.24%), and Broadcom (AVGO-1.64%) to form a joint venture to run Intel’s foundry division.

Title: Stocks will be volatile until the cost of Trump's tariffs become clear, strategist says

Investors will need to have a sense of the cost of Donald Trump’s tariffs before the U.S. stock market finds a bottom, Empower’s chief investment strategist said, as reflected in the modest rebound in stocks after today’s better-than-expected CPI report. “I read the day one executive order on trade — it struck me that these tariffs are permanent features, not a negotiating tactic,” Marta Norton told Quartz. “The impact of the tariffs aren’t as easy to trace as you might think,” as shown by the now-suspended levies on the electricity Ontario sends to the U.S. Trump has injected a lot of uncertainty into markets with the tariffs, and expect a lot of volatility until that’s digested, Norton said. Even after the recent selloff, U.S. stock valuations remain high by historical standards, so there’s a lot of room for equities to decline. The S&P 500 was up about 0.8% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average about 66 points, or 0.2% as of 1:30 p.m. in New York. The Nasdaq did better, up about 1.6%, led by gains in Tesla (TSLA-6.52%), Nvidia (NVDA-2.40%) and chip stocks. Intel (INTC+7.63%) gained after Reuters reported that TSMC (TSM+0.51%) approached Nvidia, AMD (AMD+3.35%) and Broadcom (AVGO-1.59%) to set up a joint venture to run Intel’s chip foundries. The trade war won’t be helpful for inflation — every little bit counts when seeking to slow price gains — but the impact isn’t straightforward, according to Norton. For example, construction costs will probably rise because of duties on construction materials, but that may not affect shelter prices. The uncertainty means that the slide in U.S. equities may not represent a buying opportunity, especially given that valuations remain above average. “We’re hardly in 2022 again,” Norton said. “Maybe if you’re underweight it’s time to increase exposure, but not sure I’d be doubling down otherwise.” The selloff may not trigger an about face from Trump, given praise from unexpected quarters, including some labor unions. Norton said. “It struck me that there’s a distinction on what the investment community thinks and what Trump’s audience is — investors may not be Trump’s audience on this one.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Tesla (TSLA-6.37%), Nvidia (NVDA-2.55%), Palantir and chip stocks led a Nasdaq rebound on Wednesday. The Nasdaq Composite index ended the day with a 1.22% gain, following a February CPI report showing that inflation slowed more than expected last month. The rebound was more muted in the rest of the market, with the S&P 500 up only about 0.5% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average down about 0.2%. Tesla closed up 7.6% at a little over $248 a share, Nvidia ended the day up 6.43% to close at $115.74 a share. This followed a particularly rough start to the week, as investors became increasingly worried about the effects of President Donald Trump’s unpredictable tariff policies. Tesla stock, in particular, has been on a steady decline amid blowback over CEO Elon Musk’s political activities and his work to slash government spending through the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency. Protests against the company’s showrooms and facilities, as well as vandalism of Tesla cars, have increased recently. In response, Trump on Tuesday brought five Teslas to the White House’s southern lawn, including a cherry red Model S which he ended up purchasing. Also on Tuesday, Musk shared in an X post that Tesla would commit to doubling its vehicle production in the U.S. over the next two years. Tech giant Palantir (PLTR-1.36%) was another winner of Wednesday. Palantir shares ended the day up 7.18%, closing at $83.65 a share after the company announced late Tuesday that it will be hosting its sixth Artificial Intelligence Platform event on Thursday. Chip stocks were also up following news that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM+0.44%) approached chip giants Nvidia, AMD (AMD+3.24%), and Broadcom (AVGO-1.64%) to form a joint venture to run Intel’s (INTC+7.42%) foundry division. TSMC would run the operations, but would not own more than 50% of the assets, according to Reuters. Earlier in March, the White House announced that TSMC plans to invest at least $100 billion in building out chip manufacturing plants in the U.S. over the next four years. Intel gained 4.56%, TSMC 3.63%, AMD 4.17%, and Broadcom ended the day up 2.18% Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Stocks extended gains in premarket trading on Wednesday after an encouraging inflation report, indicating a possible rebound after the selloff on Monday and Tuesday. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures gained about 1%, S&P 500 futures rose 1.3%, and Nasdaq 100 futures popped 1.7% at about 8:45 a.m. in New York The CPI increased 0.2% in February from January, less than consensus estimates of a 0.3% increase, and slowing from the prior month’s 0.5% gain. Annual headline and core inflation eased slightly to 2.8% and 3.1%, respectively, also slightly slower than projected. Economists diverge on whether sticky inflation is likely to keep the Federal Reserve on hold this year, with some expecting no interest rate cut at all and others expecting up to three rate reductions as the labor market slows amid increased uncertainty driven by Trump’s economic policies. Helping matters: President Donald Trump on Tuesday afternoon canceled his doubling of tariffs on Canadian-made steel and aluminum to 50% after Premier Doug Ford of Ontario agreed to suspend a charge on electricity sent to the U.S. following a conversation with Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick.
