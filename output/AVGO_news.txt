U.S. stocks plunged Monday after the ISM manufacturing index came in lower than expected at 50.3, as new orders contracted and the price measure surged. Investors are also cautious ahead of planned tariffs on Mexico and Canada scheduled to come into effect on Tuesday. The S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite and Dow Jones Industrial Average all closed significantly lower. The Dow fell 650 points, or about 1.5%, while the S&P 500 was off 1.8% and the Nasdaq closed down 2.6%. Automakers, among the companies most affected by tariffs, gave up earlier gains and fell after President Trump reiterated that the duties will go into effect tomorrow. Ford (F-2.08%) dropped 1.7%, General Motors (GM-3.28%) declined 3.6% and Stellantis (STLA-4.46%) slipped 3%. All three have plants in Mexico and Canada. Tesla (TSLA-3.90%) fell 2.8%. Nvidia (NVDA+2.23%), Super Micro Computer (SMCI+7.96%), and Dell (DELL-0.24%) shares plunged Monday after Singapore said it’s investigating whether servers shipped to Malaysia containing chips barred from China ended up in the mainland. Stock in Intel (INTC-6.42%), Broadcom (AVGO+0.97%) and TSMC (TSM+4.33%) also declined. Kroger (KR+1.43%) stock fell 2.9% after CEO Rodney McMullen resigned following an investigation into his personal conduct. The grocery chain unveils its earnings report on Thursday.

Title: Intel could get a boost from Nvidia and Broadcom

Intel’s (INTC-6.42%) faltering chip manufacturing business could get a boost from its rivals. Nvidia (NVDA+2.23%) and Broadcom (AVGO+0.97%) are testing chip manufacturing with the chip pioneer on its most advanced 18A process for cutting-edge chips, such as those for artificial intelligence, Reuters reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. The tests are being carried out as the two chip designers decide on manufacturing contracts with Intel that could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars, according to Reuters — a move that could be a turnaround for Intel’s declining business. Intel’s shares were up by 3.2% during Monday morning trading, and are up by 22% so far this year. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD+1.86%) reportedly also is interested in using Intel for manufacturing, but it is not confirmed if the company is testing chips. An Intel spokesperson told Reuters that it sees “strong interest and engagement on Intel 18A across our ecosystem.” Neither Intel, Broadcom, nor AMD immediately responded to requests for comment. Nvidia declined to comment. In September, Reuters reported that Intel’s tests with Broadcom on its 18A process had failed, after Broadcom’s engineers determined it could not be used for high-volume chip production. The current tests with Nvidia and Broadcom are focused on the viability of Intel’s 18A manufacturing process and are not using finished chip designs, Reuters reported, adding that the tests could take months. In February 2024, Microsoft (MSFT-0.54%) announced that it was tapping Intel’s 18A manufacturing process for a future chip designed in-house. Former Intel chief executive Pat Gelsinger had started Intel’s contract manufacturing business in 2021, but it has not yet secured a major chip designer partner. Intel previously pushed back the 18A process to 2026, but is now delaying it by another six months, Reuters reported, citing supplier documents and unnamed people familiar with the matter. The delay has to do with qualifying intellectual property for the manufacturing process, according to Reuters. Intel told Reuters that it plans to “begin ramping production in the second half of this year, delivering on the commitments we have made to our customers.” Meanwhile, Intel has become an acquisition target for its competitors. Last month, the Wall Street Journal reported that Intel could see its business split in two by separate potential deals with Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM+4.33%). Broadcom is reportedly looking into Intel’s chip design and marketing unit, while TSMC is interested in its chip manufacturing plants.

Stocks erased morning gains and declined by afternoon on Monday as investors awaited President Donald Trump’s tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China set to take effect on Tuesday. As the day ended in New York, the S&P 500 slid 1.7%, while the Nasdaq dipped 2.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 1.4%. Here are stocks to watch today: Shares of Broadcom (AVGO+0.97%) declined as the semiconductor manufacturer prepares to report earnings after Thursday’s closing bell. Kroger’s (KR+1.43%) stock fell in the afternoon as CEO Rodney McMullen resigned following an investigation into his personal conduct. The news comes just ahead of the grocery chain’s earnings release on Thursday. Nvidia (NVDA+2.23%) shares fell on Monday as concerns mounted over AI-related spending and the impact of new tariffs set to take effect. The chip manufacturer seems to be cautious about limitations on the export of AI chips. Read here: Nvidia and Super Micro Computer stock plunge as a new probe over China raises concerns about tighter scrutiny Shares of Palantir (PLTR+0.33%were up on Monday as Wedbush analysts said the recent selloff in Palantir stock was misguided because the company’s “unique software value proposition” means it actually stands to benefit from initiatives by Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency. The company is also set to gain from the Trump administration’s focus on AI, a technology that’s sent Palantir toward a $1 trillion market capitalization and could make it the next Oracle (ORCL-3.28%or Salesforce (CRM-2.30%, the Wedbush analysts wrote. Super Micro Computer (SMCI+7.96%), a key player in AI hardware, also declined, mirroring Nvidia’s slump. Investors are uncertain about how Trump’s tariffs could shape the future of the AI industry. Shares of Elon Musk’s Tesla (TSLA-3.90%) surged over 3% on Monday after Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas restored the stock as a “Top Pick” in U.S. autos. His price target of $430 per share suggests a potential upside of more than 50% from Tesla’s current share price. Cryptocurrency-related companies and Bitcoin holders, including Coinbase (COIN+2.28%), Strategy (MSTR+7.11%), and Robinhood (HOOD-2.50%), surged Monday following Trump’s announcement of a strategic crypto reserve encompassing Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. — Josh Fellman contributed to the article Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

(Photo by Abdullah Guclu/Anadolu via Getty Images) See More On Trefis.com Broadcom stock (NASDAQ:AVGO) experienced a 7% decline on Thursday, February 27th, as part of a broader selloff affecting chip stocks. This market reaction followed the release of Nvidia’s earnings report and President Trump’s announcement of increased tariffs on China, as well as the imposition of tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, set to take effect next week. Separately, Should You Buy Monster Beverage Stock At $55? After its recent fall, AVGO stock looks attractive but volatile - making it a tricky pick to buy at its current price of around $200. We believe there is minimal cause for concern with AVGO stock, which makes it attractive but highly sensitive to adverse events as its current valuation is extremely high. We arrive at our conclusion by comparing the current valuation of AVGO stock with its operating performance over the recent years as well as its current and historical financial condition. Our analysis of Broadcom along key parameters of Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience shows that the company has a very strong operating performance and financial condition, as detailed below. Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, AVGO stock looks very expensive compared to the broader market. • Broadcom has a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 20.1 vs. a figure of 3.1 for the S&P 500 • Additionally, the company's price-to-operating income (P/EBIT) ratio is 69.0 compared to 24.4 for S&P 500 • And, it has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 51.9 vs. the benchmark’s 24.4 Broadcom's Revenues have grown considerably over recent years. • Broadcom has seen its top line grow at an average rate of 24.3% over the last 3 years (vs. 9.8% for S&P 500) • Its revenues have grown 44.0% from $36 Bil to $52 Bil in the last 12 months (vs. change of 5.6% for S&P 500) • Also, its quarterly revenues grew 51.2% to $14 Bil in the most recent quarter from $9.3 Bil a year ago (vs. 7.2% change for S&P 500) Broadcom's profit margins are much higher than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. • Broadcom's Operating Income over the last four quarters was $15 Bil, which represents a high Operating Margin of 29.1% (vs. 12.6% for S&P 500) • Broadcom’s Operating Cash Flow (OCF) over this period was $20 Bil, pointing to a high OCF-to-Sales Ratio of 38.7% (vs. 14.4% for S&P 500) Broadcom's balance sheet looks strong. • Broadcom's Debt figure was $68 Bil at the end of the most recent quarter, while its market capitalization is $925 Bil (as of 2/27/2025). This implies a strong Debt-to-Equity Ratio of 6.5% (vs. 19.7% for S&P 500). [Note: A lower Debt-to-Equity Ratio is desirable] • Cash (including cash equivalents) makes up $9 billion of the $166 billion in Total Assets for Broadcom. This yields a moderate Cash-to-Assets Ratio of 5.6% (vs. 14.1% for S&P 500) AVGO stock has been more resilient than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy, how bad can things get if there is another recession? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes. • AVGO stock fell 34.8% from a high of $62.71 on 4 January 2022 to $40.86 on 16 October 2022, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 17 May 2023 • Since then, the stock has increased to a high of $249.33 on 16 December 2024 and currently trades at around $200 • AVGO stock fell 46.8% from a high of $27.40 on 19 February 2020 to $14.57 on 18 March 2020, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 5 June 2020 In summary, Broadcom's performance across the parameters detailed above are as follows: • Growth: Extremely Strong • Profitability: Very Strong • Financial Stability: Strong • Downturn Resilience: Strong • Overall: Very Strong Hence, despite its extremely high valuation, the stock appears attractive but volatile, which supports our conclusion that AVGO is a tricky stock to buy. Not too happy about the volatile nature of AVGO stock? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that?

Title: Nvidia's strong earnings can't keep its stock from sliding — along with other chipmakers

Nvidia (NVDA+2.23%) and other semiconductor stocks gave up premarket gains and fell in early Thursday Wall Street trading. While the AI chipmaker yesterday posted earnings that surpassed fourth-quarter estimates with robust guidance, they may have fallen short of the complete blowout that some investors had anticipated. Rival chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices (AMD+1.86%), Micron (MU+0.68%), Broadcom (AVGO+0.97%), and Intel (INTC-6.42%) also declined, shedding pre-opening gains. “This is telling you more about the state/sentiment of the market, and [its] volatile nature ... than it tells you about how Nvidia is doing in our eyes,” Mahoney Asset Management CEO Ken Mahoney said before the open. “These results mean a lot for the stock market and the AI ecosystem.” Nvidia’s strong order book for its newest models is an indication that its customers are continuing to invest in artificial intelligence, and may lay to rest concerns that DeepSeek’s recently unveiled, cheaper AI model has prompted companies to defer or reduce their spending plans. “CEO commentary suggests Blackwell demand is ‘amazing,’ supported by strong top-line results,” Gabelli Funds’ John Belton said. “It should be a positive read for AI demand and the investment cycle.” Elsewhere, TSMC (TSM+4.33%) stock fell in Taipei on Thursday. Taiwan Economy Minister Kuo Jyh-huei said the chip foundry would need government permission for any overseas joint venture, but there are no restrictions on making the most-advanced chips overseas other than for China, Reuters reported. The Trump administration has pushed to have TSMC buy Intel’s chipmaking operations or at least operate them as a joint venture. The Taiwanese firm isn’t actually interested, and even the threat of tariffs probably won’t be enough to force a deal. The nation continues to negotiate with the U.S. to seek the best conditions possible for Taiwanese companies under possible new American tariffs, Kuo told the news agency. —Britney Nguyen contributed to this article.
