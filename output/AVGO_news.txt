Shares of AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) and a slew of other stocks related to AI sold off Monday as an app from Chinese AI startup DeepSeek boomed in popularity. DeepSeek's AI assistant recently topped the list of free iPhone apps on Apple's (AAPL) app store. (It wasn't in the top 10 on Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Play store, though it is listed there.) In Apple's store, the app ranked higher than ChatGPT; not so on Google. Here’s what you need to know about DeepSeek—and why it’s having a big impact on markets. And if you're wondering if it wasn't that long ago that another Chinese app was topping the download charts, you're not wrong. DeepSeek, a Chinese startup founded by hedge fund manager Liang Wenfeng, was founded in 2023 in Hangzhou, China, the tech hub home to Alibaba (BABA) and many of China’s other high-flying tech giants. The company says its latest R1 AI model released last week offers performance that is on par with that of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Its V3 base model launched in December was also reportedly developed in just two months for under $6 million, at a time when the U.S. is limiting China's access to its most sophisticated chips and American AI leaders like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta Platforms (META) are spending billions of dollars on development. The rapid ascension of DeepSeek has investors worried it could threaten assumptions about how much competitive AI models cost to develop, as well as the kind of infrastructure needed to support them, with wide-reaching implications for the AI marketplace and Big Tech shares. Nvidia in a statement called DeepSeek "an excellent AI advancement," calling it a "perfect example" of a concept known as test time scaling. The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell more than 3% Monday as investors dragged a host of stocks with ties to AI, from chip to energy firms, downwards. Shares of American AI chipmakers including Nvidia, Broadcom (AVGO) and AMD (AMD) sold off, along with those of international partners like TSMC (TSM). The PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX) dropped more than 9%. Networking solutions and hardware partner stocks dropped along with them, including Dell (Dell), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and Arista Networks (ANET). Some energy stocks were hit too. Shares of nuclear and other energy companies that saw their stocks boom in the last year in anticipation of an AI-driven boom in energy demand, such as Vistra (VST), Constellation Energy (CEG), Oklo (OKLO), and NuScale (SMR), also lost ground Monday. Meanwhile, some non-tech sectors like consumer staples rose Monday, marking a reconsideration of the market's momentum in recent months. Several analysts raised doubts about the longevity of the market’s reaction Monday, suggesting that the day's pullback could offer investors a chance to pick up AI names set for a rebound. Bernstein’s Stacy Rasgon called the reaction “overblown” and maintained an “outperform” rating for Nvidia’s stock price. Citi analysts, who said they expect AI companies to continue buying its advanced chips, maintained a "buy" rating on Nvidia. Wedbush analysts, who voiced skepticism that any major U.S. companies would use a Chinese startup like DeepSeek to build their AI infrastructure, said “launching a competitive LLM model for consumer use cases is one thing… launching broader AI infrastructure is a whole other ballgame and nothing with DeepSeek makes us believe anything different.” Wedbush called Monday a “golden buying opportunity” to own shares in ChatGPT backer Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet, Palantir (PLTR), and other heavyweights of the American AI ecosystem that had come under pressure.

Title: DeepSeek is limiting signups after a 'large-scale' cyberattack

Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek said it would temporarily limit signups after being the victim of “large-scale malicious attacks” on its servers. Existing users can log in without problems, the company said on its website. Earlier on Monday, the company said it would restrict signups for new users to people with a mainland China phone number. DeepSeek in December launched a free, open-source large language model, which it claimed it had developed in just two months for less than $6 million. Last week, the company launched a model that it said rivals OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Meta’s (META+2.53%) Llama 3.1 — and which rose to the top of Apple’s (AAPL+3.88%) App Store over the weekend. DeepSeek says it built the model using lower capability chips from Nvidia (NVDA+7.29%), which could put pressure on the major semiconductor maker. The reported cyberattacks come as DeepSeek’s advanced technology sparked a widespread sell-off on Monday morning. Nvidia’s stock plunged more than 15%, wiping out $18 billion of founder and CEO Jensen Huang’s net worth. Other major chip stocks also sank, including ASML (ASML-0.12%), Broadcom (AVGO+2.91%), Super Micro Computer (SMCI-2.79%), Micron (MU-2.27%), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM+4.61%) The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell by more than 600 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, an index of 30 of the largest U.S. companies including Nvidia, took a hit earlier on Monday but has since bounced back to a net 48-point gain. The S&P 500 is down almost 2%, or 107 points. “[T]he Street will view DeepSeek as a major perceived threat to U.S. tech dominance and owning this AI Revolution,” Wedbush Securities analysts led by Dan Ives said in a note. “While the model is impressive and it will have a ripple impact,” they added, U.S. tech companies are focused on achieving artificial general intelligence, with a focus on “the infrastructure and ecosystem that China and especially DeepSeek cannot come close to in our view.” —Rocio Fabbro and Vinamrata Chaturvedi contributed to this article Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: The Nvidia rout sends CEO Jensen Huang's net worth plummeting $18 billion

Nvidia (NVDA+7.29%) CEO Jensen Huang’s net worth plunged $18 billion Monday as the chipmaker’s stock continues to free fall. Huang was worth $106.3 billion as of Monday morning, down nearly 15%, according to Forbes Real-Time Billionaires list. Huang has an approximately 3% stake in Nvidia. Shares of Nvidia were down nearly 16% to around $120 apiece just before mid-day. The rout caused the semiconductor giant’s market capitalization to fall by more than $465 billion to $2.97 trillion — the biggest single-day decline in market value for a company, beating its own previous record set last September. That drop puts it below Apple (AAPL+3.88%) and Microsoft (MSFT+2.86%) as the third-most valuable company in the world. Just last week, Nvidia surpassed Apple to become the world’s most valuable company. Global technology stocks suffered a widespread sell-off Monday that sent all three major U.S. indices tumbling, after investors grew concerned over a perceived threat from Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek. Other major chip stocks also sank, including ASML (ASML-0.12%), Broadcom (AVGO+2.91%), Super Micro Computer (SMCI-2.79%), Micron (MU-2.27%), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM+4.61%). The tech-heavy Nasdaq plunged more than 600 points, or roughly 3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, an index of 30 of the largest U.S. companies including Nvidia, were also down more than 70 points, and the S&P 500 tumbled almost 2%. The sell-off was prompted by DeepSeek’s announcement last week that it launched a model rivaling OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Meta’s (META+2.53%) Llama 3.1 built using lower capability chips from Nvidia, which could put pressure on the semiconductor darling if other firms move away from its premium offerings. In December, the private company launched a free, open source large language model (LLM), which it claimed it had developed in just two months for less than $6 million. Analysts at Wedbush said in a research note Monday that “tech stocks are under massive pressure led by Nvidia as the Street will view DeepSeek as a major perceived threat to U.S. tech dominance and owning this AI Revolution.” However, they noted that the DeepSeek threat isn’t yet cause for concern, as U.S. companies remain ahead of the curve to achieving the next frontier of AI development: artificial general intelligence, or AGI.

Title: Why Nvidia Stock Is Plummeting Today
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/why-nvidia-stock-is-plummeting-today-deepseek-ai-wall-street-8780814
Time Published: 2025-01-27T15:41:21Z

Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) tumbled Monday after the release of a sophisticated artificial intelligence model from a Chinese startup prompted a reckoning on Wall Street regarding AI spending. Chinese company DeepSeek last week released R1, an AI model that appears to rival the capabilities of models from U.S. tech giants like OpenAI and Google despite running on fewer, less powerful chips. U.S. investors began to take notice of the model late last week, and over the weekend started to worry about what it means for richly valued U.S. tech stocks. Nvidia’s earnings and stock price have soared in the past two years as tech giants like Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG)(GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN) have spent massively on the company's AI systems. DeepSeek has led investors to question whether all that spending was necessary and, if not, why it would continue. Nvidia stock was hammered by Monday’s sell-off. Shares tumbled nearly 17%, its largest one-day drop since the Covid-19 crash in March 2020. Monday’s sell-off wiped about $589 billion from Nvidia’s market cap, the largest loss in history. Wall Street analysts were mostly skeptical about DeepSeek and the sell-off it prompted, though their commentary often reflected uncertainty about the effects DeepSeek could have on the market. Citi analysts expressed doubt that DeepSeek had achieved its results without the most advanced chips. They maintained their "buy" rating on Nvidia stock and said they don't expect major U.S. AI companies to move away from using its advanced GPUs. Jefferies analysts, however, noted DeepSeek's success could press Silicon Valley management to "refocus on efficiency and ROI, meaning lower demand for computing power as of 2026." Concern about future AI models requiring less computing power weighed on other high-flying AI stocks, including nuclear power providers Vistra (VST) and Constellation Energy Corp. (CEG), which slumped 28% and 21%, respectively. Nvidia competitor Broadcom (AVGO) also dropped about 17%.

Skip to comments. Posted on 01/27/2025 6:27:08 AM PST by lasereye Nasdaq futures plunged on Monday to lead a stock rout on Wall Street as a Chinese startup rattled faith in US leadership and profitability in AI, taking a hammer to Nvidia (NVDA) and other Big Tech stocks. Contracts on the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 (NQ=F) sank nearly 4%, while S&P 500 futures (ES=F) tumbled over 2%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) fell 0.9%, or about 380 points, on the heels of a winning week for the major gauges. Markets have been rattled by claims by China's DeepSeek that its AI assistant uses cheaper chips and less data than leading models, but performs equally well. A surge in DeepSeek's popularity has spurred a scramble by investors to reassess bets that AI demand-driven growth will keep fueling gains for stocks. AI bellwether Nvidia's shares tumbled over 11% in pre-market trading, as chip-related names took a bruising. ASML lost 9%, while Arm (ARM), Broadcom (AVGO), and Micron Technology (MU) also got hammered. Shares of Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) both slid about 6% amid worries about megacaps' hefty investment in AI. Tesla (TSLA) and Amazon (AMZN) also lost ground as techs sold off across the board. Big Tech earnings season kicks off this week, highlighted by results from Apple (AAPL), Tesla, Meta, and Microsoft. Eyes will be on guidance for future profit as DeepSeek casts doubt on prospects for revenue. Investors started to flock to assets seen as safe as stocks plunged. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) fell as much as 12 basis points to 4.50%, the lowest level in over a month, while haven currencies including the yen and the Swiss franc surged.

A surge in DeepSeek's popularity has spurred a scramble by investors to reassess bets that AI demand-driven growth will keep fueling gains for stocks. AI bellwether Nvidia's shares tumbled over 11% in pre-market trading, as chip-related names took a bruising. ASML lost 9%, while Arm (ARM), Broadcom (AVGO), and Micron Technology (MU) also got hammered. Shares of Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) both slid about 6% amid worries about megacaps' hefty investment in AI. Tesla (TSLA) and Amazon (AMZN) also lost ground as techs sold off across the board.

Title: DeepSeek sell-off reminds investors of the biggest earnings story holding up the stock market

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Monday's swift sell-off in the markets serves as a reminder for not only what's been the driving force of the bull market thus far, but also what investors have been expecting to come in 2025. It's all about Big Tech earnings. New developments from Chinese artificial intelligence company DeepSeek sparked the rout as investor concerns over brewing competition in the AI space for Nvidia (NVDA) and other Big Tech names prompted a pause in the US AI trade. Nvidia stock dropped more than 16%. Meanwhile, fellow "Magnificent Seven" members Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), and Tesla (TSLA) were all off 2% or more. Broadcom (AVGO), another large player in the AI space, fell over 17%. "When expectations are high, one skeptical headline can knock the market off its axis," Ritholtz Wealth Management chief markets strategist Callie Cox wrote in a note on Monday. "That’s exactly what we’re seeing today." A slowdown in Big Tech's rapid earnings growth has been a risk to the market that strategists have been talking about for more than a year. With index valuations near multi-decade highs and the 10 largest stocks comprising nearly 40% of the S&P 500, strategists have argued the rapid rally in stocks is increasingly on thin ice. "You have so much concentration in one area of the market — this has been the AI dominant themed market — and all of a sudden you bring in some uncertainty to that market, the initial reaction is to sell first and ask questions later," Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner told Yahoo Finance. Unlike other risks like higher interest rates or sticky inflation, there hasn't been a clear story for why the exceptional Big Tech earnings growth story would collapse. For now, DeepSeek's new AI model appears to be a tangible reason for investors to question whether the high earnings expectations will truly follow through. "The biggest risks are the ones that we're not talking about," Lerner said. "And everyone thinks it's tariffs and China. And, you know, really, what we're finding out is [DeepSeek] wasn't on anyone's bingo card." In 2024, Magnificent Seven earnings outperformed the rest of the S&P 500 index by 30 percentage points, per research from Goldman Sachs. And while that margin is expected to slow in the year ahead, causing some to call for a broadening out of stock market returns, Big Tech earnings growth remains a key pillar of the bull market thesis. The "Magnificent Seven" stocks are expected to grow earnings by 21.7% in the fourth quarter compared to the 9.7% earnings growth projected for the other 493 tech stocks. The year-over-year growth rate for the "Magnificent Seven" is expected to slow in the first quarter before accelerating once more to year-over-year earnings growth of more than 24% in the third quarter. Lerner reasoned that Monday's sell-off brought investors "back to fundamentals." "Washington matters, but there's other factors, in totality, that will likely matter more," Lerner said. "Tech is at the forefront of the overall return for the market this year." Josh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow him on X @_joshschafer.

Title: The Nasdaq sinks more than 800 points as a China AI threat sparks a huge tech stock sell-off

The tech-heavy Nasdaq slipped 3% Monday afternoon as a perceived threat from Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek prompted a global sell-off of tech stocks. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, an index of 30 of the largest U.S. companies including Nvidia (NVDA), went up 109 points or 0.2% as of Monday afternoon. Moreover, the S&P 500 tumbled by 1.8%. The Nasdaq, which has been significantly boosted by AI hype, is especially susceptible to any investor concerns, especially when it comes to AI. And the rise of any competitor to U.S. dominance in the space, especially one that uses less energy and has less of a need for high-end chips, can cause fears to spike. DeepSeek in December launched a free, open source large language model (LLM), which it claimed it had developed in just two months for less than $6 million. Last week, the company said it launched a model that rivals OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Meta’s (META) Llama 3.1 — and which rose to the top of Apple’s (AAPL) App Store over the weekend. Most notably, DeepSeek built the model using lower capability chips from Nvidia, which could put pressure on the semiconductor darling if other firms move away from its premium offerings. Read more: Nvidia stock plunges 14% as a big advance by China’s DeepSeek rattles AI investors Analysts at Wedbush said in a research note Monday that “tech stocks are under massive pressure led by Nvidia as the Street will view DeepSeek as a major perceived threat to U.S. tech dominance and owning this AI Revolution.” The sell-off was led by Nvidia, whose stock fell as much as 16% Monday afternoon. Other major chip stocks also sank, including ASML (ASML), Broadcom (AVGO), Super Micro Computer (SMCI), Micron (MU), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM). “U.S. tech companies are trading at premium valuations, with major AI players like Nvidia, Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOGL) commanding forward [price-to-earnings] multiples far above historical averages,” said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at investment platform Saxo, in a statement. “With these stocks priced for perfection, even minor disruptions, such as DeepSeek proving advanced AI can be built without top-tier chips, could weigh heavily on share prices.” Analysts at Wedbush said DeepSeek is not yet a real threat to U.S. hyperscalers, and could prompt further capital expenditure from major firms like Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet, and Microsoft. This week, significant earnings reports are due from big tech companies, such as Apple (AAPL), Tesla (TSLA), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT).

Nvidia (NVDA) stock plunged 16% Monday afternoon after Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek’s latest model raised questions about American competitiveness in the AI space. DeepSeek in December launched a free, open source large language model (LLM), which it claimed it had developed in just two months for less than $6 million.

Shares of semiconductor giant Broadcom (AVGO) have almost doubled over the past year. Follow TipRanks' Top Wall Street Analysts to uncover their success rate and average return.

I last wrote about Broadcom in December 2024, when the stock was trading at $162 per share, with the stock currently 50% higher since then. The past year was great for long-term bulls, but investors who had their eye on the stock without pulling the trigger may be feeling some sententious FOMO (the fear of missing out) right about now. Fret not; yield-seeking, dividend-loving, capital-gains-hunting tech-savvy portfolio holders. Despite its monumental one-year run, it’s not too late to invest in Broadcom. I’m bullish on the company despite the upward re-rating, based on its history of generating exceptional long-term returns, the massive growth potential of the AI chip market, and its compelling track record as a strong dividend growth stock, all of which make it an appealing opportunity for long-term investors. The primary reason why it’s not too late to invest in Broadcom after its big year is because its recent metrics are nothing new for the stock — Broadcom is a long-term performer, not a flash in the pan. In fact, over the past decade, Broadcom has generated a stellar total return of 2,850% for investors, far exceeding broader benchmarks. While it has been a good decade for equity investors, the S&P 500 (SPX), as represented by the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO), has generated a total return of 256% over the same period, meaning that Broadcom generated ~10x the return of the broader market. An investor who put $10,000 into Broadcom 10 years ago would have an investment worth $280,500 today, while an investor who put $10,000 into VOO would have an investment worth $25,584 today. Even when looking at the more tech-centric Nasdaq 100 (NDAQ), Broadcom has outperformed. The Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) has generated a strong 456% total return over the past decade, but this strong performance still pales in comparison to Broadcom’s stellar return. Winners tend to win for a reason, and they tend to keep winning over time, which gives me confidence that it’s not too late for investors to add Broadcom to their long-term portfolio. While the law of large numbers means Broadcom’s returns are unlikely to match those of the previous decade in the years ahead, the stock is well-positioned to deliver strong results (and returns) for its shareholders. Broadcom’s spectacular performance over the years has somewhat overshadowed the fact that it is also an outstanding dividend stock, ranking in the top three in a recent TipRanks’ Best Dividend Stocks comparison. While shares yield just 1%, below the 1.3% average yield for the S&P 500, the company has a solid record of growing its dividend payout. Broadcom has paid dividends to shareholders for 14 consecutive years and has increased its nominal payout yearly. Moreover, the semiconductor maker has grown its dividend at an impressive 14% compound annual growth rate over the past five years. The company also maintains a conservative dividend payout ratio of under 50%, so there is ample room to increase the dividend as earnings increase. While today’s 1% yield may look underwhelming, this penchant for dividend growth means that long-term shareholders will likely enjoy a superior yield-on-cost as the company continues to grow its dividend payout over the long term. Broadcom is a major player in AI chips, and while this market has garnered more hype than substance so far, there is strong reason to expect growth in this sprawling sector in the years ahead. Precedence Research estimates that the size of the AI chip market totaled $73 billion in 2024 and expects it to grow at a remarkable 29% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next decade, reaching $928 billion by 2034. Obviously, a lot can happen between now and 2034, so these numbers are best taken with a few grains of salt, but they illustrate the scale of the likely market for AI chips in the long term. Broadcom predicts that the company can haul in $60-90 billion in sales of its custom AI chips in 2027, up from an AI revenue base of $12 billion in 2024. Given this massive growth potential, it’s unsurprising that analysts also forecast Broadcom to achieve continued earnings growth in the years ahead. Wall Street analysts expect Broadcom’s EPS to grow 30% to $6.35 per share in 2025 before ramping up a further ~20% to $7.65 in 2026 and reaching $9.10 in 2027. Turning to Wall Street, AVGO has received a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 23 Buy, three Hold, and zero Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average analyst AVGO stock price target of $237.08 per share implies a 2.15% potential downside from current levels. See more AVGO analyst ratings Broadcom stock has almost doubled in value over the past 12 months, but long-term tech-focused investors who didn’t pull the trigger on AVGO a year or so ago mustn’t develop MOFO or regret missing the boat. The stock is a perennial darling for shareholders with an exemplary history of generating strong cumulative returns for years on end. I remain bullish on Broadcom based on its excellent track record and its compelling history of dividend growth. While the AI chip market has, to some degree, been lifted by market hype, we are still in the early innings of the AI story, which leaves ample potential for the future, especially for investors with a long enough investment horizon to commit to a resilient trend-setter in the early days.
