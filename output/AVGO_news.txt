We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia stock (NVDA) is on pace for a comfortable triple-digit percentage gain again in 2024, after a nearly 240% surge in 2023. This year's rise is due in no small part to a product that wasn’t even shipped until the last quarter of the year — Blackwell. It’s the largest GPU (graphics processing unit) ever built, created by connecting two dies via a high bandwidth interface (HBI). In layperson’s terms, that translates to a lot of power at high efficiency, which is why it's been in such demand from the so-called hyperscalers — companies like Alphabet (GOOG) and Microsoft (MSFT) that are building out huge data centers to power large language models (LLMs). That hot demand for Blackwell and the 170% surge in Nvidia shares is what led Yahoo Finance to name the chip its 2024 Product of the Year. Read more: Here's why Walmart won the 2024 Yahoo Finance Company of the Year award “Technically, Blackwell is a beast,” Matt Kimball, an analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, told Yahoo Finance in an email. “Blackwell is an exponential leap forward as it is a dual GPU on a single chip with faster connectivity, a larger pool of high bandwidth memory (HBM3E), and the introduction of NVIDIA’s decompression engine to make data processing much faster (up to 6x relative to Hopper).” First announced in March, Blackwell is in the right place at the right time. Data centers that power generative AI or LLMs are currently occupied with inputting data and training those models. Blackwell and its predecessor, Hopper, are well-suited for that work. Blackwell represents an enormous advancement in power. It contains 208 billion transistors, more than two and a half times the number in Hopper. Its GB200 NVL72 server, which combines 72 Blackwell GPUs with 36 Grace CPUs, clocks up to a 30x performance increase compared to the same number of Hopper GPUs for LLM inference workloads. It also uses up to 25x less energy. “For us to leapfrog ourselves by an order of magnitude is pretty unheard of,” Dion Harris, director of accelerated data center, HPC (high-performance computing), and AI at Nvidia, said in a phone interview. “We were limited by physics, but we recognized that innovation with the HBI would allow us to extend the die-level communication and compute.” US business spending on generative AI has sextupled in a year, going from $2.3 billion in 2023 to $13.8 billion in 2024, according to Menlo Ventures. And the trend is only going up, as major companies from banking and retail to tech and hospitality race to introduce advanced chatbots and assistants to their customers. Nvidia's clients are paying dearly for their chips. The company doesn't break out Blackwell sales specifically, but KeyBanc analyst John Vinh estimates that Blackwell will account for $4 billion to $5 billion in sales in the current quarter. "After Q4, we should start to see a pretty quick ramp," he said in a phone interview. "For next year, we’re modeling $187 billion in compute data center revenues, of which 80% of that should be Blackwell." "Having such dominant market share, they have pricing power," he added. "As a hyperscaler, you pretty much have to pay Nvidia whatever they want." Nvidia’s rivals such as AMD (AMD) and even Amazon (AMZN) are working hard to develop their own alternatives. How long the GPU giant’s AI chip dominance can last has been up for debate ever since its shocking upside revenue beat in May 2023. Those questions have gotten louder as of late. Its shares have pulled back 12% from their record close on Nov. 7. And since the beginning of December, other semiconductor news has been getting buzz, including Amazon’s Trainium2 and Nova semiconductors. Broadcom (AVGO) has been gaining steam following its earnings report, catapulting its market cap to over $1 trillion. The crux of the excitement is the company's contract AI chip business, which CEO Hock Tan said would reach a "total serviceable market" of $60 billion to $90 billion by 2027. That said, "No one has been able to come out with a successful custom solution" that matches Nvidia's, Vinh said. Because Nvidia's earnings have been growing at a rapid clip alongside its share price, its valuation has remained competitive with other chipmakers. Its forward price-to-earnings ratio, for example, stands at nearly 31, compared to 25 for AMD and 46 for Broadcom, according to Yahoo Finance data. Companies like Amazon remain Nvidia customers even as they develop competing products. Nvidia dominates the market for training generative AI models — accounting for roughly 85% share — “and they’re not losing,” said Ben Bajarin, CEO of Creative Strategies. But once that training is complete, the models will turn to inference — putting all that information they’ve digested and learned to work. The power needed for inference is generally lower than that of training, though Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has consistently maintained that his company’s chips are well-suited to that stage as well. One factor in whether customers will continue to buy is cost. In addition to being the most advanced chips, Nvidia’s are also the most expensive. The company touts its TCO, or total cost of ownership, emphasizing computing power relative to energy usage over the life of the chips. “I doubt they’ll have the same market share they have today in inference,” Bajarin said. “There will be much more competition for inference.” Thus far, however, Nvidia’s biggest point of friction has been its own supply chain. A chip of Blackwell’s complexity and power has hit manufacturing and design snags, as Huang has acknowledged. After delays, the chip is expected to ship this Q4 and ramp up production next year. “Blackwell production is in full steam,” Huang said in the company's latest earnings call. “I think we're in great shape with respect to the Blackwell ramp at this point.” Still, the company said demand will exceed supply for several quarters. Nvidia's pace of overall sales growth is predicted to slow over the next year, a factor of the "law of large numbers," Jordan Klein, analyst at Mizuho Group, said in an email. Nvidia's sales rose by 126% in calendar 2023 over the prior year. They'll rise by 111% this year, according to analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, and 52% next year. "Nothing to worry about really, demand still exceeds supply," Klein said.

Title: What's Happening With Broadcom Stock?

SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA - DECEMBER 12: A sign is posted in front of a Broadcom office on December 12, ... [+] 2024 in San Jose, California. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ: AVGO), a semiconductor, enterprise software, and security solutions provider, has seen its stock surge over 40% in a week. This can be attributed to better than expected earnings and outlook, followed by stock upgrades from some of the large Wall Street institutions. Also see, Buy, Sell, Or Hold Bitcoin? Broadcom recently reported its Q4 fiscal 2024 results (fiscal ends in October), with revenues of $14.05 billion and earnings of $1.42 per share, versus the consensus estimates of $14.09 billion and $1.38, respectively. Broadcom is seeing a stellar demand for its AI products, a trend expected to continue in the coming years. Let’s dive deeper into the company’s recent performance and the impact on its stock price. Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. Broadcom’s revenue of 14.05 billion in Q4 was up a stellar 51% y-o-y. This can partly be attributed to the contribution from VMware, which it acquired for $69 billion last year. Apart from VMware, Broadcom’s AI products contributed to its top-line growth. The company’s AI revenue in fiscal 2024 stood at $12.2 billion, reflecting a whopping 220% y-o-y growth, driven by strong demand for its AI XPUs (Broadcom’s custom AI accelerators) and Ethernet products. Broadcom is benefiting from the generative AI boom, with its wide suite of networking and storage solutions, cybersecurity, and semiconductor offerings. Broadcom also announced that it’s developing AI chips with three large cloud companies, which reportedly include Google and Meta. The company’s outlook of $14.6 billion in Q1 fiscal 2025 also reflects a strong 22% y-o-y growth. Not only did the company post strong revenues in Q4, its adjusted operating margin expanded 90 bps y-o-y to 62.7%. Higher revenues and margin expansion resulted in the bottom line of $1.42 on an adjusted basis, versus $1.11 in the prior-year quarter. Also, look at What's Behind The 500% Rise In RGTI Stock? Admirably, AVGO stock has generated better returns than the broader market in each of the last 4 years. Returns for the stock were 56% in 2021, -13% in 2022, 104% in 2023, and 104% so far this year. Similarly, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Broadcom’s solid growth for its AI products and guidance prompted an upward revision for its stock price by several Wall Street analysts. That said, most of the estimates are now met, after a large 40% move seen in a week. At its current levels of $250, AVGO stock now trades at 23x trailing revenues, versus the stock’s average P/S ratio of 5x over the last three years. Now, the company’s acquisition of VMware, the massive opportunity in generative AI with its chips, as well as networking products, and strong profitability does warrant a meaningful upward revision in valuation multiple. After its recent rally, AVGO has now become the eighth stock to exceed the $1 trillion market capitalization. Notably, the $226 average of analysts price estimate for AVGO stock implies that it’s now fully valued. While AVGO stock looks like it is fully valued, it is helpful to see how Broadcom’s Peers fare on metrics that matter.

Nvidia (NVDA-1.14%) stock is in correction territory, and rival chipmaker Broadcom’s (AVGO-6.91%) late-year boost took a hit Tuesday morning. Shares of Nvidia fell 2.9% Tuesday, trading at $128.17, after slumping into a correction by market close the day before. A correction typically refers to when a stock falls 10% or more from an all-time high closing price. Nvidia stock rallied to an all-time high of $148.87 in early November. Competing semiconductor manufacturer Broadcom ended its hot streak after closing up more than 11% Monday and ending the day at $250. Broadcom stock fell more than 5% in Tuesday morning trading, to $326.54 per share. So far this month, shares of Broadcom are up roughly 50%, putting the stock on track to have its best month ever and adding hundreds of billions to its market capitalization. Broadcom now has a market cap of $1.17 trillion. Nvidia stock is still up more than 170% year-to-date. Broadcom shares have climbed 130% in the same period. As Nvidia sinks and Broadcom soars, the latter chipmaker is finally having its own “Nvidia moment,” Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote in a Monday note reported by MarketWatch (NWSA-2.02%). The company’s “robust AI story is finding its own ‘Nvidia moment’ with a likely sharp new product ramp into [the second half of] 2025, and outlook for material opportunity … a few years out,” Rasgon said. Despite a “fairly lousy” core business outside of artificial intelligence, Broadcom posted promising fourth-quarter earnings last week that beat Wall Street estimates and provided upbeat guidance for the year to come. This past fiscal year, Broadcom generated a record $30.1 billion in semiconductor revenue, driven by AI revenue of $12.2 billion, the company said. AI revenue alone grew 220% on an annual basis, fueled by the company’s AI XPUs and Ethernet networking portfolio. Broadcom is expecting first quarter revenue of approximately $14.6 billion, with EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) of 66% of projected revenue over the three months. In a call with analysts, company leadership said it sees the opportunity “over the next three years in AI as massive.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Broadcom’s ‘Nvidia moment’ has arrived. Now it needs to deliver

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- Broadcom Inc.’s massive rally after last week’s earnings report is reminiscent of when Nvidia Corp. shares first started to take off back in 2023. The chipmaker now needs to prove it can follow through to become another giant of the artificial intelligence era. Most Read from Bloomberg How California Sees the World, and Itself Hong Kong's Expat Party Hub Reshaped by Chinese Influx London’s Tube Fares Are Set to Rise by 4.6% Next Year Broadcom shares have soared 38% through Monday’s close — the two trading days since it reported results — pushing the company’s market capitalization to nearly $1.2 trillion. At the heart of the rally is Broadcom’s prediction that the addressable market for AI components it designs for data center operators will be as big as $90 billion by fiscal 2027. But there’s a lot to be done to turn that opportunity into reality. Shares fell as much as 4.7% in early trading Tuesday. “This is kind of like the Nvidia moment of maybe a year-and-a-half ago where they blew the number out and everybody had to catch up and chase it,” said Ken Mahoney, chief executive officer at Mahoney Asset Management, which owns the stock. Broadcom is showing investors that the demands from AI computing are so big that there’s plenty of room for other winners aside from Nvidia, Mahoney said. Broadcom was having a strong year even before last week’s results, with solid growth in its AI business underpinning its performance as one of the top stocks in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index. Still, it hasn’t been a completely smooth ride: The shares plunged in September after the company gave a disappointing forecast because of weakness in its non-AI operations. This quarter’s results have turned the focus squarely back to AI. Broadcom shares are now up more than 110% year-to-date, set for the best annual performance since their 2009 listing. Analysts have been scrambling to keep up, with multiple Wall Street firms hiking price targets and estimates following the earnings. Still, even a 19% jump in the average analyst target since the results has failed to keep pace with the shares, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This trajectory has inevitably spurred comparisons with Nvidia, the stock market’s original AI winner. Nvidia followed its blowout earnings report in May 2023 with a series of estimate-beating results and quarterly forecasts. It has also defied skeptics who said 2024 would be tough for the shares. Nvidia is up about 159% this year, but has pulled back in the past few days — possibly because investors are considering the prospect of rising competition from Broadcom. “I see a lot of parallels between Broadcom and Nvidia,” said Joe Tigay, portfolio manager of the Rational Equity Armor Fund, who sees reason to believe Broadcom’s stock can show sustainable gains in the same way as Nvidia. “Obviously Broadcom still needs to deliver to justify a 38 times multiple, but it has shown good growth and execution this year.” That multiple — the price investors have to pay for shares relative to earnings projected over the next 12 months — is pushing deeper into record territory. That may suggest Broadcom has limited room for error, though Nvidia has set a bullish precedent for investors wanting to jump onto the next big potential AI winner. Nvidia’s profits grew so fast last year that the valuation actually got cheaper as the stock rose, because estimates were being raised at an even faster clip. Estimates for Broadcom’s net earnings per share for fiscal 2025 have risen 12% in the past week. Still, not every “Nvidia moment” has turned into a sustained gain, with some companies failing to live up to expectations or seeing share-price rallies stall. Arm Holdings Plc gave a bullish forecast in February, and said it was “only at the beginning” of the AI boom. That sparked a 93% surge in the stock over the next three sessions, but the shares haven’t progressed much since then and are now down more than 20% from a July peak. “It is too soon to say whether we’re going to see a series of blowout reports like we’ve gotten from Nvidia,” said Alec Young, chief investment strategist at Mapsignals. “Broadcom has done a really good job, but these things don’t always end well.” Top Tech Stories TikTok and its Chinese parent company asked the US Supreme Court to block a government ban set to take effect next month, invoking favorable comments about the popular social-media platform from President-elect Donald Trump. Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. has agreed to sell its Intime department store business to Youngor Fashion Co. for around $1 billion in a move to offload non-core assets. Kioxia Holdings Corp. was supposed to be an irresistible debutant in a hot Japanese market, heralding the rise of a homegrown chipmaker with big backers and a storied pedigree. It may get a cooler reception than anticipated. Beijing-based Zhipu raised a further 3 billion yuan ($412 million) to power its artificial intelligence development efforts.

Another day, another rally by mega tech stocks. Shares of iPhone maker Apple, Google-parent Alphabet, electric car maker Tesla and AI-chipmaker Broadcom all rallied to new all-time highs, which helped power the tech-heavy Nasdaq to its own record peak. The Nasdaq closed up 1.24%, or 247.17 points, at a record 20,173.89. The broad S&P 500 index ended up 0.38%, or 22.99 points, at 6,074.08 and the blue-chip Dow slipped for an eight consecutive session for its longest streak of declines since 2018. It closed down 0.25%, or 110.58 points, at 43,717.48. All eyes are on the Federal Reserve's policy meeting, which ends on Wednesday afternoon. Although the Fed's expected to trim its short-term, benchmark fed funds rate again by a quarter percentage point, many economists expect the central bank to signal a slower pace of rate cuts next year and revise its economic outlook. "This could be the last cut for a while," said Jacob Channel, senior economist at comparison site LendingTree. "Because the upcoming Trump Administration’s policies might cause a resurgence in inflation or otherwise throw the economy off balance, the Fed might choose to take a wait-and-see approach and hold rates steady at their January meeting." Capitalize on high interest rates: Best current CD rates The day's winners included: Broadcom (AVGO): The chip software company extended its rally off its better-than-expected earnings report late Thursday and strong outlook. Shares are now up more than 120% for the year. Bitcoin: The cryptocurrency surged to an all-time high above $107,000 after MicroStrategy said it bought an additional 15,350 bitcoin, bringing its total holdings to 439,000, worth about $46 billion. Companies with the largest declines included: Super Micro Computer (SMCI): The AI server company said its auditor resigned this fall and its shares will be axed from the Nasdaq-100. Nvidia (NVDA): The AI chip company's shares slipped, putting it officially into correction territory, traders said. Shares are down more than 10% from its closing high of $148.88 reached last month. Analysts said money's moving into other AI-related companies after Nvidia's 166% run up this year. Oil fell 1% to $70.58 per barrel after China reported soft retail sales data. The 10-year Treasury yield dipped to 4.397% ahead of an expected Fed rate cut. Medora Lee is a money, markets and personal finance reporter at USA TODAY.

Investing.com -- As the second week of December ended, several stocks experienced significant volatility, mostly as a reaction to their earnings results. Out of many, here are Investing.com’s stocks of the week: Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) experienced a sharp decline after reporting disappointing guidance on Thursday, leading several analysts, including those from RBC Capital, Mizuho (NYSE:MFG), Piper Sandler, and Oppenheimer, to lower their price targets to a range of $590–$620. RBC Capital cut its price target to $590 from $610, citing reduced estimates but maintained an Outperform rating. The firm noted that Adobe’s quarterly results were solid, with record DM net-new ARR, although the upside was smaller compared to recent quarters. "ADBE has been a frustrating stock for much of FY24. Having said that, we remain confident ADBE will significantly monetize its Generative AI innovations going forward, and we expect healthy upside to the FY25 ARR/revenue guidance as the year unfolds.," an analyst at Mizuho said. On Friday, Adobe’s stock continued to decline, trading about 2% lower at $465. Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock saw positive reaction after its earnings, buoyed by upbeat guidance and surging AI revenues. The company hit a trillion-dollar valuation on Friday and shares climbed over 24%. Cantor Fitzgerald reaffirmed its Overweight rating and a $250 price target for the stock. “We see the strength in AI continuing at a rapid pace for AVGO, and the company has laid out a SAM of $60B–$90B with its three AI customers that it currently does business with,” an analyst at Piper Sandler noted. This week, Warner Bros Discovery Inc (NASDAQ:WBD) announced its new corporate structure, under which Warner Bros. Discovery will serve as the parent company for two distinct operating divisions - Global Linear Networks and Streaming & Studios. "We continue to prioritize ensuring our Global Linear Networks business is well positioned to continue to drive free cash flow, while our Streaming & Studios business focuses on driving growth by telling the world’s most compelling stories," according to the firm's President and CEO, David Zaslav. The company expects to complete the implementation of the new corporate structure by mid-2025. The new structure is expected to give it more flexibility. Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google kicked off the week by unveiling a new chip called Willow, which demonstrates advanced error correction and performance capabilities, paving the way for a functional, large-scale quantum computer. The tech giant also unveiled Gemini 2.0, its latest AI model, which Google claims is its most advanced yet. Even though shares rose during the week following these announcements, Alphabet shares ended the week down by 1.11%. Separately, The Information reported on Thursday that Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai was expected to meet with President-elect Donald Trump.
