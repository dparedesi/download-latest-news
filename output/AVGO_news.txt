Title: Appaloosa's Tepper Sells Off Chunks of Chinese Tech Stakes

Time Published: 2025-05-16T12:47:10Z
Full Content:
Billionaire investor David Tepper apparently no longer thinks it's time to buy "everything" in China. Tepper's hedge fund Appaloosa L.P. slashed its stakes in several Chinese companies in recent months, according to the firm's latest 13-F filing. The fund slashed its position in Baidu (BIDU) nearly in half and its stakes in Alibaba Group (BABA), JD.com (JD), Temu parent PDD Holdings (PDD), and Chinese real estate platform KE Holdings (BEKE) by 19% to 26% since its last filing in February. It also lowered its stake in the iShares China Large Cap ETF (FXI) and KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF (KWEB) by about 16% and 13%, respectively. In an interview with CNBC last September, the owner of the NFL's Carolina Panthers said the government stimulus package China was putting into its economy at the time made it an attractive place for investors. Tepper said he would want to buy "everything" in the country, as the stimulus would impact assets from stocks to ETFs and bonds. The latest filing also revealed that Appaloosa opened a 130,000-share position in Broadcom (AVGO) in the last three months, and that it sold the last of its stakes in FedEx (FDX) and Intel (INTC). The firm also boosted its shares of Meta Platforms (META), and cut its ownership of Lyft (LYFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Oracle (ORCL) and Microsoft (MSFT).

Title: What's Behind The 300% Rise In AVGO Stock?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CANADA - 2025/01/28: In this photo illustration, the Broadcom logo is seen displayed on a smartphone ... More screen. (Photo Illustration by Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Although Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ: AVGO) has seen an approximate 4% decline year-to-date, reflecting a broader decline in the NASDAQ index influenced by uncertain macroeconomic conditions, including ongoing tariffs and trade tensions, some of these worries have recently lessened. The landmark trade agreement between the U.S. and U.K., along with the recent 90-day pause in high tariffs between the U.S. and China, indicates a possible change in this situation. Despite this recent downturn, AVGO stock has achieved considerable long-term growth, rising over 300% since the beginning of 2023. This impressive performance is mainly due to the following factors: We will explore the details of these factors. While AVGO stock has performed remarkably well, if you are looking for an upside with a smoother experience than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has surpassed the S&P, achieving >91% returns since its inception. Broadcom’s remarkable recent performance is significantly due to two main factors: its rapidly growing AI product line and the strategic acquisition of VMware in 2023. This collaboration has instigated a noteworthy 64% rise in Broadcom’s revenue, increasing from $33 billion in 2022 to $55 billion over the last twelve months. A pivotal element contributing to this growth is the company’s AI revenue, which reached $12.2 billion in the fiscal year 2024, showcasing an impressive 220% year-over-year increase. This growth in AI revenue is propelled by robust market demand for Broadcom’s custom AI accelerators (XPUs) along with its Ethernet products. Through its extensive suite of networking and storage solutions, cybersecurity offerings, and semiconductor products, Broadcom has strategically aligned itself to make the most of the ongoing generative AI surge. Broadcom has consistently maintained an adjusted net margin exceeding 45% in recent years. This strong recent profitability is a result of its strategic engagement with the expanding AI market, especially through high-demand custom AI accelerators and networking solutions. The transformative acquisition of VMware has further enhanced revenue and margins by incorporating a substantial infrastructure software component with an emphasis on recurring subscriptions. Alongside continued strength in their core semiconductor business and a constant focus on operational efficiency and strong cash flow generation, these aspects have positioned Broadcom for enduring financial success. Broadcom’s custom AI accelerators (XPUs) have been a vital factor in the company’s financial transformation and a key element in its improved overall valuation. This effect is evident in Broadcom’s adjusted price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which has significantly increased threefold, from 14x in 2022 to 41x at present. This rise in investor enthusiasm was driven by the company’s enhanced financial performance, marked by strong sales growth and higher profitability. This financial change unfolded against a backdrop of a challenging market environment, particularly the inflation shock of 2022 that resulted in a substantial stock market correction. During this tumultuous period, AVGO stock saw a sharp 36% decline, dropping from its January 2022 peak of $67 to a low of $43 by October 2022. This decline was more significant compared to the S&P 500’s 25.4% peak-to-trough drop. AVGO’s recovery was gradual, only returning to its pre-crisis peak by May 2023, reflecting both the harsh market conditions and the company’s inherent resilience. Currently priced at $220, Broadcom’s stock holds a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 41, based on its trailing adjusted earnings per share of $5.36. This multiple is considered steep, and it is considerably higher than the stock’s three-year average P/E ratio of roughly 30x. Nonetheless, this premium valuation seems warranted due to the company’s substantial opportunities in the rapidly growing AI sector. These AI-driven developments are anticipated to support sales growth. While the company has demonstrated an average sales growth rate of 24% over the last three years, forecasts for the next three years expect mid-teens average growth. Notably, bottom-line growth is projected to be even more pronounced than the revenue increase. For long-term investors, any retreat in AVGO stock may signify an opportunity, considering the company’s strong fundamentals and positioning in the AI market. However, those apprehensive about near-term volatility should contemplate suitable strategies, such as the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio strategy, featuring a selection of 30 stocks, that has a history of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the previous four-year span. Why is that? As a collective, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster experience, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

May 13, 2025 09:45 ET | Source: FN Media Group LLC FN Media Group LLC PALM BEACH, Fla., May 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- FN Media Group News Commentary - The Artificial Intelligence (Al) in cybersecurity market is rapidly expanding as organizations increasingly adopt Al-driven solutions to improve threat detection, prevention, and response to evolving cyber risks. The network security segment dominated the Al in cybersecurity market expansion in 2024 due to the critical need to safeguard organizational networks from evolving cyber threats. A report from an industry insider said that: “The global AI in cybersecurity market assessment, based on type, includes network security, endpoint security, application security, and cloud security. The network security segment dominated the AI in cybersecurity market expansion in 2024 due to the critical need to safeguard organizational networks from evolving cyber threats. Securing networks against malware, phishing, and ransomware attacks has become a top priority as enterprises increasingly adopt digital transformation initiatives and cloud-based infrastructures. AI-powered network security solutions excel in real-time traffic analysis, abnormality detection, and proactive threat mitigation, ensuring robust protection of sensitive data and operational continuity. This essential role in securing core systems and communications highlights the network security segment's dominance. The global AI in cybersecurity market evaluation, based on application, includes identity & access management, risk & compliance management, data loss prevention, unified threat management, fraud detection/ anti-fraud, threat intelligence, others. The data loss prevention segment is expected to witness the fastest AI in cybersecurity market growth during the forecast period due to the rising emphasis on safeguarding sensitive and confidential information.” Active companies in cybersecurity news today include Cycurion Inc. (NASDAQ: CYCU), Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE: NET), Palo Alto Networks® (NASDAQ: PANW), Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ: AVGO), CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD). The report continued: “Organizations face heightened risks of accidental leaks or intentional data breaches with increasing volumes of data being generated and exchanged. AI-driven DLP solutions offer advanced capabilities to monitor, identify, and prevent unauthorized data transfers or exposure, ensuring compliance with strict data protection regulations such as Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDPA), California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and others. This growing need for robust data security across industries positions the DLP segment for accelerated adoption during the forecast period. North America dominated the AI in cybersecurity market revenue in 2024 due to the region's advanced technological infrastructure and high adoption of innovative security solutions. The presence of major cybersecurity companies such as IBM and AWS and early adopters of AI-driven technologies across industries such as finance, healthcare, and government especially contributed to market dominance.” Cycurion Inc. (NASDAQ:CYCU) Secures $33 Million Contract Renewal to Enhance Cybersecurity for State- Level Public Higher Education Institutions - Cycurion (“Cycurion” or the “Company”), a trusted leader in IT cybersecurity solutions and AI, announces that it has been awarded a significant contract renewal by a major state-level public higher education group. Under this renewed agreement, Cycurion will deliver comprehensive cybersecurity services to member universities and colleges within the group, ensuring they are equipped to defend their education-focused operations and digital assets against the ever-evolving landscape of cyber threats. The renewal, valued at $33 million over the five-year term, extends Cycurion’s partnership through November 2030. Comprehensive Cybersecurity Services - As part of this renewed contract, Cycurion will provide an extensive suite of cybersecurity and governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) 24x7x365 managed support services, which include: • Enterprise Security Strategy: Developing a holistic approach to security that aligns with institutional goals and protects valuable digital assets • Risk & Vulnerability Assessment & Testing: Continuous evaluation and testing of security measures to identify vulnerabilities and enhance defenses • Disaster Recovery: Strategies and solutions to restore systems and data after disruptive events • Business Continuity Planning: Ensuring ongoing operations during and after a security incident • Forensics and Recovery Services: Comprehensive support for incident investigation and data recovery • Regulatory Compliance Analysis: Assisting institutions in meeting federal and state compliance requirements “We are honored to continue serving this key state-level public higher education group customer,” said L.

(NYSE: NET), the leading connectivity cloud company, recently announced a wave of global technology companies, including Asana, Atlassian, Block, PayPal, Sentry, Stripe, and more, are working with Cloudflare to create powerful AI experiences through Anthropic’s AI assistant, Claude. These software companies are enabling Claude and other AI assistants to securely interact with their services on behalf of users, through connections built on Cloudflare Workers. Now users can complete tasks and interact with their favorite business tools through natural conversations with Claude, rather than working directly in the application. AI is already transforming the way we work by helping to edit emails, generate code, and analyze data. However, it still often requires the user to switch between multiple applications, tabs, and tools to implement the actions it recommends. For truly autonomous, agentic AI experiences, AI tools should be able to act on the user’s behalf. That can only happen if AI tools can directly interact with business software tools. MCP servers allow AI platforms to connect directly to the popular tools where data resides so the user can send an email, answer a question about a marketing campaign, or create invoices–all without leaving the AI assistant. But delivering reliable, low-latency, and secure access to external tools and data is a significant technical challenge, especially at global scale. Palo Alto Networks® (NASDAQ: PANW), the global cybersecurity leader, and the National Hockey League (NHL®) recently unveiled Cortex XSIAM® 3.0, the next evolution of its industry-leading SecOps platform, bolstered with proactive exposure management and advanced email security, enabling customers to further consolidate on Cortex for significantly better, faster and more cost-effective security operations. Three years ago, Palo Alto Networks anticipated the future of security operations by introducing Cortex XSIAM, which consolidates and normalizes all cybersecurity data to fuel advanced, real-time analytics and automation, making disjointed point products obsolete. The best-selling platform surged past $1 billion cumulative bookings in FY25 Q2, making it our fastest offering to reach this milestone. Earlier this year, Palo Alto Networks doubled down on cloud security with the introduction of Cortex Cloud, converging its industry-leading CNAPP and CDR capabilities on the unified Cortex platform. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ: AVGO) recently announced Incident Prediction, an industry-first security capability that extends Adaptive Protection, a unique feature of Symantec Endpoint Security Complete (SES-C), by leveraging AI to identify and disrupt living-off-the land (LOTL) attacks and other cyberthreats. Trained on a catalog of over 500,000 real-world attack chains built by the world-class Symantec Threat Hunter Team, Incident Prediction puts the advantage back in defenders’ hands by: predicting attackers’ behaviors, preventing their next move in the attack chain even when they’re using legitimate software, and then quickly returning the enterprise to its normal state. With Incident Prediction, SES-C delivers exceptional cyber resilience against motivated adversaries. CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD) recently released its 2025 State of SMB Cybersecurity Report, uncovering a widening gap between cybersecurity awareness and readiness among small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs). While 93% of SMBs consider themselves knowledgeable about cybersecurity risks and 83% report having a plan in place, just 36% are investing in new tools – and only 11% have adopted AI-powered defenses. Based on insights from SMB decision-makers across industries and company sizes, the research reveals that despite rising awareness, most SMBs still lack the budget, tools and in-house expertise to stop modern threats. With attacks becoming more advanced and frequent, SMBs need protection that’s easy to use, affordable to deploy and built to scale with their business.
