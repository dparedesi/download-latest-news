Title: Spot Bitcoin ETFs see $358M outflow: Are investors abandoning BTC?

Bitcoin price held above $85,000, but weakening spot ETF flows and year-end volatility tested near-term bullish sentiment. Key takeaways: Bitcoin ETF outflows and a 31% drawdown from the peak have raised doubts, but metrics indicate that institutional investors are not abandoning Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s shifting correlation with gold and steady volatility suggest price behavior remains intact despite the short-term market pressure. Bitcoin (BTC) gained 3% on Tuesday after selling off to the $85,000 level on Monday. An uptick in outflows from the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds appears to show institutional investor demand softening since the Oct. 10 crash. This has tempered near-term upside expectations without signaling a broader shift in institutional positioning The spot Bitcoin ETFs recorded $358 million in net outflows on Monday, marking the largest daily withdrawal in over three weeks. The move fueled speculation that institutional investors might be reducing their exposure after the psychological $90,000 support level was breached. More importantly, Bitcoin is currently trading 31% below its all-time high of $126,219, a pullback that could signal the end of the bullish phase that extended into October. According to X user forcethehabit, Bitcoin’s decline does not represent a trend change, as interest rate cuts have been delayed and the US Federal Reserve (Fed) has reduced its balance sheet for longer than expected. The analysis also notes that institutional capital entered primarily through ETFs and corporate reserves, while rotation into riskier and more illiquid assets has yet to materialize. Bitcoin’s correlation with gold prices can be used to assess whether the cryptocurrency is viewed as an alternative store of value or simply a proxy for higher-risk assets. The digital gold narrative has been an important driver of Bitcoin’s upside throughout 2025. How Bitcoin tracks weekly moves in the gold price is more important than its 48% underperformance relative to gold since July. The 60-day correlation metric has oscillated between positive and negative since May, indicating little consistency between Bitcoin and gold price trends. Still, there is no doubt that Bitcoin traders are disappointed by the rejection that followed the loss of the $110,000 level. While such data may appear bearish at first glance, the 31% Bitcoin price drop since October had no impact on the correlation metric. This weakens the argument that institutional investors have shifted their risk perception. Bitcoin may still succeed as an independent and decentralized financial system, even as gold remains the world’s largest store of value, with an estimated $30 trillion market capitalization. It also seems premature to conclude that institutional money has abandoned Bitcoin based solely on a 10-week correction, especially since Bitcoin has outperformed the S&P 500 index by 7% over the past 18 months. Although that difference may appear modest, Bitcoin’s options risk profile closely matches Nvidia (NVDA US) and Broadcom (AVGO US), two of the world’s eight largest companies by market value. Bitcoin options’ implied volatility peaked at 53% in November, roughly in line with the current level for Tesla (TSLA US). When traders anticipate sharp price swings, this metric rises to reflect the higher premiums charged on call (buy) and put (sell) options. Market makers tend to reduce risk exposure when surprise price moves are more likely; however, this does not necessarily mean investors have turned bearish. There is currently no indication that institutional investors have abandoned expectations for Bitcoin to reach $100,000 in the near term. Correlation and volatility metrics suggest that Bitcoin’s price behavior has not materially changed following the 30% decline, meaning a few days of ETF net outflows should not be overemphasized. The effects of the recent liquidity injection from the US Fed have yet to be reflected in markets, making it premature to judge Bitcoin’s performance.

Title: CoreWeave collapse sparks fears of cracks in AI infrastructure boom
URL: https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/12/16/coreweave-collapse-sparks-fears-of-cracks-in-ai-infrastructure-boom

Full Content:
CoreWeave (CRWV) has seen its share price fall more than 60% from its June record amid growing concerns that the AI infrastructure boom may have peaked. New details reported Tuesday by the Wall Street Journal highlight how fragile the buildout has become as operational delays collide with heavy leverage and tightening credit conditions. Investors are increasingly focused on two core risks with CRWV, according to the story. First, the company relies heavily on high interest debt to finance purchases of advanced AI chips from NVIDIA (NVDA). Second, the company depends on a small number of large customers, including OpenAI, Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META), for the majority of its revenue. Some of CoreWeave’s problems stemmed from a basic construction setback, the story continued. Heavy rainstorms in North Texas delayed concrete pours at a major data center site, pushing back delivery timelines for computing capacity. Which shows even routine infrastructure bottlenecks can disrupt trillion dollar AI investment plans. Investor confidence weakened further in late October when CoreWeave’s proposed $9 billion acquisition of Core Scientific collapsed. Core Scientific (CORZ), a former bitcoin miner turned data center landlord, rejected the deal after shareholders warned it would expose them to CoreWeave’s volatile share price and leveraged balance sheet. Shares of Oracle (ORCL) and Broadcom (AVGO) have fallen by double digit percentages in the past week after recent third quarter earnings, both companies flagging slower timing for AI related spending. The crypto and AI mining spillover has occurred as a result of new diversified revenues for bitcoin miners. IREN (IREN) and Cipher Mining (CIFR) have pivoted toward AI focused on high performance computing, signing customers including Microsoft. Each had previously surged over 500% this year, but both are down about 50% in recent weeks.. Another cause for concern, meanwhile, is that the bitcoin mining sector is increasingly relying on debt to fund expansion. CoreWeave shares have fallen a further 4% on Tuesday, trading below $70 for the first time since May.

Title: Broadcom Can’t Stop Falling. Overreaction or AI Stock Warning Sign?

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Chris Hondros / Hulton Archive via Getty Images Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) has delivered a strong performance in 2025, with shares up approximately 46% year-to-date, driven largely by demand for its artificial intelligence (AI)-related semiconductors and custom chips. The stock reached an all-time high of $414.61 per share last week. However, following the company’s fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report, its shares have declined sharply. The day after it hit its peak — which beat expectations on revenue and earnings per share — the stock fell more than 11% in a single session over concerns about gross margin pressure from a higher mix of AI revenue. Additional declines followed, with shares dropping another 5.6% yesterday, resulting in a cumulative drop of more than 17% over three trading days. Broadcom’s stock is trending lower again this morning in premarket trading. Broader concerns about AI investment returns and profitability have pressured multiple AI-related stocks in recent weeks, though Broadcom had held up better until this pullback. Shares are roughly flat over the prior month. The question for investors is, does this sharp drop indicate more downside ahead, or is it a back-up-the-truck opportunity in a company with robust long-term AI prospects? Broadcom’s ascent in 2025 stemmed primarily from explosive growth in its AI semiconductor business. Fiscal fourth-quarter AI revenue hit $6.5 billion, up 74% year-over-year, reflecting strong demand for custom AI processors and networking solutions from hyperscalers such as Google, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Anthropic, and OpenAI. The chipmaker secured major contracts, including partnerships for custom chips, that contributed to overall revenue growth of 28% in the quarter. Its infrastructure software segment — bolstered by the 2023 VMware acquisition — provided additional ssupport with recurring subscription revenue. These factors propelled the stock’s gains this year, outpacing many peers and solidifying Broadcom’s position as a key beneficiary of the AI infrastructure buildout. Yet, the sharp decline began after the earnings release. Despite beating estimates and guiding for strong first-quarter revenue, management highlighted gross margin pressure from an increase in AI revenue, which carries lower margins than some traditional segments. This sparked investor worries about near-term profitability in the AI boom. The sell-off intensified during a broader rotation out of AI-related stocks, spurred by reports of delayed data center projects and debates over returns on hyperscaler capital expenditures. Rising debt levels have also weighed on the sector. Semiconductor indexes fell significantly — the PHLX Semiconductor Sector index, comprising the 30 largest U.S.-traded semiconductor stocks, is down more than 6% — with Broadcom leading decliners on multiple days. Profit-taking after the year’s massive run also played a role, as expectations had run high heading into earnings, a classic buy-the-rumor, sell-the-news situation. Analysts, though, remain overwhelmingly positive on Broadcom’s outlook. Consensus ratings remain a Strong Buy, with an average one-year price target of $455 per share, implying 33% upside. UBS raised its target to $475 per share after the earnings report, while Trusit Financial set an industry high of $500 per share. Analysts seemed unanimous in their outlook, all reiterating buy or better ratings, citing sustained AI demand, a large backlog, and potential for accelerated growth next year. They point to Broadcom’s leadership in custom AI chips and networking as supporting further sales growth. Broadcom trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio below 25x based on fiscal 2026 estimates, with a price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 0.69 when factoring in its expected 36% long-term EPS growth. Analysts project that strong earnings expansion will be driven by AI, making Broadcom’s current valuation appear reasonable based on its growth prospects compared to its historical multiples. The chipmaker’s recent drop reflects short-term concerns over margins and AI spending worries rather than any fundamental weakness in demand. With analysts maintaining Buy ratings and lofty price targets, plus ongoing AI revenue acceleration, dips like this present buying opportunities for long-term investors focused on Broadcom’s dominant position in AI infrastructure.

Title: 5 Things to Know Before the Stock Market Opens

Stock futures are slightly lower this morning ahead of the release of highly anticipated labor market data; the government is scheduled to release two months of employment figures that were delayed owing to the government shutdown; Ford is roverhauling its electric vehicle business amid stagnant demand in the U.S.; Oracle and Broadcom are among the tech stocks looking to reverse their recent slides; and Tesla shares enter today's session at their highest level of the year. Here's what you need to know. Stock futures are ticking lower as investors await the release of two months of employment data that will provide a clearer picture about the health of the U.S. economy. Futures tied to the tech-heavy Nasdaq were off 0.3% recently, while those linked to the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.1%. On Monday, the major indexes lost ground as concerns around an AI bubble continue to pressure the tech sector. Gold futures were down 0.4% at $4,320 an ounce this morning, after approaching a fresh record high yesterday, while crude oil futures fell 1.6% to $55.90 per barrel. Bitcoin was trading at $87,100, up from an overnight low of $85,200. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which affects the costs of all sorts of consumer loans, ticked lower to 4.17%. Investors will get a double dose of jobs data on, with the government shutdown-delayed figures from October slated for released alongside November numbers at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists estimate that the October numbers will show a decline in employment owing to mass layoffs of government workers. November employment growth is expected to come in at about 50,000 jobs, a relatively modest increase that would confirm the slowdown in the labor market. The Federal Reserve last week cut its key interest rate for the third time this year, citing concerns about the labor market, and the data released today will factor into the Fed's thinking about future rate adjustments. As of Tuesday morning, the CME Group's FedWatch tracker assigns just a 24% chance of a rate cut at the Fed's Jan. 28 meeting. Ford (F) has announced a major shift in its electric vehicle strategy, with the Michigan automaker expecting to take on about $19.5 billion in one-time charges to account for the costs of its restructuring plans. Ford and other automakers are scaling back electric vehicle plans as demand in the U.S. has fallen after the Trump administration ended the $7,500 EV tax credit earlier this year. In its late-Monday announcement, Ford said its electric vehicle unit should be profitable by 2029 after making these changes, and said some of its battery-producing plants will shift to making stationary batteries for homes, businesses and data centers. The next generation of the brand's F-150 Lightning will also now be an extended range EV rather than a fully electric vehicle, and Ford said its plans to start introducing smaller, more efficient and affordable EVs continues on track for 2027. Ford shares were up 1.5% in recent premarket trading. Shares of several tech stocks are looking to recover this week after recent slides, especially Oracle (ORCL) and Broadcom (AVGO), which have each tumbled since reporting earnings last week. Analysts are largely staying bullish on the stocks, but investors worry about an AI bubble inflating valuations in the market. In the three trading sessions since last Wednesday, when Oracle reported results after the bell, shares of Oracle and Broadcom have each lost more than 15% of their value. Investors are concerned about a range of issues facing the AI trade, from questions over how companies such as Oracle and OpenAI will finance their massive expansion plans while remaining financially stable, to the sustainability of AI demand outside of the few biggest tech companies. Shares of Broadcom and Oracle were little changed ahead of the opening bell. Telsa shares come into today's session at their high point of the year and not far from an all-time high. The company is facing the same lackluster EV demand in the U.S. as other automakers, along with international sales that are being hampered by increasing competition from Chinese automakers. However, investors are increasingly focused on other aspects of Tesla's business, such as its self-driving software, robotaxis, and humanoid robots called Optimus. After piloting its robotaxi program in Austin, Texas in recent months with a Tesla employee in the passenger seat, the company has recently started testing the vehicles' ability to drive autonomously with no one in the car. Tesla shares—which closed yesterday at $475.31, just off the record closing high of $479.86 set last December—were down 0.5% in recent premarket trading.

Jefferies has some ideas about where tech investors should look after a tough stretch for the sector. Tech stocks took a hit last week, with cloud computing giant Oracle (ORCL) and chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO) at the forefront after quarterly earnings that failed to impress investors amid growing skepticism around the AI trade. But Jefferies analysts told clients amid Thursday's selloff that they still see gains for some standouts in the sector, which they identified for their "peer-leading growth" and strong fundamentals. All but one of the stocks Jefferies highlighted have already seen big gains 2025, outperforming both the S&P 500 and industry peers. Here are the analysts' ideas. Worries about an AI bubble have rattled markets in recent months, weighing on the tech sector. Some tech stocks have fared better than others, leaving many investors wondering how to pick winners from a crowded field of stocks, many which have retreated from recent highs. One of Jefferies' top picks is adtech company AppLovin (APP). Though the stock's torrid rise was wracked by short-seller allegations of sketchy practices earlier this year, it has still more than doubled in value in 2025, reaching a fresh high near $725 last week. Jefferies said it sees more gains ahead, with AppLovin expected to make a change in the first half of 2026 that would dramatically expand its business by opening up access to its referral-based advertising platform to more customers. Even among Wall Street's biggest AppLovin bulls, few are quite as bullish as Jefferies, however, with a Street-high target of $860 suggesting nearly 30% upside from Friday's close. Reddit (RDDT), Spotify (SPOT) and Roku (ROKU), which have all added over a third of their value in 2025, were among Jefferies' top picks based on hopes that new features and user experience improvements could drive higher engagement and share prices. Jefferies has a $325 target for Reddit and $135 objective for Roku, suggesting gains of about 45% and 33%, respectively. The firm's $800 target for Spotify would point to a roughly 26% rise. All three levels exceed the consensus projections of analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha. Uber (UBER) and Zillow (Z) rounded out the group. Uber, which is up some 40% year-to-date, could climb another roughly 40%, to $120, said Jefferies, with gains from robotaxi partnerships, new delivery customers, and inroads with previously underrepresented demographic groups seen helping sustain its recent momentum. Zillow, which as of Friday was down some 17% from its September highs above $90 amid worries about ongoing legal challenges, competition, and a muted housing market, finished last week less than 1% higher from where it was when the year began—then fell further today. Jefferies said it sees a full recovery for the stock and more, with a $100 target as the real estate marketplace rolls out new tools and incentives for agents.

Investing Shares of Dollar General are up another $3.80 a share in premarket. All as it continues to gap higher on strong earnings and a dividend. Sending You to Google News in 3 © ESB Professional / Shutterstock.com Shares of Dollar General (NYSE: DG) are up another $3.80 a share in premarket. All as it continues to gap higher on strong earnings and a dividend. Not only did the company just declare a 59-cent dividend (payable on January 20 to shareholders of record as of January 6), it also just earned a profit of $1.28, up 44% year over year, and 35 cents better than expected. Sales of $10.65 billion, up 4.6% year over year, beat estimates by $50 million. For fiscal year 2025, DG expects to see net sales increase by 4.7% to 4.9%, which is up from an earlier range of 4.3% to 4.8%. That translates into sales of $42.52 billion to $42.6 billion, which is above estimates of $42.49 billion. Same store sales growth is now seen jumping 2.5% to 2.7%, which is up from 2.1% to 2.6%. Fueling upside, analysts at JPMorgan just upgraded the DG stock to an overweight rating with a price target of $66. The firm is bullish on store remodels, stocking, and chain improvements. Shares of Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) are up about $5 a share in premarket. That’s after tacking on $12.09 a share on Friday. According to analysts at Barclays, vehicle deliveries are losing importance, as noted by Teslarati.com. “Even CEO Elon Musk has implied at times that the automotive side, as a whole, will only make up a small percentage of Tesla’s total valuation, as Optimus and AI begin to shine with importance,” they added. In fact, according to a Musk note on X.com, “Almost all of Tesla’s value long-term will be from AI & robots, both vehicle & humanoid…” Barclays has an equal weight holding on TSLA with a price target of $350 a share. Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) took a massive hit late last week, falling $46.44 on Friday. All after management warned of margin pressures. However, this morning, the stock is slowly regaining lost ground, gaining $3 in premarket. Helping, analysts at Morgan Stanley still expect AVGO to see strong growth moving forward. With an overweight rating on AVGO, Morgan Stanley has a $462 price target on AVGO. They also believe the latest pullback is an overreaction. Analysts at Bank of America have a $500 price target with a buy rating. Goldman Sachs has a $450 price target with a buy rating. UBS has a $472 price target with a buy rating.
