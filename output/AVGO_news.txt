Following the Federal Reserve adopting a more optimistic stance and Bitcoin hitting a historic $100,000 milestone, this week carries a handful of key earnings reports, inflation data, and some events that could set the tone for 2025. By week’s end, many will shift their focus to holiday celebrations, but for now, investors are keeping a watchful eye on developments in the stock market, eager to gauge how these signals might influence the trajectory of the markets heading into the new year. This week brings a few important earnings. On Monday, Oracle (ORCL+1.01%) Corporation will release its earnings after the closing bell, offering insights into the demand for corporate tech services. On Tuesday, GameStop (GME+9.73%) will take the spotlight with its earnings report, which is also scheduled for after the market close. Wednesday shifts focus to Adobe (ADBE+0.60%), which will reveal its financials at the end of the trading day. Thursday rounds out the week with a series of significant earnings announcements. AI giant Broadcom (AVGO+5.84%) will report its performance, offering clues about the health of the semiconductor and AI-driven technology markets. Retail powerhouse Costco (COST+0.80%) will also release its results, shedding light on consumer spending habits amid shifting economic conditions. This week, key inflation data will be released, providing important insights into the state of the U.S. economy. On Wednesday, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and core CPI data will be published, shedding light on inflationary trends and the cost of living. These reports are closely watched by economists and investors, as they help gauge the effectiveness of monetary policy. On Thursday, the market will receive initial jobless claims data, offering a snapshot of the labor market’s health, along with the Producer Price Index (PPI) and core PPI data. The PPI measures inflation at the wholesale level and provides an early indicator of potential price pressures in the broader economy. Finally, on Friday, the Import Price Index and U.S. retail sales figures will be released. The Import Price Index will highlight changes in the cost of goods imported into the U.S., while retail sales data will offer a look into consumer spending patterns, a key driver of economic growth. Microsoft (MSFT+1.39%) will determine on Tuesday whether to invest in Bitcoin, although the board has recommended voting against the proposal, citing that the company already considers a wide range of investable assets, including Bitcoin. The AI Summit kicks off in New York on Wednesday, bringing together industry leaders and innovators for two days of exploration into how artificial intelligence is transforming lives and reshaping various sectors.

Title: 5 Stock Buys And Sells From Top Billionaire Investors
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/johndobosz/2024/12/07/5-stock-buys-and-sells-from-top-billionaire-investors/
Time Published: 2024-12-07T20:21:55Z
Full Content:
Over the past 30 months, the reported moves of billionaire investors were a major consideration in the strategies we have used to construct our two Forbes Billionaire Investor model portfolios, but they were not the only factor. We also sought out stocks that had compelling value appeal with low debt levels and strong business fundamentals, which means stocks trading at depressed valuations that still produce rising revenues and profits. Except for Walt Disney (DIS), which had exceptional interest from activist billionaire investors, we’ve required our stocks to pay dividends. We also wanted to see evidence of recent insider buying among company managers and directors. The strategy has yielded great success. When we launched Forbes Billionaire Investor in September 2022, we bought large-cap future home runs like retail success stories Dick's Sporting Goods (DKS +118%) and Ross Stores (ROST +90%), as well as “Magnificent Seven” member Microsoft (MSFT +84%). Among small- and mid-caps we had F&G Annuities & Life (FG +176%), lighting specialist Acuity Brands (AYI +99%), midstream oil and gas MLP Antero Midstream (AM +97%) and mortgage insurer Radian Group (RDN +96%). Monitoring Moves Of Billionaire Investors Since 1934, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has required investment managers who exercise discretion over at least $100 million worth of assets to report their holdings on a quarterly basis via form 13F. These publicly available documents provide individual investors with a detailed look into the portfolio moves of hedge funds, private equity and other investment funds, but the information arrives with significant delays. Investment managers do not need to report their buys and sells until 45 days after the end of the financial quarter in which they were made. Especially for algorithmic and trading-oriented managers, quants like Ken Griffin of Citadel, Jeffrey Yass of Susquehanna International Group and Israel Englander of Millennium Management, if you were to buy every stock that superstar investors reported in their 13F filings, you could be buying many stocks that they have already sold. Holding periods tend to be longer for value style billionaires like Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway and David Tepper of Apaloosa Management, who seek out long-term ownership, and for activist investors like Carl Icahn who tend to hold a stock long enough to shake up management teams and companies’ boards of directors. Despite the lag times built into reporting requirements, 13F filings do provide small investors opportunities to identify areas of agreement among investment managers, and they do help you discern rising or falling ownership trends of specific managers. Moves into or out of particular sectors and industry groups become apparent, as do instances of investment conviction in single stocks. For example, Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway just reported buying a $600 million stake in Domino’s Pizza (DPZ). Buffett grabbing a slice of the Domino’s pie is one of 25 interesting insights gleaned from looking at the five biggest buys and five biggest sells of the five wealthiest self-made billionaire investors, according to Forbes. With a personal fortune of $147 billion, Buffett is by far the wealthiest, more than triple the net worth of his closest rival, Susquehanna founder Jeffrey Yass, worth nearly $50 billion. Presented below are the largest dollar-volume buys and sells of the world’s wealthiest investment managers taken from their most recent SEC filings. Timothy Archibald/The Forbes Collection From our perspective, it was most encouraging to see Berkshire initiating a $225 million stake in October’s large-cap buy, aerospace and defense supplier Heico (HEI), based in Hollywood, Fla. Buffett joins eight other billionaires in Heico, the largest stake held by Florida billionaire optometrist and inventor Herbert Wertheim, who owns 7.5% of Heico’s outstanding shares. Buffett continues to slash his ownership of Apple and Bank of America although both stocks still represent Berkshire Hathaway’s first and third largest holdings, accounting for a respective 23% and 12% of its investment portfolio. SIG Pennsylvania billionaire Jeffey Yass’ Susquehanna International Group reported selling off 69% of its Apple holdings over the past six months and still held 210,000 shares. Susquehanna also embraced a dour view of the overall market with sales of the SPDR S&P 500 and Invesco QQQ Trust ETFs. Nonetheless, QQQ is still Susquehanna’s second largest holding behind Nvidia, of which it holds 3.4 million shares, up from 2.4 million at the end of 2023. Aaron Kotowski for Forbes Through his majority ownership of financial market making firm Citadel Securities,which is valued at $22 billion,Ken Griffin would be a multi-billionaire even without his Citadel Advisors hedge fund, but it’s only because of his successful fund that he owns the equally successful securities brokerage firm business.Citadel has been taking technology sector profits in Amazon and Microsoft, as well as mobile app company AppLovin. Citadel’s biggest buy, however, was also in tech but from Australia: collaboration software maker Atlassian (TEAM). It was also an avid buyer of medical implant maker Medtronic (MDT). Daniel Shirey/MLB Photos/Getty Images The biggest buy that New York Mets owner Steven Cohen is now considering is whether he should sign superstar free agent Juan Soto to a several hundred-million dollar deal this offseason. Recently, Cohen’s Point72 hedge fund was both bullish and bearish on broadcasting. It scooped up shares of NBC owner Comcast, shares of which recently got a bump higher after the company floated plans to sell its cable networks, while unloading stock in fellow broadcast and cable stock Fox. Broadcom and Amazon are two big names that Cohen has been selling. Mark Brown/Getty Images Like Cohen, David Tepper is also a professional sports franchise owner with his majority stake in the NFL’s Carolina Panthers. The value of that stake has soared in the past two years even though the team’s on-field performance has continued to underwhelm. Tepper’s Appaloosa hedge fund has been locking in gains of several “Magnificent Seven” stocks, particularly Nvidia, Meta, Amazon and Microsoft. Despite President-elect Trump’s anti-China rhetoric the value investor’s biggest buy is from Shanghai: PDD Holdings which owns online marketplace Temu. Another recent China buy from Tepper is JD.com.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks mostly rose on Friday as investors digested the last monthly jobs report of the year, a crucial test of the prospects for interest rate cuts in December and beyond. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) lost about 0.3%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose roughly 0.3%. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) increased 0.8% as Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), and Meta (META) gained, tapping all-time intraday highs. The daily results of the major gauges also reflected their weekly performances. The Dow shed 0.6% for the week, while the S&P 500 gained close to 1%. The Nasdaq climbed more than 3%. The US economy added 227,000 jobs in November, slightly more than expected, as the labor market rebounded from October data that was dinged by severe weather and labor strikes. The unemployment rate unexpectedly ticked up to 4.2%. Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer has all the details here. The report largely matched hopes for a "Goldilocks" reading — strong enough to dampen concerns about the economy but soft enough to keep the Fed's options open on lowering rates this month and into next year. On Friday, markets were pricing in near-90% odds the Fed lowers rates by a quarter percentage point on Dec. 18, per the CME FedWatch Tool, compared with about 70% before the report. Meanwhile, the rally in bitcoin (BTC-USD) continued after slipping, trading around $101,000 Friday afternoon. Options show some investors are hedging against a deeper pullback after the leading token's record-breaking surge to over $100,000 for the first time. The rally has been spurred by hopes of support for digital currencies from President-elect Donald Trump, who on Thursday named former PayPal (PYPL) COO David Sacks as his "White House AI & Crypto Czar." On the corporate front, shares of Lululemon (LULU) and Ulta Beauty (ULTA) jumped after the retailers both boosted profit forecasts. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy US stocks mostly rose on Friday and notched gains for the week as investors took the latest monthly jobs report as a sign that the Fed will likely cut interest rates again later this month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) lost about 0.3%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose roughly 0.3%. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) increased 0.8%, with several tech giants touching new highs. The daily results of the major gauges also reflected their weekly performances. The Dow shed 0.6% for the week, while the S&P 500 gained close to 1%. The Nasdaq climbed more than 3%. If Friday's labor market reading likely kept the Federal Reserve on track to cut interest rates later this month, next week's inflation reading is perhaps the final key data point that could alter that storyline. On Wednesday, a closely watched report on US inflation will give the Federal Reserve another glimpse into consumer prices before they are set to meet for their last policy huddle of the year. If the Consumer Price Index (CPI) surprises to the upside, that might pressure central bankers to halt their interest rate cutting. But as of Friday afternoon, Wall Street largely expects the Fed to cut rates by another quarter percentage. The economic calendar also includes wholesale inventories and the import price index. A handful of major corporate names are set to deliver earnings reports next week. Among the tickers are GameStop (GME), Macy's (M), Costco (COST), and Broadcom (AVGO). Yahoo Finance's Brent Sanchez has a graphical breakdown of what to watch next week: TikTok's loss is Meta (META)'s gain. Shares of Facebook's parent company rose nearly 3% Friday afternoon following a US appeals court decision that upheld a law banning TikTok from operating in the US under Chinese ownership. The decision, which could be overturned by the Supreme Court, increases the likelihood that the short-form video app will be banned in the US. That would seriously diminish a rising competitor to American social media and digital advertising platforms. The stocks of several US tech giants rose on the news. Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), the corporate parent of Google and YouTube, gained 1%. TikTok's future isn't set, however. In addition to the legal challenges that ByteDance could pursue, there is also the unknown of what resident-elect Trump could do. As Yahoo Finance's Alexis Keenan reports, his statements on the campaign trail suggest he may at least try to tinker with the impact of the law. Here are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance’s trending tickers page during afternoon trading on Friday: Lululemon (LULU): Shares of the athletic apparel company soared Friday afternoon on the back of strong third quarter results. Lululemon raised its full-year revenue forecast after beating estimates across the top and bottom line, thanks in large part to the brand's strength in international markets. Palantir (PLTR): The big data analytics company rose more than 5% Friday after signing a new AI partnership with defense contractor Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH). Palantir is up more than 300% so far this year, riding the momentum of advancements in AI technology. Shopify (SHOP): Shares of the e-commerce platform gained 5% Friday following an upgrade from Loop Capital from a Hold to a Buy, nodding to the company's use of AI. Loop raised its price target to $140, reflecting a 23% potential upside to the stock. Ulta Beauty (ULTA): The cosmetic store chain is rallying after the company beat third quarter earnings estimates Thursday and as executives raised their forecasts for full-year earnings. Net sales for the quarter increased by 1.7% to $2.5 billion. Shares rose 10% Friday afternoon. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) shot up above $101,000 at around 1:10 p.m. ET on Friday after falling below the $100,000 milestone level. On Thursday evening President-elect Donald Trump announced venture capitalist David Sacks will be his incoming administration's "AI and crypto czar." Bitcoin reached new highs late Wednesday, surpassing $100,000 for the first time following Trump’s nomination of Paul Atkins to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission. Atkins is seen as a crypto-friendly pick for the position. The token cleared $103,000 after Trump took to his social media platform Truth Social early Thursday to cheer the recent all-time highs, telling crypto enthusiasts that they are welcome for the rally that has followed his election win last month. "CONGRATULATIONS BITCOINERS!!! $100,000!!! YOU'RE WELCOME!!!" Trump wrote. "Together, we will Make America Great Again!" A jobs report that largely matched hopes for a "Goldilocks" reading sent stocks higher in afternoon trading Friday as investors digested a crucial test of the prospects for interest rate cuts in December and beyond. Several Big Tech names also hit intraday highs, including Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), and Meta (META). The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was the outlier among the major indexes, shedding about 0.1%. But the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.2% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) increased roughly 0.6%. A US federal appeals court upheld a new law that outlaws TikTok from operating in the US under Chinese ownership, reports Yahoo Finance's Alexis Keenan. The plan could still be altered by the Supreme Court or affected by President-elect Donald Trump, who in September suggested in a social media post that he would "save TikTok" and prevent federal law enforcement from shuttering the app. The law, called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (PAFACAA), gives TikTok’s Chinese owner, ByteDance, an ultimatum to either sell TikTok to a US owner by Jan. 19, 2025, or have it banned from operations in the country. TikTok challenged the law by arguing it violated the US Constitution in taking away the First Amendment rights of TikTok's US entity and its users. But a panel of three judges from the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit concluded that the government's law withstood constitutional scrutiny by protecting free speech in the US "from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary's ability to gather data on people in the United States." Read about the latest on the government's effort to ban TikTok under Chinese ownership here. A labor market rebound announced Friday is likely to keep the Federal Reserve on track to cut interest rates by another quarter percentage point later this month, absent any upside surprises to inflation, reports Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger. "For the Fed, this doesn't change the narrative," Robert Sockin, Citigroup's senior chief economist, told Yahoo Finance. The new jobs numbers are "right in the spot of what they were looking for and they are comfortable with to continue easing policy" at the last meeting of the year, on Dec. 17-18. Traders boosted the odds of a rate cut at that meeting to 91% following the data release. But Fed watchers agreed that the robust jobs picture and recent stickiness in inflation reinforce a mounting conviction that the pace of rate cuts in 2025 will be less aggressive than once expected. Read about how the latest labor market readings will steer the Federal Reserve's next policy decision here. Consumers are growing more concerned about the path forward for inflation over the next year. The latest consumer sentiment survey from the University of Michigan revealed that consumers expect inflation to hit 2.9% in a year, an increase from last month's expectation of 2.6%. December's reading is the highest in six months but within the 2.3% to 3% range seen in the two years before the pandemic. Expectations for long-run inflation slipped higher, though, falling to 3.1% from 3.2% the month prior. The overall consumer sentiment index popped to a reading of 74, up from 71.8 in November. Overall, consumer views on inflation varied based on political party, Surveys of Consumers Director Joanne Hsu noted. "Democrats voiced concerns that anticipated policy changes, particularly tariff hikes, would lead to a resurgence in inflation," Hsu said in the release. "Republicans disagreed; they expect the next president will usher in an immense slowdown in inflation." Also in this month's data, the survey showed a large increase in buying conditions for durable goods, which boosted current economic conditions by more than 20%. "Rather than a sign of strength, this rise in durables was primarily due to a perception that purchasing durables now would enable buyers to avoid future price increases," Hsu said. A jobs report that largely matched hopes for a "Goldilocks" reading sent stocks higher as investors digested a crucial test of the prospects for interest rate cuts in December and beyond. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained about 0.3% and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.2% after the gauges drifted away from all-time highs at Thursday's close. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) increased roughly 0.3%. The US economy added 227,000 jobs in November, slightly more than expected, as the labor market rebounded from October data that was dinged by severe weather and labor strikes. The unemployment rate unexpectedly ticked up to 4.2%. The US labor market rebounded from an October swoon, adding more jobs than expected in November, while the unemployment rate ticked higher to 4.2%.
