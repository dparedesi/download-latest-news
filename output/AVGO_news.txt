Title: Amid AI-Fueled Growth, AVGO Stock's Valuation Raises Concern

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CANADA - 2025/01/06: In this photo illustration, the Broadcom company logo is seen displayed on a ... More smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) announced robust results for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 (ending in October), exceeding consensus estimates for both revenue and earnings. The company reported $15.0 billion in revenue, a 20% year-over-year increase, and adjusted earnings of $1.58 per share, up 44% year-over-year. These figures slightly surpassed analyst expectations of $14.97 billion and $1.57, respectively. This growth was primarily fueled by strong demand for Broadcom’s AI semiconductor solutions and contributions from VMware. AI revenue alone surged by 46% year-over-year to over $4.4 billion in Q2, driven by robust demand for AI networking. Alongside impressive sales growth, the company’s adjusted EBITDA margin significantly expanded by 700 basis points year-over-year, reaching 66.7% in Q2. Broadcom’s outlook for Q3 also appears promising, with anticipated sales of $15.8 billion, slightly ahead of the $15.7 billion consensus. The company expects growth in AI semiconductor revenue to accelerate to $5.1 billion in Q3, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of at least 66%. Despite these solid results, AVGO stock saw a 4% decline in after-market trading on Thursday, June 5. This dip can partly be attributed to the stock's already high valuation. The question for investors is whether to buy AVGO stock at its current price of around $250. This is a tricky decision. While the stock appears attractive, its high valuation makes it particularly susceptible to adverse events, leading to potential volatility. Our analysis, which compares AVGO’s current valuation to its recent operating performance and financial health, suggests minimal underlying concerns. Broadcom exhibits a very strong operating performance and financial condition across key parameters, including growth, profitability, financial stability, and downturn resilience. However, if you seek upside with less volatility than a single stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception. Separately, see – Is Amazon Stock Still A Buy After Its Recent 25% Rally? Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, AVGO stock looks very expensive compared to the broader market. Broadcom’s Revenues have grown considerably over recent years. Broadcom’s profit margins are much higher than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. Broadcom's balance sheet looks strong. AVGO stock has fared worse than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy, how bad can things get if there is another recession? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes. In summary, Broadcom’s performance across the parameters detailed above is as follows: - Growth: Extremely Strong - Profitability: Very Strong - Financial Stability: Strong - Downturn Resilience: Neutral - Overall: Strong Even though the stock has performed strongly in the parameters discussed, its extremely high valuation supports our conclusion that AVGO is a tricky stock to buy. We think investors would likely be better off waiting for a further dip before picking AVGO stock. Notably, the average analyst price estimate of $254 also suggests that the stock does not have significant room for growth. Of course, we could be wrong, and investors may continue to assign even higher valuation multiples to AVGO stock given its position in the AI boom. Sometimes, valuations take a back seat when investors get eager about the outlook. In fact, evaluating valuation contextually is just one of many approaches we take when constructing the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio. This portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last four years. This is because, as a group, HQ Portfolio stocks have provided better returns with less risk compared to the benchmark index, offering a less volatile investment experience, as evident in the HQ Portfolio's performance metrics.

Business A smartphone with a displayed Broadcom logo is placed on a computer motherboard in this illustration taken March 6, 2023. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo Broadcom shares fell more than 3 per cent in early trading on Friday, after the company's third-quarter revenue forecast failed to impress investors who have been extremely bullish on chip stocks amid an artificial intelligence boom. The Palo Alto, California-based company, which supplies semiconductors to Apple and Samsung, provides advanced networking gear that allows vast amounts of data to travel across AI data centers, making its chips crucial for the development of generative AI technology. Broadcom forecast third-quarter revenue of around $15.80 billion, compared with analysts' average estimate of $15.71 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. SUQIAN, CHINA - MARCH 9, 2025 - An illustration photo shows the Broadcom LOGO displayed on a ... More smartphone in Suqian, Jiangsu province, China on March 9, 2025. (Photo credit should read CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images) Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is scheduled to report its earnings on Thursday, June 5, 2025. Historically, AVGO stock has often seen a positive reaction to its earnings announcements. Over the past five years, the stock has posted positive one-day returns in a strong 80% of instances, with a median gain of 2.9% and a maximum one-day jump of 24.4%. While actual results will heavily influence stock performance, understanding these historical patterns can give event-driven traders an edge. Here are two main approaches: Analysts project Broadcom to report earnings of $1.57 per share on sales of $14.97 billion. This marks a significant improvement from the prior year’s quarter, which saw earnings of $1.10 per share on sales of $12.49 billion. This anticipated growth is expected to be fueled by the continued expansion of Broadcom’s AI-related custom chips and Ethernet products. Investors will also be closely watching trends in custom ASIC sales. From a fundamental standpoint, Broadcom currently boasts a market capitalization of $1.1 trillion. Over the last twelve months, the company generated $55 billion in revenue and was operationally profitable, with $19 billion in operating profits and a net income of $10 billion. That said, if you seek upside with lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio presents an alternative - having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Separately, see – Merck Stock’s Ticking Keytruda Time Bomb.See earnings reaction history of all stocks Some observations on one-day (1D) post-earnings returns: Additional data for observed 5-Day (5D), and 21-Day (21D) returns post earnings are summarized along with the statistics in the table below. AVGO 1D, 5D, and 21D Post Earnings Return A relatively less risky strategy (though not useful if the correlation is low) is to understand the correlation between short-term and medium-term returns post earnings, find a pair that has the highest correlation, and execute the appropriate trade. For example, if 1D and 5D show the highest correlation, a trader can position themselves "long" for the next 5 days if 1D post-earnings return is positive. Here is some correlation data based on 5-year and 3-year (more recent) history. Note that the correlation 1D_5D refers to the correlation between 1D post-earnings returns and subsequent 5D returns. AVGO Correlation Between 1D, 5D and 21D Historical Returns Sometimes, peer performance can have influence on post-earnings stock reaction. In fact, the pricing-in might begin before the earnings are announced. Here is some historical data on the past post-earnings performance of Broadcom stock compared with the stock performance of peers that reported earnings just before Broadcom. For fair comparison, peer stock returns also represent post-earnings one-day (1D) returns. AVGO Correlation With Peer Earnings Learn more about Trefis RV strategy that has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of all 3, the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000), to produce strong returns for investors. Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock like Broadcom, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception.

Title: The Magnificent Seven Stocks Staged a Blistering May Rally. What's Next?
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/the-magnificent-seven-stocks-staged-a-blistering-may-rally-what-s-next-11746644
Time Published: 2025-06-02T19:12:00Z
Full Content:
The Magnificent Seven had a strong May, but the group remains in the red for 2025. What's next? Taken together, the seven big tech stocks—names like Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), Meta Platforms (META) and more—outperformed dozens of other assets tracked by Deutsche Bank analyst Henry Allen last month. The group saw their stocks rise more than 13% in aggregate in May, their biggest monthly gain in 2 years, according to Allen. Nonetheless, the group remains one of the few corners of global markets lower since the start of the year. Of 32 different sets of investments tracked by Allen—including global equity indexes, government and corporate bonds, foreign exchange indexes, and commodities—only one other asset, crude oil, is negative for the year. Whether the Mag Seven can climb into positive territory this month could depend on what Wall Street thinks of a few upcoming corporate events. Apple (AAPL) will host its Worldwide Developers Conference on June 9. The iPhone maker is expected to unveil a software development kit that helps outside developers build features with Apple Intelligence’s underlying large language models. That would effectively let Apple outsource some of the work of building AI products for its devices, which could help close the perceived gap in AI capabilities between it and major peers. And around the middle of the month, Tesla (TSLA) is expected to roll out its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, in what could be a major test of the company’s autonomous vehicle ambitions. Apple and Tesla are the worst-performing stocks in the Mag Seven so far this year, with their shares down about 20% and 16%, respectively. Investor enthusiasm about the companies' progress in some emerging areas seen as vital could help lift their shares. Bank of America analysts on Monday upgraded the information technology sector—home to Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia, and Broadcom (AVGO), the latter a non-Magnificent stock—to neutral from underweight, and downgraded communications services—including Alphabet (GOOG) and Meta—to underweight from neutral. They cited active funds’ historically low exposure to IT and high exposure to communications, as well as the communications and media industry’s comparatively unpredictable revenue streams. Perceived recession risks have decreased in the last month thanks to easing tensions between the U.S. and China. Lately, though each side has accused the other in recent days of violating the terms of their agreement, demonstrating the fragility of their detente. The Mag Seven’s communications companies, Alphabet and Meta, likely have the most recession-proof ad businesses on the internet thanks to the sheer size of their audiences. Yet the tech giants face another risk, according to BofA analysts: Tech companies, they say, addressed elevated interest rates in 2023 by effectively “shortening duration”—they cut costs, reduced capital expenditures, and increased their cash returns. Today, Alphabet and Meta are locked in an all-out AI arms race, spending tens of billions of dollars a year on AI infrastructure. That spending could tie the companies’ hands in the event of a slowdown. Another risk for tech stocks is their price tag, according to BofA. Valuations have declined from their recent highs, but the stocks are still expensive—the Mag Seven's P/E ratio of 33.1 is well above the S&P 500's long-term average—and earnings expectations remain elevated.
