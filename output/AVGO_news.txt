(Photo by Abdullah Guclu/Anadolu via Getty Images) See More On Trefis.com Broadcom stock (NASDAQ:AVGO) experienced a 7% decline on Thursday, February 27th, as part of a broader selloff affecting chip stocks. This market reaction followed the release of Nvidia’s earnings report and President Trump’s announcement of increased tariffs on China, as well as the imposition of tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, set to take effect next week. Separately, Should You Buy Monster Beverage Stock At $55? After its recent fall, AVGO stock looks attractive but volatile - making it a tricky pick to buy at its current price of around $200. We believe there is minimal cause for concern with AVGO stock, which makes it attractive but highly sensitive to adverse events as its current valuation is extremely high. We arrive at our conclusion by comparing the current valuation of AVGO stock with its operating performance over the recent years as well as its current and historical financial condition. Our analysis of Broadcom along key parameters of Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience shows that the company has a very strong operating performance and financial condition, as detailed below. Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, AVGO stock looks very expensive compared to the broader market. • Broadcom has a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 20.1 vs. a figure of 3.1 for the S&P 500 • Additionally, the company's price-to-operating income (P/EBIT) ratio is 69.0 compared to 24.4 for S&P 500 • And, it has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 51.9 vs. the benchmark’s 24.4 Broadcom's Revenues have grown considerably over recent years. • Broadcom has seen its top line grow at an average rate of 24.3% over the last 3 years (vs. 9.8% for S&P 500) • Its revenues have grown 44.0% from $36 Bil to $52 Bil in the last 12 months (vs. change of 5.6% for S&P 500) • Also, its quarterly revenues grew 51.2% to $14 Bil in the most recent quarter from $9.3 Bil a year ago (vs. 7.2% change for S&P 500) Broadcom's profit margins are much higher than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. • Broadcom's Operating Income over the last four quarters was $15 Bil, which represents a high Operating Margin of 29.1% (vs. 12.6% for S&P 500) • Broadcom’s Operating Cash Flow (OCF) over this period was $20 Bil, pointing to a high OCF-to-Sales Ratio of 38.7% (vs. 14.4% for S&P 500) Broadcom's balance sheet looks strong. • Broadcom's Debt figure was $68 Bil at the end of the most recent quarter, while its market capitalization is $925 Bil (as of 2/27/2025). This implies a strong Debt-to-Equity Ratio of 6.5% (vs. 19.7% for S&P 500). [Note: A lower Debt-to-Equity Ratio is desirable] • Cash (including cash equivalents) makes up $9 billion of the $166 billion in Total Assets for Broadcom. This yields a moderate Cash-to-Assets Ratio of 5.6% (vs. 14.1% for S&P 500) AVGO stock has been more resilient than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy, how bad can things get if there is another recession? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes. • AVGO stock fell 34.8% from a high of $62.71 on 4 January 2022 to $40.86 on 16 October 2022, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 17 May 2023 • Since then, the stock has increased to a high of $249.33 on 16 December 2024 and currently trades at around $200 • AVGO stock fell 46.8% from a high of $27.40 on 19 February 2020 to $14.57 on 18 March 2020, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 5 June 2020 In summary, Broadcom's performance across the parameters detailed above are as follows: • Growth: Extremely Strong • Profitability: Very Strong • Financial Stability: Strong • Downturn Resilience: Strong • Overall: Very Strong Hence, despite its extremely high valuation, the stock appears attractive but volatile, which supports our conclusion that AVGO is a tricky stock to buy. Not too happy about the volatile nature of AVGO stock? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Nvidia's strong earnings can't keep its stock from sliding — along with other chipmakers

Nvidia (NVDA+1.66%) and other semiconductor stocks gave up premarket gains and fell in early Thursday Wall Street trading. While the AI chipmaker yesterday posted earnings that surpassed fourth-quarter estimates with robust guidance, they may have fallen short of the complete blowout that some investors had anticipated. Rival chipmakers Advanced Micro Devices (AMD+0.16%), Micron (MU+1.00%), Broadcom (AVGO+0.12%), and Intel (INTC+2.40%) also declined, shedding pre-opening gains. “This is telling you more about the state/sentiment of the market, and [its] volatile nature ... than it tells you about how Nvidia is doing in our eyes,” Mahoney Asset Management CEO Ken Mahoney said before the open. “These results mean a lot for the stock market and the AI ecosystem.” Nvidia’s strong order book for its newest models is an indication that its customers are continuing to invest in artificial intelligence, and may lay to rest concerns that DeepSeek’s recently unveiled, cheaper AI model has prompted companies to defer or reduce their spending plans. “CEO commentary suggests Blackwell demand is ‘amazing,’ supported by strong top-line results,” Gabelli Funds’ John Belton said. “It should be a positive read for AI demand and the investment cycle.” Elsewhere, TSMC (TSM-1.62%) stock fell in Taipei on Thursday. Taiwan Economy Minister Kuo Jyh-huei said the chip foundry would need government permission for any overseas joint venture, but there are no restrictions on making the most-advanced chips overseas other than for China, Reuters reported. The Trump administration has pushed to have TSMC buy Intel’s chipmaking operations or at least operate them as a joint venture. The Taiwanese firm isn’t actually interested, and even the threat of tariffs probably won’t be enough to force a deal. The nation continues to negotiate with the U.S. to seek the best conditions possible for Taiwanese companies under possible new American tariffs, Kuo told the news agency. —Britney Nguyen contributed to this article.
