We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Barclays analysts gave a review of the chip industry and talked about Nvidia's (NVDA, Financials) Blackwell ramp, Apple's (AAPL, Financials) plans to cut iPhone production, and wider market trends, after undertaking a trip to Asia. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with NVDA. According to analyst Tom O'Malley, now roughly 50% of Nvidia's Blackwell ramp is used, and over the next few quarters it is expected to rise to 80%. With this degree of use, Nvidia's income in the January quarter may be about $6 billion. By April, the company's manufacturing capability is planned to double to 40,000 wafers monthly. By contrast, during the third quarter its Hopper products reached 600,000 units monthly manufacturing volume. Although Blackwell-Ultra solutions are not yet included into the supply chain, O'Malley pointed out that they should increase with the launch of single-die solutions early next year. While manufacture of the TPU v5 chips is likely to stall between January and April, resulting in a brief drop in numbers before a major rise in July, Google's (GOOG, Financials) TPU v6 chips are scheduled to join the supply chain by late Q2 2025. Manufacturers of application-specific integrated circuits are aiming for the 3-nanometer node in 2026 in advanced chip fabrication. O'Malley said, nevertheless, that businesses like Broadcom (AVGO, Financials) and Marvell (MRVL, Financials) are not expected to lose market share. While AMD's (AMD, Financials) AI accelerator productsthe MI300 and 325saw a rise in orders in the fourth quarter but are likely to show a sequential drop in the first quarter of 2025. Early data for AMD's Xilinx subsidiary shows double-digit year-over-year growth, but momentum may slow early next year. Premium flagship Android smartphones are doing very well in the smartphone market, which helps Qualcomm (QCOM, Financials). Although Qualcomm is also gaining from aggressive pricing in the low-end market, the company's Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 chip has proven success in fetching premium price. O'Malley also said that as Samsung Electronics (SSNLF, Financials) struggles with its own 3-nanometer ramp, Qualcomm is probably securing 100% of the Samsung Galaxy S25 CPU supply. Mid-tier smartphone weakness is predicted to affect vendors like Skyworks Solutions (SWKS, Financials) and Qorvo (QRVO, Financials). O'Malley noted conflicting indications about Apple iPhone manufacturing, with recent figures indicating a possible 10% to 15% drop in unit output for the March quarter. Featuring an Apple modem, the iPhone SE is scheduled for a late Q1 release and volumes are estimated to reach 25 million devices. O'Malley said in the memory industry that although NAND demand is still sluggish, demand for DRAM is promising; mid-to-high teens increase projected in 2025. While demand for high-bandwidth memory is surpassing previous estimates, supply limitations might help to stabilize costs. O'Malley predicts that capital expenditures for 2025 will stay flat; Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM, Financials) is focusing on moving manufacturing nodes from N5 to N3. Samsung's capacity to scale is being limited by its difficulties with 3-nanometer yields as well. With less development than expected by market forecasts, Barclays anticipates wafer fab equipment investment to reflect these constraints. Based on Barclays' research, the semiconductor sector shows mixed development possibilities with variances across businesses and sectors. This article first appeared on GuruFocus.

Broadcom launches VMware Tanzu Platform 10, simplifying private cloud app development with reduced costs, enhanced security, and GenAI support for enterprises. Overview Broadcom Inc. (NYSE: AVGO) has introduced VMware Tanzu Platform 10, a cutting-edge solution to streamline private cloud application development. With its release, businesses can now create and deploy applications—ranging from standard business apps to next-generation AI applications—faster, more securely, and cost-effectively. Key Features of Tanzu Platform 10 Optimized Infrastructure Costs: Tanzu Platform 10 reduces the infrastructure needed for Cloud Foundry foundations by up to 70%. For instance, the number of virtual machines required for a new deployment has dropped from 13 to just 4, saving costs and simplifying scaling for distributed applications. Enhanced Security with Plug-and-Play FIPS Libraries: Developers can integrate Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS)-approved libraries into their apps, ensuring compliance with stringent security standards. For example, apps using these libraries can self-check for compliance and alert administrators in real time if issues arise. Improved App Visibility and Resiliency: Organizations can now monitor applications across multiple regions and zones through a unified dashboard, helping teams quickly identify and address performance issues. Built-in runbooks, for instance, provide actionable recommendations to fix problems faster. Support for GenAI Applications: Tanzu Platform 10 integrates AI-friendly tools, allowing developers to build and scale AI-powered apps seamlessly. For example, by utilizing VMware Private AI Foundation, organizations can host AI models on GPU infrastructure for enhanced privacy and performance. Real-World Applications Financial Services: Banks can deploy large-scale applications across multiple regions while maintaining high security and governance. Retail: Businesses can create intelligent customer service chatbots powered by GenAI while reducing infrastructure costs. Government Agencies: Secure and compliant deployments are made easier with built-in governance tools and FIPS libraries. Kubernetes Made Simple One of Tanzu Platform 10's standout features is its ability to bring the simplicity of Cloud Foundry’s “cf-push” developer experience to Kubernetes. Developers, even those new to Kubernetes, can now deploy applications without worrying about its underlying complexities. For example A retail company can use Tanzu Platform 10 to deploy Kubernetes-based e-commerce applications without needing a team of Kubernetes experts. Advanced-Data Services The platform also introduces powerful data management tools, such as pre-configured high-availability setups for databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL.
