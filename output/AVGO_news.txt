Title: The Shutdown Is Over. Winter Is Usually Good For Stocks. Here's Why Investors Are Selling.

The stock market cleared a major hurdle this week. It's the outset of what is historically a good time for equities. You wouldn't know it if you looked at your portfolio today. President Donald Trump on Wednesday signed legislation to reopen the federal government, ending the longest shutdown in U.S. history. The reopening removes the economic drag from more than 1 million federal workers going without pay and clears a path for federal agencies to once again release vital economic data. Yet stocks were falling Thursday, led by the tech-heavy Nasdaq, which finished the day down more than 2%—perhaps a “buy the rumor, sell the news” event, since stocks rallied on Monday as an end to the shutdown looked imminent. AI optimism and expectations for rate cuts have been two of the primary drivers of stock returns this year. If either AI or the Federal Reserve fail to meet Wall Street's expectations, stocks may be vulnerable to correction. Historically, the end of a shutdown has supported stocks, according to Adam Turnquist, Chief Technical Strategist at LPL Financial. Since 1976, he wrote Wednesday, covering 20 shutdowns, the S&P 500 has risen more in the one- and three-month periods after a budget resolution than in all other comparable periods. This shutdown is also ending at a time of year that’s historically good for the stock market. Since 2000, November has, on average, been the best month of the year for the S&P 500. December, another positive month, is more often than not capped off with a Santa Claus rally. But the mood on Wall Street heading into the end of the year appears more dour than rosy, with investors debating the existence of an AI bubble and uncertain what incoming economic data will say about the health of the economy. The debate about an AI bubble has taken a toll on tech stocks in recent weeks. Shares of chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) slid 7% last week, and were down more than 3.5% on Thursday. Palantir (PLTR) stock tumbled 8% the day after it posted earnings that blew past estimates and raised its full-year guidance. On Thursday, the majority of the S&P 500’s worst-performing stocks were high-flying AI beneficiaries like software firm Applovin (APP) and chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO). AI bubble concerns are being fueled by soaring valuations in both public and private markets. OpenAI, which doesn't expect to turn a profit until 2029, is valued at $500 billion. Palantir, even with its recent pullback, trades at about 240 times forward earnings. The chasm between AI spending and AI revenue has also raised eyebrows. Hyperscalers Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Oracle (ORCL) intend to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to build data centers and fill them with AI-enabling equipment. They have had some success showing investors that AI is contributing to their top and bottom lines, but some investors are turning skeptical. Wall Street has also taken note of a shift in how AI investments are funded. Up to this point, tech giants like Microsoft and Amazon have mostly relied on cash flows to build data centers and buy chips. Proponents of the AI bubble narrative have frequently pointed to the size and stability of these cash flows to argue for the AI boom’s sustainability. Investors will also be watching economic data heading into the Federal Reserve’s last policy meeting of the year next month. Inflation and labor market reports were delayed by the shutdown, denying Wall Street and the Fed vital economic temperature checks. And, despite the end of the shutdown, investors aren’t sure when they’ll get that data, if at all. The White House on Wednesday suggested inflation and labor market data for October may never be released, which would leave policymakers to lean on other public and private datasets as they deliberate whether to cut interest rates for a third time this year in mid-December. Officials are divided on how to proceed. Some have urged caution, citing concerns that inflation, which has reaccelerated this year, could stick above their 2% target. The data blackout has given inflation-wary officials even more reason to argue for slower cuts. Meanwhile, recent private sector data suggests that labor market conditions have deteriorated more than expected this year, giving dovish officials fodder to argue for more aggressive cuts. Wall Street increasingly believes the hawks, who favor higher rates, have the upper hand. Federal funds futures trading data on Thursday put the odds of a December rate cut at 47%, down from 96% a month ago and 63% yesterday.

Title: Nancy Pelosi Is Retiring up 595%, but She’s Still Holding on to These 3 Stocks

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Drew Angerer / Getty Images News via Getty Images Nancy Pelosi announced her retirement last week. She has been a leading voice in Congress for decades, and her term will end in January 2027. She’s currently holding on to many stocks, with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) being the latest buys. Pelosi hasn’t been without controversy, with stock trading being one of the biggest concerns of her critics. It should be noted that Nancy Pelosi’s stock trades are not directly hers. Her husband, Paul Pelosi, is the person buying and selling stocks, though these trades are still attributed to her, as she is likely legally entitled to a significant portion of them, upon a possible divorce or her husband’s passing. At the same time, there are concerns that Nancy Pelosi will be passing information to her husband. These claims are not proven. But what is proven is that the Pelosis have had remarkable wins over the course of their investing history. Since mid-2014, her strategy has yielded her 858.58% in gains, whereas the S&P 500 only returned 263.2%. This is a 595% outperformance over the S&P 500. Let’s take a look at the three stocks she holds now. Nvidia is Pelosi’s biggest holding, with 20% of her portfolio being in this one stock. Her latest trade was on January 14, 2025, and was disclosed on January 17. She purchased 50 call options with a strike price of $80 and an expiration date of January 16, 2026. Since that trade, NVDA stock is up 47.09%. If the options were to be exercised today, she would have a total of $569,000 in NVDA stock. To find the true profits, you’d have to exclude the premium paid for all these options, the exact amount of which is not known. Alphabet is her second-biggest holding, with 15% of her portfolio in GOOGL stock. Her latest transaction was on January 14, 2025, and was filed three days later on January 17. She bought 50 call options on GOOGL stock, with each option representing 100 shares. This has been a very profitable buy, with GOOGL stock up more than 46% since that transaction took place. Since these are options, Pelosi will be able to exercise 5,000 shares of GOOGL at the strike price of $150. If these options were to be exercised today, she would have $683,550 in GOOGL stock. This is a well-timed trade, and Pelosi is very likely to exercise these options by the time they expire and then hold GOOGL stock directly. Broadcom also has the same weight as Alphabet at 15%. Her most recent AVGO trade happened on June 20, 2025, and it was disclosed on July 9. She exercised 20 call options that were purchased on June 24, 2024 (20,000 shares post-split). President Donald Trump announced a $70 billion investment in AI and energy, less than a month after Pelosi exercised those options. AVGO stock is up 42.09% since the call options were exercised, but her initial call options trade made even more money. Pelosi bought 20 call options on AVGO with an $800 strike price and an expiry of June 20, 2025. This was three weeks before AVGO went through a 10-for-1 stock split. AVGO stock gained over 50% from June 24, 2024, to June 20, 2025.

Title: Nvidia's Earnings Are Almost Here. Investors Are Already Worried About the AI Rally.

Nvidia is slated to report quarterly results next Wednesday. It could be a make-or-break moment for the bull market. Anxiety about AI is running high on Wall Street heading into Nvidia's (NVDA) print. AI stocks weighed on the broader market last week, when the Nasdaq notched its worst weekly performance since early April’s “Liberation Day” tariff announcement roiled markets. The mood improved to start the week amid signs that the government was moving closer to reopening. But AI jitters returned after Japanese investment firm SoftBank on Tuesday said it had sold its entire stake in Nvidia: Shares of both companies slumped despite SoftBank executives clarifying that the sale was made to fund other AI investments, not a sign that the company had soured on the chipmaker. Nvidia's quarterly earnings report is one of the most closely followed events on Wall Street. Investors parse Nvidia's results and guidance for confirmation that the AI infrastructure buildout, which made the chipmaker the world's most valuable company and has help power partners' and competitors' shares higher, is continuing. Some investors are increasingly concerned that an AI bubble is forming, fueled by a series of circular business deals, massive AI investments, and optimism about the technology’s near-term commercial utility. Michael Burry, known for predicting the 2007 subprime mortgage crisis, recently revealed his hedge fund had shorted $1.2 billion of Nvidia and Palantir (PLTR) stock as of the end of September. The major hyperscalers—tech giants like Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Oracle (ORCL)—plan to spend hundreds of billions of dollars this year and next as they construct data centers and outfit them with the advanced chips and support equipment required the train and run artificial intelligence. That spending has been a boon to companies like Nvidia, whose sales and earnings have soared over the past three years. But some investors question whether the hyperscalers would recoup their investments. BCA Research analysts last week suggested shorting hyperscaler stocks, citing their belief that the speed and scale of AI investments will weigh the companies' returns on equity, and thus their stock valuations, regardless of profit growth in their core businesses. “Our biggest fear would be a repeat of the telecom and fiber buildout experiences, where the revenue curve failed to materialize at a pace that justified continued investment,” wrote JPMorgan analysts on Wednesday. JPMorgan estimated that it would require about $650 billion of annual revenue indefinitely for tech companies to reap a 10% return on their AI investments through 2030. For scale, they likened that figure to nearly six basis points of global gross domestic product or nearly $35 a month from every current iPhone user. The growing importance of OpenAI to the rally has also raised eyebrows. According to CEO Sam Altman, the start-up recently reached an annualized revenue run rate of $20 billion. But JPMorgan estimates the ChatGPT maker has agreed to pay just three companies—Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Broadcom (AVGO)—between $1.2 trillion and $1.5 trillion for data center capacity over the next 5 years. To be sure, many investors see ample reason to remain bullish on AI stocks—or, at least, that it's too hard to call the top to bet against them. They note that comparisons of today to the Dotcom Bubble ignore that tech valuations are below their Dotcom peaks, and that, unlike during the 1990s internet craze, the companies making the biggest investments in AI infrastructure are among the world's largest most profitable companies. Others point to the likelihood that the Federal Reserve is in the middle of a rate-cutting cycle, which should stimulate data center construction by making borrowing more affordable. Rate cuts are also expected to increase liquidity in financial markets, likely boosting stock prices. AI excitement can still send a stock soaring despite the skeptics. Chipmaker AMD on Tuesday said it expects the AI chip market to reach $1 trillion by 2030, and that it is aiming to grow its share of that market to double digits. Oppenheimer analysts in a note on Wednesday called the updates "more sizzle than steak," and lamented the absence of a major customer announcement. Still, the projections caught the attention of investors. AMD shares finished today up more than 8%.

November 12, 2025 03:01 ET | Source: Broadcom Inc. Broadcom Inc. New ODM Self-Certification Program, Open Networking Initiative, and Open Source Software Contributions Fuel Flexible, Adaptable Private Clouds New and Expanded Collaborations Announced with Cisco, Intel, OVHcloud, SNUC and Supermicro PALO ALTO, Calif., Nov. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Today, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ: AVGO) announced it is advancing an open, extensible ecosystem for VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF), enabling customers to build, connect, protect, and extend their modern private clouds. With these announcements, Broadcom is delivering a private cloud platform that is open and adaptable across all infrastructure layers. Customers will have increased ability to leverage their preferred data center and edge hardware infrastructure, open networking constructs, and open source technologies for on-prem and hosted private cloud environments, while VCF partners will have more opportunity for innovation. “The momentum behind VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0 is undeniable. It's a platform that's redefining how organizations approach their private cloud journey, offering a consistent operating model that spans data centers to the edge,” said Paul Turner, Chief Product Officer, VMware Cloud Foundation Division, Broadcom. “By fostering an open VCF ecosystem, we're empowering businesses to build modern private clouds that align with their strategic needs, ensuring they can leverage the technologies required for their unique environments.” Open Hardware Ecosystem Enables Flexibility and Choice for Modern Private Cloud DeploymentsBroadcom is expanding its open hardware certification program to increase Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) and Original Design Manufacturer (ODM) participation through new VCF AI ReadyNodes, ODM self-service certification, and support for new edge systems. “Supermicro is excited to be among the first hardware OEMs to certify our industry-leading GPU systems as VCF AI ReadyNodes,” said Ismail Sayeeduddin, Vice President, Business Development, Supermicro. “This milestone gives customers a clear migration path from previously certified Supermicro systems in the VMware certification program to the latest fully validated and optimized GPU solutions that help eliminate the cost and complexity of AI adoption.” “Broadcom's open certification program for VCF Ready hardware supports our vertical integration strategy, enabling us to self-certify our server systems for VMware Cloud Foundation,” said Yaniv Fdida, chief product and technology officer for OVHcloud. “This will reinforce our commitment to deliver our customers with competitive, high-performance private cloud services that remain cost-effective. Broadcom’s program will help accelerate our time-to-market for innovative and secure cloud solutions powered by VMware technology, further solidifying our position as a leading global cloud player.” “Broadcom's expansion of the ReadyNode certification program accelerates the deployment of VMware Cloud Foundation 9.0 on Intel Xeon 6 platforms,” said Caitlin Anderson, Corporate Vice President, Americas Sales at Intel Corporation. “This combination delivers greater hardware consolidation and cost optimization, which, when delivered through certified configurations, directly enables AI adoption via faster infrastructure modernization.” “The pairing of purpose-built SNUC extremeEDGE servers with VMware Cloud Foundation will enable customers across industries to deliver the edge of tomorrow,” said Steve Savage, chief operating officer at SNUC. “Through self-certification of extremeEDGE as part of Broadcom’s expanded ReadyNode program, we will deliver our edge innovations faster, helping our mutual customers across industrial manufacturing, healthcare, retail, and the federal government maximize the value of AI.” Open Networking to Simplify Private Cloud Deployments with EVPN FabricsBroadcom is announcing a new strategy to unify network fabrics and simplify networking operations in the modern private cloud through standards-based EVPN and BGP networking. This strategy will enhance interoperability between application environments and the network, promoting cloud-like simplicity. The open standards approach will accelerate deployments, enable multi-vendor flexibility, and preserve existing network investments. Customers will benefit from VPC level protection, consistent network operations, routing, and visibility across VCF Networking (NSX) domains and third-party networking solutions, enabling unified operations with end-to-end fabric-driven automation. This approach aligns VCF and Cisco’s Nexus One fabric solution, promoting more consistent and reliable outcomes for mutual Cisco and VCF customers across data center fabric architectural design choices. Cisco’s unified Nexus One fabric approach implements a standard-based VXLAN EVPN control plane and data plane. With VCF’s move towards EVPN-based interoperability and a unified and open architecture, customers can drive faster innovation, shorten time to value, and lower total cost of ownership as VCF extends to the Cisco Nexus One fabric solution. “Cisco's foundational work in VxLAN EVPN, backed by the industry's most comprehensive IETF standards authorship, reflects our long-standing commitment to open networking,” said Murali Gandluru, Vice President, Data Center Networking, Cisco. “This collaboration with Broadcom demonstrates our shared commitment to open standards—giving our customers architectural flexibility and choice as they connect, protect and scale both AI and traditional, business-critical workloads.” Additionally, VCF Networking (NSX) supports Software for Open Networking in the Cloud (SONiC), an open-source network operating system based on Linux, in customer deployments today. SONiC provides customers with cost reduction by running on multi-vendor, commodity switch hardware, lowering both capital and operational expenses. The modular, containerized architecture accelerates innovation and agility, allowing operators to perform seamless, zero-downtime feature upgrades and rapid component rollbacks. Furthermore, its Linux Foundation and native API support enhances automation and control, to simplify operations and integrate networking management directly into modern, cloud-scale DevOps workflows. Open Source Community Contributions Enable Industry InnovationBroadcom continues to be an active participant in the Kubernetes community as a top five long-term contributor to CNCF, with contributions to projects such as Antrea, Cluster API, ContainerD, Contour, etcd, Harbor and others. Recently, the CNCF launched the Certified Kubernetes AI Conformance Program, a new initiative to standardize AI workloads on Kubernetes and ensure consistent, interoperable infrastructure for organizations moving AI into production. Broadcom is announcing that VMware vSphere Kubernetes Service (VKS) is now a Certified Kubernetes AI Conformant Platform. This milestone reinforces Broadcom’s commitment to open standards and helps customers innovate freely, knowing their AI platforms are built on a consistent, interoperable foundation. “VMware by Broadcom has been a long-time contributor to CNCF and continues to play a key role in supporting core projects like Kubernetes,” said Chris Aniszczyk, CTO of Cloud & Infrastructure at the Linux Foundation. “Their ongoing investment helps keep Kubernetes vendor-neutral and production-ready at scale, especially for newer AI workloads, and is critical for the health of the broader cloud native ecosystem.” Additional Resources About BroadcomBroadcom Inc.
