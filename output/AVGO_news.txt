Major U.S. equities indexes lost ground Friday after the Bureau of Labor Statistics released its latest employment report. The data showed the U.S. added fewer-than-expected jobs in August, and a downward revision to earlier estimates revealed the economy shed jobs in June, the first month of losses since 2020. The S&P 500 slid 0.3% on the final day of the holiday-shortened trading week. The Dow was down 0.5%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq ended the session with a fractional loss of less than 0.1%. Lululemon Athletica (LULU) shares fell the most of any stock in the S&P 500 on Friday, plummeting 18.6%. The maker of athletic apparel posted softer-than-expected same-store sales growth for its fiscal second quarter and trimmed its full-year revenue guidance, pointing to tariff impacts and sluggish U.S. sales. Jefferies analysts suggested Lululemon could face even tougher conditions ahead, citing competitive pressures and doubts about the company's pipeline of new designs. Shares of Kenvue (KVUE) dropped 9.4% after The Wall Street Journal reported the Department of Health and Human Services, under the leadership of Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., plans to release a report suggesting a link between autism and pregnant women's use of Tylenol. The popular over-the-counter painkiller is made by Kenvue subsidiary McNeil Consumer Healthcare. A Kenvue spokesperson on Friday contested the claims allegedly made by the report. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares tumbled 6.6% after Seaport Research downgraded the chipmaker's stock to "hold" from "buy." Analysts pointed to signs of slowing demand for AMD's artificial intelligence accelerators, and noted it could become difficult for the company to meet lofty expectations. Broadcom (AVGO) shares surged 9.4%, logging the top performance in the S&P 500, after the chipmaker reported better-than-expected sales and adjusted profit for its fiscal third quarter. Demand for AI semiconductors boosted Broadcom's performance, with AI revenue rising 63% year-over-year. The company also said it had secured $10 billion in orders from a new customer, which reports later suggested was OpenAI. Shares of pool equipment supplier Pool Corp. (POOL) advanced 5.5% after Friday's weak jobs report cemented the case for an interest rate cut at the Federal Reserve's policy meeting later this month. Expectations of a rate cut caused the 10-year Treasury yield, which influences mortgage rates, to sink to its lowest level since April. Elevated mortgage rates have kept the U.S. housing market in a deep freeze for the last three years, which has dragged on the businesses of homebuilders and home goods producers like Pool. Tesla (TSLA) proposed a new compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk that could be worth roughly $1 trillion. Reaching that amount would require the electric vehicle maker's CEO and world's richest person to achieve certain performance targets, including helping Tesla reach a market cap of $8.5 trillion and a total of 20 million vehicle deliveries. Negotiations around Musk's compensation have grown contentious in the past, and shareholders are set to vote on the proposed package on Nov. 6. Tesla stock added 3.7% Friday.

U.S. equities turned lower at midday following the government's weaker-than-expected August employment report. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq were down. Lululemon Athletica (LULU) was the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 after the fashion athletic apparel retailer reported lower-than-anticipated comparable store sales on soft demand in the U.S., and cut its guidance on higher costs relating to new tariffs and the removal of the de minimus exemption for lower-priced imports. Shares of Copart (CPRT) dipped when the online auto auctioneer missed revenue estimates as vehicle sales declined. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) shares fell on a downgrade from Seaport Research, which pointed to concerns about the chipmaker's AI accelerator business. Broadcom (AVGO) was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 after the software maker posted better-than-anticipated results and said it had a new $10 billion customer. Speculation is that the customer is AI giant OpenAI. Shares of Tesla (TSLA) rose when the electric vehicle maker offered CEO Elon Musk a 10-year pay package that could be worth $1 trillion. Docusign (DOCU) shares jumped when the electronic signature software firm beat profit and sales estimates and raised its outlook as larger customers were using its AI products. Oil futures sank. Gold prices advanced. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note dropped. The U.S. dollar lost ground to the euro, pound, and yen. Most major cryptocurrencies traded higher.

Title: Broadcom CEO Stands Alongside Steve Jobs In Memorability, Says Analyst As He Hikes Target Price To $415

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. The AI narrative is alive and kicking vigorously. If anyone were still in doubt, the recent pristine earnings print from Broadcom (AVGO) should have laid to rest any lingering consternation on that count. Broadcom, which has gained particular prominence in recent years for designing AI-specific ASICs and accelerators, reported a 22 percent year-over-year increase in revenue for its fiscal Q3 2025 to $15.95 billion, beating the consensus estimate of $15.83 billion. It also beat consensus expectations for EPS by reporting a $1.69 print. So far this year, Broadcom has launched the Tomahawk Ultra networking chip, which is an Ethernet switch chip designed for intra-data-center connectivity, and a next-gen Jericho networking chip, which is a purpose-built Ethernet router for large-scale, distributed AI clusters. Critically, Broadcom's AI semiconductor revenue surged by 63 percent year-over-year to $5.2 billion. And, completing its trifecta of beats, the company raised its guidance for Q4, now projecting total revenue of $17.4 billion and AI semiconductor revenue of $6.2 billion. It is hardly a surprise, therefore, that Melius Research's Ben Reitzes just termed Broadcom's recent earnings call as "the most bullish and memorable call" he can remember, hiking Broadcom's stock price target to $415 per share. Do note that Broadcom's surging AI semiconductor revenues remain at the heart of this nascent bullish shock, delivered with a crispness only someone of Tan's experience could have managed. Elsewhere, we came to know that OpenAI could spend $10 billion on designing an ASIC with Broadcom next year, as per a report by Financial Times. This aligns with a new $10 billion contract that Broadcom's CEO revealed during this week's earnings call. Goldman Sachs commented on this development in the following words: "We believe the most significant development was Broadcom's announcement that it has converted another new custom silicon customer focused on inference, which is expected to help drive "material" upside to management's prior expectation of AI Semiconductor revenue growth of ~60% in 2026."

Broadcom (AVGO) is helping ChatGPT maker OpenAI design and make its first-ever AI chip, according to reports. The partnership would help Broadcom challenge Nvidia's (NVDA) dominance as an AI leader. Shares in Broadcom, which last night posted fiscal third-quarter results that topped estimates Thursday on record revenue, are soaring 15% in early trading Friday, lifted by the results and the OpenAI news. Speculation about a big new customer the company disclosed last night without identifying it also helped the stock. The Financial Times, citing "people familiar with the matter," said that OpenAI was the customer that committed to $10 billion in orders Broadcom CEO Hock Tan referred to during last night's conference call. Citi analysts in a note also said they believe OpenAI was that customer. Broadcom and OpenAI didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. OpenAI will initially use the new chip for its own internal purposes, the FT reported, with shipments beginning next year, according to the FT and Bloomberg. OpenAI, which currently uses chips from Nvidia, is following the path of other big tech firms like Meta Platforms (META), Amazon (AMZN), and Alphabet’s (GOOGL) in moving to create AI chips in-house. Broadcom's quarterly results are the latest to show sustained demand for AI hardware following earnings from Nvidia (NVDA) last week, and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) last month. The company's shares have gained more than 50% so far this year. UPDATE—This article has been updated with the latest share price information.

Title: Broadcom: AVGO Stock’s Path To $600
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/05/broadcom-avgo-stocks-path-to-600/
Time Published: 2025-09-05T10:26:13Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Broadcom's stock (NASDAQ: AVGO) is climbing, buoyed by impressive quarterly earnings and a new customer win for its custom AI chips. Adding to the optimism, the company expects revenue growth to speed up next year. It's no surprise, then, that the stock has more than doubled in the past twelve months. But what could fuel another 100% gain to levels past $600 from here? We'll explore the key factors that could push the stock to new heights in the analysis that follows. That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Separately, see – What's Happening With ISRG Stock? Broadcom’s growth is anchored by its custom AI chip partnerships with top hyperscalers, namely Google (for its TPU) and Meta. In a significant development on September 4, 2025, the company announced it has secured a fourth major, unnamed customer for its custom AI accelerators (XPUs), reportedly worth $10 billion. This diversifies its revenue and solidifies its role as a key enabler for large-scale AI infrastructure. While the initial AI boom focused on training, the market is now shifting to inference, where Broadcom holds a strategic advantage. As AI applications are deployed at scale, the demand for high-performance, power-efficient inference chips and networking skyrockets. Broadcom's expertise in specialized networking and processing is critical for these workloads, positioning it to capture this massive market segment. Broadcom maintains its competitive edge through relentless product innovation. It is now shipping its Tomahawk 6 and Tomahawk Ultra networking chips, which significantly outperform their predecessor and are essential for building out large AI clusters. Furthermore, its leadership in co-packaged silicon photonics is a key technology for next-generation data centers, enabling the faster, more efficient data transfer required for advanced AI. Notably, the Tomahawk Ultra can connect up to 1,024 accelerators in a single rack, significantly more than NVIDIA’s NVLink Switch, which only supports up to 72 GPUs. Beyond hardware, the acquisition of VMware has transformed Broadcom into a major infrastructure software company. Broadcom is successfully transitioning VMware customers to subscription models and streamlining the portfolio. This strategy is already boosting recurring revenue and is expected to generate substantial, stable cash flow, significantly improving the company’s overall profit margins. For perspective, VMware, which is part of Broadcom’s infrastructure software segment, saw its revenue surge 43% y-o-y to $6.8 billion in Q3 fiscal 2025 (fiscal period ends in October). For Broadcom's stock to double in value, it relies on a powerful combination of substantial earnings growth and a sustained, premium valuation from investors. The pathway is built on two core pillars: The foundation for growth is a strong top-line forecast. We project Broadcom’s revenue could grow from around $60 billion in the last twelve months to more than $105 billion by 2028, driven primarily by its AI and VMware segments. However, the key is Broadcom's exceptional profitability. With adjusted net income margins around 50%, revenue growth has a magnified impact on the bottom line. This means earnings are positioned to grow significantly faster than sales. For example, if revenue increases by 75% over the next few years, the company's adjusted earnings per share (EPS) could nearly double from around $6.29 now to $12 in 2028. Earnings growth alone isn't enough; the stock must also maintain its high valuation multiple. Broadcom has been trading at a premium valuation of over 50 times trailing adjusted earnings for several reasons: If investors continue to assign a premium multiple of around 50x to the stock, an EPS of $12 would support a stock price of around $600. Furthermore, the multiple could expand even further if Broadcom demonstrates sustained AI revenue growth above 40%, captures more market share, and secures new large-scale customers. Despite the strong growth outlook, several risks could impact Broadcom's performance and valuation. Broadcom's AI revenue is highly dependent on a small number of hyperscale customers. While profitable, this concentration creates a significant risk; a change in spending plans or a strategic shift from even one major customer could disproportionately impact Broadcom's revenue. Any broader slowdown in the rapid pace of AI infrastructure investment would also directly threaten the company's primary growth engine. The market for AI chips and networking solutions is intensely competitive. Broadcom faces pressure from established rivals like Marvell and NVIDIA, as well as the risk of its own hyperscale customers developing more of their in-house silicon solutions. This competition could compress the high profit margins that currently justify Broadcom's premium valuation. Broadcom's stock has historically shown higher volatility during broad market downturns compared to the S&P 500. It experienced steeper declines during both the COVID-19 correction and the 2022 inflation shock. This indicates a heightened sensitivity to macroeconomic uncertainty, and a future economic slowdown or market disruption could lead to a significant drop in its stock price. Over the next few years, Broadcom's stock could double to over $600. The path to this 2x return is straightforward: the company must achieve the forecasted revenue and earnings growth while convincing the market that its premium valuation is sustainable. However, investors considering this opportunity should also weigh the risks. The stock has experienced drops of up to 50% in the past, and they must be prepared for similar volatility. Despite this, for those with an investment horizon of three years or more, Broadcom's stock has a strong potential to double from its current level. See, there always remains a meaningful risk when investing in a single, or just a handful of stocks. Consider the 30-stock Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

AVGO stock: Broadcom's fiscal third-quarter earnings exceeded expectations, fueled by robust AI demand. The company anticipates even higher revenue in the current quarter, driven by custom AI accelerators, networking components, and VMWare software.

US stocks bounced back on Thursday as the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq rebounded after days of losses, lifted by weaker-than-expected jobs data that fueled fresh hopes for a Federal Reserve rate cut in September. The move came as investors also tracked Salesforce’s steep drop, American Eagle’s surprise rally, and Stephen Miran’s Fed confirmation hearing, keeping both Wall Street and Washington in sharp focus.

Title: How To Earn $500 A Month From Broadcom Stock Ahead Of Q3 Earnings

Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime. Broadcom Inc. AVGO will release earnings results for the third quarter after the closing bell on Thursday, Sept. 4. Analysts expect the tech company to report quarterly earnings at $1.65 per share, up from $1.24 per share in the year-ago period. Broadcom projects to report quarterly revenue at $15.83 billion, compared to $13.07 billion a year earlier, according to data from Benzinga Pro. The company has beaten analyst estimates for revenue in two straight quarters and in eight of the last 10 quarters overall. Some investors are eyeing potential gains from Broadcom's annual dividend yield of 0.78%. That’s a quarterly dividend amount of 59 cents per share ($2.36 a year). To earn $500 monthly from Broadcom, start with the yearly target of $6,000 ($500 x 12 months). Next, we take this amount and divide it by Broadcom's $2.36 dividend: $6,000 / $2.36 = 2,542 shares. So, an investor would need to own approximately $768,675 worth of Broadcom, or 2,542 shares to generate a monthly dividend income of $500. Assuming a more conservative goal of $100 monthly ($1,200 annually), we do the same calculation: $1,200 / $2.36 = 508 shares, or $153,614 to generate a monthly dividend income of $100. Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis; the dividend payment and the stock price fluctuate over time. The dividend yield is calculated by dividing the annual dividend payment by the current stock price. As the stock price changes, the dividend yield will also change. For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and its current price is $50, its dividend yield would be 4%. However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield would decrease to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price decreases to $40, the dividend yield would increase to 5% ($2/$40). Further, the dividend payment itself can also change over time, which can also impact the dividend yield. If a company increases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will increase even if the stock price remains the same. Similarly, if a company decreases its dividend payment, the dividend yield will decrease. AVGO Price Action: Shares of Broadcom rose by 1.4% to close at $302.39 on Wednesday.

Title: Why Nvidia and Other Chip Stocks' Slump Is an Opportunity for Investors, UBS Says

Semiconductor stocks are taking a chip out of U.S. indexes to start September—a month that's earned a reputation as the worst for American investors—but for some bulls on Wall Street, that could mean it's time to buy. "We recommend that investors who are underallocated to equities consider phasing in and using market dips to add exposure to preferred areas," UBS analysts said Tuesday, with tech and AI plays among their favorites, while chip stocks dragged on the sector to start the week. Nvidia (NVDA) was one of the worst-performing stocks on the Dow Jones Industrial Average Tuesday afternoon, with shares down nearly 3%. Broadcom (AVGO), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and other chip stocks were also lower, with the PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX) down 2%. Tuesday's slide extended losses late last week, amid uncertainty after an appeals court Friday challenged the legality of the Trump administration's "reciprocal" tariffs, and concerns about America's relations with major trading partners. Treasury yields spiked as bonds sold off, which tends to weigh on the tech sector as higher yields may make growth stocks less attractive. Some investors could also be worried about September's reputation as a tough month for stocks—but that shouldn't discourage them, according to UBS analysts. That's because October and November tend to be strong months for U.S. stocks, they said, with average S&P 500 returns over the past decade of 1.2% and 4%, respectively. Buying in September could help investors position themselves for better performance in the months that follow. UBS also pointed to strong earnings in the second quarter, a robust outlook for AI demand, and expectations of a rate cut later this month as reasons supporting their optimism in the tech sector. "Alongside AI, power and resources, and longevity, we favor US technology, health care, utilities, and financials," the analysts said.

Title: What Nvidia's Earnings Could Mean for Broadcom and Other Chipmakers

As one of the primary beneficiaries of the AI boom, chipmaker Nvidia's (NVDA) stock has become a bellwether for industry, with its quarterly results last week offering some clues about what to expect from Broadcom (AVGO) later this week, and other chipmakers. Nvidia's earnings, which came in just ahead of Wall Street's estimates, largely received a bullish reception from analysts, who voiced confidence in demand for its AI hardware, though worries about China sales and geopolitical issues have weighed on the stock. Shares of Nvidia dropped nearly 3% in recent trading, and Broadcom shares slipped 1%, with other chip stocks extending last week's declines as uncertainty about tariffs and America's relations with major trading partners weighed on the major indexes. A diplomatic summit in Tianjin over the weekend with leaders from more than 20 non-Western countries, including Chinese President Xi Jinping, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and Russian President Vladimir Putin, sought to showcase China's leadership amid trade tensions with the U.S. AI chipmaker Broadcom, which Oppenheimer analysts have called the "No. 2 AI franchise" after Nvidia, is set to report its fiscal third-quarter results after the bell on Thursday, and could face some similar challenges related to its large exposure to China—as well as benefit from AI tailwinds. Like Nvidia, Broadcom derives a significant chunk of its sales from China, with the country accounting for roughly a fifth of Broadcom's revenue in its fiscal 2024, though that's declined from almost a third in 2023. Broadcom also claims some of the same Big Tech AI clients Nvidia does, including Meta Platforms (META) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), with their commitments to hefty AI spending expected to benefit the chipmaker. Citi analysts suggested last week Broadcom could also have plans with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, Elon Musk's xAI, and Apple (AAPL) in its pipeline. The Citi analysts have a "buy" rating and $315 price target for the stock, which finished Friday's session around $297. Despite recent losses, it has added more than one-quarter of its value since the start of the year. Oppenheimer expects Broadcom could have even further to climb, with a $325 target, still well below a Street high of $350, according to Visible Alpha. Heading into the results, Wall Street analysts are overwhelmingly bullish on Broadcom's stock, anticipating rising sales and profits. All of the 10 analysts with current ratings compiled by Visible Alpha give it a "buy" or equivalent rating. CORRECTION—Sept. 2, 2025: This article has been corrected to reflect the U.S. was not represented at the summit in Tianjin and President Trump did not attend.

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) is set to announce its earnings on Thursday, September 4, 2025. Historical records indicate that purchasing AVGO stock prior to the earnings announcement has often been a successful strategy. In the past five years, the stock has recorded positive one-day returns 75% of the time, with a median increase of 3.0% and a peak single-day return of 24.4%. For traders focused on specific events, having a strong grasp of historical trends can be beneficial, although the results are largely contingent on how the company’s outcomes measure up to market anticipations. Two separate strategies may be employed for events of this nature: Consensus forecasts for the upcoming report predict earnings of $1.66 per share on revenues of $15.82 billion. This indicates significant growth from the same quarter last year, which reported earnings of $1.24 per share and revenues of $13.07 billion. From a fundamental perspective, Broadcom has a market capitalization of $1.4 trillion. The company has showcased robust financial results over the past year, achieving $57 billion in revenue, $21 billion in operating profits, and $13 billion in net income. That said, if you're looking for potential upside with reduced volatility compared to holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has significantly outperformed its benchmark—a blend of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Additionally, see – Ethereum Play: BMNR Stock To $100? See earnings reaction history of all stocks Here are some insights on one-day (1D) post-earnings returns: Additional data on the observed 5-Day (5D) and 21-Day (21D) returns after earnings are summarized alongside the statistics in the table below. A less risky strategy (although not useful if the correlation is weak) is to understand the correlation between short-term and medium-term returns following earnings, identify a pair that has the strongest correlation, and execute the necessary trade. For instance, if 1D and 5D exhibit the highest correlation, a trader may position themselves "long" for the subsequent 5 days if the 1D post-earnings return is positive. Below is some correlation data based on a 5-year and a 3-year (more recent) history. Please note that the correlation 1D_5D refers to the relationship between 1D post-earnings returns and the following 5D returns. Also, see – Buy or Fear AVGO Stock? Occasionally, the performance of peers can impact the stock reaction following earnings. In fact, the pricing may begin even before the earnings are revealed. Below is some historical data on the past post-earnings performance of Broadcom stock in comparison to the stock performance of peers that announced earnings just before Broadcom. For a fair comparison, peer stock returns are also represented as post-earnings one-day (1D) returns. Discover more about Trefis RV strategy which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combining all three indexes: the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000), yielding strong returns for investors. Additionally, if you desire upside with a steadier experience compared to an individual stock like Broadcom, explore the High Quality portfolio, which has outpaced the S&P and achieved >91% returns since it began.
