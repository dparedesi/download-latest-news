Skip to comments. Posted on 10/21/2025 8:51:43 AM PDT by SunkenCiv Names across the A.I. space rallied Monday on the back of Nvidia (NVDA) unveiling its first Blackwell wafer produced at TSMC's (TSM) Phoenix plant. Austin Lyons lays out where he sees the state of A.I. heading as demand sees no sign of slowing down. He believes increased competition in AMD Inc. (AMD) and Broadcom (AVGO) won't steal much of Nvidia's market share but will open the door to new chipmaking processes. As for A.I.'s next leg, Austin talks about the importance of data centers and energy as A.I. tech becomes more advanced. AMD & AVGO's Room to Take NVDA Market Share as A.I.

The AI came along created massive and largely unanticipated demand for that market niche. Nvida will have to work hard to keep their market dominance as legacy players like Intel get in the game to develop advanced products for the market. Intel has made a lot of missteps and it has been crippled by it's own success by focusing on selling premium priced derivatives of massive installed base of chips and it has missed the market on emerging advanced chip applications that would have cannibalized sales of it's premium bread and butter chips. . IIn a world where the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, Intel has fallen behind the rich getting richer crew but they still have lot of good technology and it would be a mistake to rule them out if they get their act together. Other players like AMD are still in game with products that are less than a generation behind Nvida and they are behind primarily as a conscious business decision based on market position for a lower performance, lower cost, higher volume segment of the market. The rapid explosion in AI in such a short time has caught them by surprise but it's not unreasonable to assume that they can quickly catch up if they choose to focus on the very high performance, AI driven segment of the market. Nvida is a relatively young company that has made it's way with aggressive implementation of a specialized technology. They do not yet have the full range of resources that some of their competition has. This could be a hindrance or an advantage so it is going to be interesting to see how things shake out in the AI world.

Hopefully this will cut nVidia‚Äôs extremely ridiculous prices down within our stratosphere. AMD stock went from about $164 on Oct 3rd to today at $238 AMD deal with OpenAI predict $600 a share maybe in 4 years... üòÅ I‚Äôve had 2 ATI Radeon in the past 20 years, and they both failed within a week. I haven‚Äôt had one since AMD took it over, but if nVidia won‚Äôt drop their prices to a reasonable level, I may have to try again with Radeon. As for motherboards, the last Intel I had was in 1998, when I first got to Japan, since was the only one available at the time. I only build my computers with AMD motherboards and CPUs.
