Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 After testing all-time highs, the major indices are in the red this morning. Dow futures are down 301 points. Nasdaq futures are down 344, as the S&P 500 sinks about 70 points. All thanks to a decline in Palantir’s overvalued shares, despite the company beating earnings estimates and offering solid guidance. There are also concerns about the stretched valuations of other key AI stocks and their ability to boost profits to justify numbers. Still, analysts are out with new upgrades. Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO): Analysts at Jefferies reiterated a buy rating on AVGO and named it as a top pick. The firm also raised its price target to $480 from $415. As noted by the analysts, “While NVDA remains the leader and we still see upside there, AVGO has a greater magnitude of estimate upside as Google, Meta, and OAI ASICs ramp,” as quoted by CNBC. “Google has long been the main ASIC customer for AVGO, but those volumes should become much more meaningful in C26/27.” Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA): Loop Capital reiterated its buy rating on the tech giant and hiked its price target to $350 from $250. The firm believes NVDA can double its GPU shipments over the next year to 15 months to 2.1 million by the January 2026 quarter. Goldman Sachs reiterated its buy rating on NVDA with a price target of $240 from $210 ahead of earnings, as well. The firm believes investor expectations have increased heading into NVDA earnings, thanks to multiple AI infrastructure announcements. The firm also believes NVDA will provide a beat and raise quarter. Helping, Nvidia is up on news that Microsoft secured export licenses from the Trump Administration to ship NVDA chips to the United Arab Emirates. CoreWeave (NASDAQ: CRWV): Analysts at Citi reiterated a buy rating on CRWV ahead of earnings, with a price target of $192 from $164. The firm pointed to rising AI demand as a CRWV tailwind. “In the near term, we see CRWV as one of the larger AI beneficiaries across our coverage. With recent deals signed with NVDA, META, and an OpenAI expansion, we estimate ~85% QoQ backlog growth,” they said, as quoted by CNBC. “As Blackwell + customer ramps come online in 4Q, we expect a revenue reacceleration into year-end and outsized (~$100M+) revenue beats.” The image featured for this article is © LALAKA / Shutterstock.com Latest Podcast Episode OpenAI Signs Two Massive Deals and Two New Portfolio Buys 51 min See us invest in our favorite AI stock ideas for free Live Nov 4, 2025 Live Oct 30, 2025 The broad markets are mixed to kick off trading today.

Title: Here's What We Learned From Big Tech Earnings Last Week
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/here-is-what-we-learned-from-big-tech-earnings-last-week-11841183
Time Published: 2025-11-02T11:00:00Z

Earnings season kicked into high gear last week when five of the Magnificent Seven members with a combined market value of over $15 trillion reported results. The tech titans—Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META)—reported better-than-expected results across the board, and forecast their massive investments in artificial intelligence will grow in the coming year. Below, we take a closer look at some of the key takeaways from this round of big tech earnings. These tech giants account for a sizable share of the U.S. stock market, making their quarterly earnings some of the most highly anticipated and consequential events on Wall Street. Their investments in artificial intelligence have also been a boon to the U.S. economy over the last year. One thing made clear in last week's earnings calls, was that the hyperscalers’ AI investments are showing no signs of a pullback. Amazon on Thursday raised its full-year capital expenditures forecast and said that investments will increase next year. Alphabet also bumped up its capex guidance for the third time this year and forecast another “significant” increase next year. Microsoft didn’t share a quarterly or full-year capex estimate, but CFO Amy Hood said investments will grow even faster in fiscal year 2026 than in 2025. Executives stressed that, despite their massive investments up to this point, they expect demand will continue to outstrip supply into next year. Microsoft’s cloud computing platform, Azure, likely bore the brunt of its capacity constraints, according to Hood, who said the company has been forced to prioritize other core business offerings. She, like Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, also said that their internal AI teams need more computing capacity. Citi analysts in a note on Thursday said they expect cloud data center capex to grow 24% in 2026, which should be a boon to semiconductor makers like Nvidia (NVDA), Broadcom (AVGO), and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Spending on data centers is all well and good with Wall Street, as long as investors perceive rising profits will make it worthwhile. Meta shares tanked on Thursday after the company posted earnings that missed estimates due to a one-time tax charge, and raised the low end of its full-year capex guidance. Meta also said it expects its capex growth will accelerate next year. "The real focus coming out of earnings is Meta's updated view on 2026 capex and expenses as the company looks to build out an industry-leading amount of compute," JPMorgan analysts told clients in a note Thursday. "The costs for Meta are outsized relative to Google and Amazon, as those companies are larger and both have cloud businesses that provide an immediate path to Gen AI monetization, unlike for Meta,” they said. Higher operating costs added to Wall Street’s concerns about Meta’s AI spending. Total expenses rose 32% year-over-year in the third quarter, compared to 12% in the previous quarter, and are expected to grow even faster next year. Employee compensation was one of the largest contributors to rising expenses. Meta went on an AI hiring spree this year, making headlines for poaching top talent with eye-watering pay packages. That's added more pressure on Meta to find ways to cut costs. Recent reports of layoffs, including in its AI division, could point to some signs of strain in Meta's efforts to keep its spending in check. In the first inning of the AI craze on Wall Street, Alphabet was often looked at as a laggard in the space. Its Bard chatbot flubbed its first public demonstration, and analysts worried that the rising popularity of chatbots from startups like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Perplexity, could spell major disruption for Google’s core search business. However, Alphabet's strong quarterly results—thanks in part to AI search features—would counter that narrative. According to executives, Google’s AI search features, AI Overviews and AI Mode, are helping to increase search query volume, the opposite of what Wall Street expected. Google’s search revenue growth has accelerated throughout the year, rising from 10% to 12% in the second quarter, and then to 15% in the third. Executives added that Google is monetizing AI search queries at about the same rate as traditional search. “Search acceleration (paid clicks up 7% vs 4% in 2Q) despite OpenAI's strong usage growth suggests AI is expanding the overall ‘information’ opportunity, driving higher query volume and improving monetization,” wrote Bank of America analysts in a note on Thursday. Some investors have become concerned in recent months that the AI boom is being fueled by a handful of companies striking very large deals. For example, OpenAI accounted for nearly all of Oracle’s (ORCL) massive cloud computing backlog in the most recent quarter, and Nvidia said in its most recent earnings report that two direct customers accounted for almost 40% of its quarterly sales. But Microsoft executives sought to soothe worries about concentration risks during Wednesday’s earnings call. When asked about the breadth of contracts contributing to Microsoft’s record backlog, which grew 51% to $392 billion, CFO Amy Hood said, “it covers numerous products. It covers customers of all sizes." CEO Satya Nadella also suggested he sees broadening demand related to AI over time, telling analysts, “concentration risk gets mitigated by being thoughtful about how you really ensure the build is for the broad customer base.” The wider enterprise adoption cycle, he said, "is just starting."

Title: This Stock Market Bubble Is Not Real (This 8% Dividend Proves It)

ByMichael Foster, Contributor. Are we in a stock market bubble or not? Let’s tackle that question head-on, because it’s all we seem to be hearing about these days. I’ll put my cards on the table: We’re not in a bubble. I’m going to show you why I’m still bullish on stocks at these levels. Then we’re going to play overwrought bubble fears with a “cornerstone” fund that’s beaten stocks over just about every timeline but is still cheap (and yields a rich 8%, too). When it comes to stocks, the truth is, there’s a good reason why they keep rising: We’re in a booming economy. Of course, you might not feel that way—many communities across America are suffering. Income inequality, crime, corruption—it’s a mess out there. Those are all serious problems, to be sure. But just as the stock market is not the economy, the stock market is not society, either, and those problems can co-exist with a rising market. Stocks are rising because their moves are tied to one thing: earnings. And earnings are soaring. Bloomberg recently reported on something we’ve been talking about for a while here at Contrarian Outlook and in my CEF Insider service: Earnings are growing as companies improve their profits through efficiency gains, some of which are driven by AI. In fact, the earnings beats we’re seeing come from across the economy, from companies as diverse as General Motors (GM), Coca-Cola (KO), Morgan Stanley (MS) and, of course, tech names like Broadcom (AVGO) and Lam Research (LRCX). While tech continues to be the top-performing sector, there’s good reason to expect that more and more gains will come from outside of tech, as new innovations spread from that sector into other parts of the economy. This doesn’t mean we should simply avoid tech and buy the rest of the market. After all, tech’s earnings gains are the strongest out there and will likely remain so, although financials are a close second. At a time like this, we want broad-based market exposure. But of course, as my CEF Insider members know, we do not want an index fund. Their paltry 1% yields are just plain unacceptable to us income investors. Instead, we’re going with a closed-end fund (CEF) that invests in a broad range of S&P 500 stocks, but with a key difference: This one pays a rich 8% yield. That would be the Adams Diversified Equity Fund (ADX), which holds tech darlings like Broadcom, as well as top performers from other sectors, like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM). Thanks to its well-crafted portfolio, ADX hasn’t just matched the stock market’s returns over the last decade—it’s beaten it. This is why, at CEF Insider, we’ve been holding ADX for almost the entire time shown on this chart (and we would’ve held it for the entire time if CEF Insider had launched in 2015, rather than in 2017). This outperformance is great—but so is the dividend. ADX has yielded around 9.5% over the last decade, thanks to the huge special payouts management issued at year-end. But in 2024, the fund changed its distribution plans, going with a more evenly spread payout tied to the fund’s net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio). Now, ADX’s regular distributions are more consistent and reliable. The fund pays about 8% now, largely because the stock price is up over 13% in 2025 (as prices rise, yields fall). But its total return including dividends is 21.7% for the year, as of this writing, again far ahead of the S&P 500, at 16.6%. In other words, this fund has outperformed over the short and the long term. Yet it still trades at a discount to NAV. ADX’s discount is now 8.3%, but it was over 10% at the start of the year (and was around 12% most of the time before that). With the fund’s high yield, market outperformance and smartly built portfolio, this discount is likely to disappear, especially as more money comes into stocks as bubble fears fade. If you buy ADX today, you can still lock in this discount, boosting your upside potential while also securing that healthy yield. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.
