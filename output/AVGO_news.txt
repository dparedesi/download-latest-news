Broadcom is a fabless semiconductor company that designs semiconductors for a range of different industries and applications, based in Palo Alto, California. The company plays an important role in providing semiconductors for AI, specifically, they provide hyperscale data centre companies custom silicon chips. Over time, as companies such as Meta, Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft build out their AI offering, the critical semiconductor content will come from both custom silicon chips, designed by companies such as Broadcom, and merchant silicon chips, designed by Nvidia. Depending on the use case, or workload, the hyperscaler will use either a custom silicon semiconductor or a merchant silicon semiconductor. Therefore, over time we expect AI processes to be driven by both Nvidia designed chips and custom designed chips from Broadcom and its peers.

Title: Broadcom Inc. (AVGO): Dominating AI and Semiconductor Markets with Record Revenue Growth and Strategic Collaborations

We recently compiled a list of the Blackrock's 30 Most Important AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other AI stocks. In the third quarter of 2024, investment titan Blackrock released a commentary on the market outlook for artificial intelligence heading into the closing months of the year, stressing that investors were becoming cautious about the scale of AI spending by tech firms and thus diversifying investments into energy, utilities, real estate, and resources tied to AI infrastructure (for more on this click on 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock). Following this warning, in September 2024, BlackRock, in collaboration with Microsoft, Global Infrastructure Partners, and MGX, announced a new AI partnership aimed at investing in data centers and supporting power infrastructure. This initiative was part of a larger strategy by the investment firm to enhance American competitiveness in AI while meeting the growing need for energy infrastructure to power economic growth. The investment giant also expanded product offerings to cater to the growing interest in AI. In October 2024, the firm launched two new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) designed to provide investors with exposure to the burgeoning AI market. These ETFs aimed to capitalize on the increasing demand for AI-driven investment opportunities. Though still in their early stages, the initiatives appear to have paid off. BlackRock reported a net profit of $6.37 billion last year, marking a 16% increase from the previous year. Revenues rose by 14% to $20.4 billion, and assets under management expanded to $11.55 trillion. The firm has attributed a major part of this growth to advancements in AI technologies and projected that AI will be a significant driver of US equities and economic expansion in 2025. The BlackRock Investment Institute notes that AI innovations are expected to outpace similar developments in Europe, with private markets playing a crucial role in funding AI-related infrastructure. BlackRock's 2025 Global Outlook suggests that the global economy has moved beyond the traditional boom and bust cycle due to transformative mega forces such as AI technologies, net-zero carbon emission efforts, geopolitical fragmentation, demographic shifts, and the digitization of finance. The firm believes that significant investments, akin to those of the Industrial Revolution, are needed, particularly in infrastructure tied to AI and green technology. The claims made by BlackRock in relation to AI are shared by investment firm JPMorgan. Read more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave. According to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan, investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain instead of focusing on obvious choices. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025. The Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now make up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and have driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023. This performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x. Analysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes. JPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. JPMorgan has warned that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem. The bank has cautioned that this weakness can spread throughout the AI value chain. The report notes that the attention of investors has so far focused on AI hardware and AI hyperscalers, two areas of the AI industry more exposed to the technology and communication services sectors. Per JPMorgan, high levels of valuation dispersion in these categories suggest that opportunities for skilled stock pickers persist, but investors must recognize that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility.

(NASDAQ:AVGO) supplies semiconductor infrastructure software solutions. This company stands out as a worthwhile investment due to a combination of multiple factors. Firstly, as per the final report of the fiscal year 2024, the revenue grew 44% year-over-year to a record $51.6 billion, as infrastructure software revenue increased to $21.5 billion on the successful integration of VMware. Semiconductor revenue recorded was $30.1 billion, driven by AI revenue of $12.2 billion. AI revenue that grew 220% year-on-year was driven by the company’s leading AI XPUs and Ethernet networking portfolio. Secondly, the company is collaborating with different major tech companies, including Google, Meta Platforms, ByteDance, OpenAI, and Apple, to develop custom AI server chips, which will further solidify its position in the AI accelerator market and attract investors.

They draw half the power of alternatives while offering industry-leading SerDes, telemetry and diagnostic capabilities. Overall AVGO ranks 8th on our list of Blackrock's most important AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Title: Broadcom Inc. (AVGO): AI at the Core of Technology

We recently published a list of 10 Must-Watch AI Stocks on Investors’ Radar. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other must-watch AI stocks on investors’ radar. With everyone competing towards supremacy in artificial intelligence, the latest country to intensify its efforts has been Britain. As reported by Reuters, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Monday, January 13th, that he wanted to make the UK an artificial intelligence “superpower”. To reach this goal, the Prime Minister has promised to take a pro-innovation approach to regulation, make public data available to researchers, and create zones for data centers. READ ALSO: Top 10 AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News and 15 Important AI News and Ratings on Investors’ Radar Starmer plans to make artificial intelligence a key part of his strategy to boost the economy. According to the government, the technology could improve productivity by 1.5% a year, translating to an extra 47 billion pounds ($57 billion) annually over a decade. “Britain will be one of the great AI superpowers. We’re going to make the breakthroughs, we’re going to create the wealth, and we’re going to make AI work for everyone in our country”. Another country that has been actively striving towards reaching supremacy when it comes to AI has been the US. In its latest efforts, the US government is moving to restrict artificial intelligence chip and technology exports further. Dozens of countries will be facing new restrictions on the export of advanced computer chips and other artificial intelligence (AI) technology. According to officials, the new rules are intended to make sure that “the world’s AI runs on American rails” and keep it out of the hands of “malicious actors” who could use it to threaten the United States. Even though the US government may think it’s heading in the right direction, many top tech companies don’t necessarily agree. “In the wrong hands, powerful AI systems have the potential to exacerbate significant national security risks, including by enabling the development of weapons of mass destruction, supporting powerful offensive cyber operations, and aiding human rights abuses, such as mass surveillance”. Chipmaker Nvidia is also against these restrictions and will be the most impacted by the plan. According to the chipmaker, if the restrictions are implemented, they would not “mitigate any threat” but only “weaken America’s global competitiveness” and undermine its innovation. “By attempting to rig market outcomes and stifle competition—the lifeblood of innovation—the Biden Administration’s new rule threatens to squander America’s hard-won technological advantage”.

Title: Why Is Cliff Asness Bullish On Broadcom Inc. (AVGO)?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Invest in According to Billionaire Cliff Asness. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other stocks recommended by Cliff Asness. The founder, managing principal, and chief investment officer of AQR Capital Management, Cliff Asness is a well-known name in the financial industry. Setting off with a $10 million commitment from a small group of investors in 1995, Asness managed to grow the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund's assets to over a $100 million in a matter of months. Distinct even among hedge fund managers, Cliff Asness' investment strategies, focusing on value and momentum strategies, have produced impressive outcomes for AQR Capital over the years. As an example, AQR's flagship Absolute Return fund had a spectacular year in 2022 after declining by over 30% from its peak in 2018. It rose 43.5%, the best performance since launch in 1998. The fund saw a 16.8% increase in 2021, and 18.4% in 2023, making it the best performing multi-strategy fund among its competitors. In its latest 13F filing for Q3 2024, AQR Capital Management disclosed a portfolio value $72.4 billion in 13F securities, with a top 10 holdings concentration of 14.07%. In his interview for the book Efficiently Inefficient, Cliff Asness talks about the similarities between judgmental (discretionary) and quantitative investing, stating that both strategies look for cheap stocks with potential catalysts to raise or lower their values. He emphasized how quants use diversification and apply models across thousands of stocks to lower the risk factor, whereas judgmental investors tend to concentrate their holdings, thus relying on in-depth company knowledge. That said, Asness admitted that quant investors do go through periods of underperformance, even with the advantages of thorough data analysis. Asness has had much to say about Bitcoin over the years. According to the billionaire, the cryptocurrency remains in a speculative bubble after the post-election rally carried it over the $100,000 mark. Speaking on the cryptocurrency on CNBC's Money Movers, Asness stated the following: “I’m on the bubble side, on net. To move me off that, you really need not a price change, but a use case. That’s what could convince me to become maybe more of a crypto person when I find any use for it, aside from speculation and criminality.” Following a massive year-end surge following president-elect Donald Trump's victory, Bitcoin surged 120% in 2024. With hopes of a national strategic Bitcoin reserve and pro-industry deregulation, investors expected Trump to bring about a golden age of crypto. Although Asness doesn't harbor good prospects for Bitcoin, he stated that he wouldn't short the cryptocurrency either, due to the volatile nature of crypto. Despite proponents of Bitcoin contending that the cryptocurrency is here to stay and will eventually gain widespread acceptance, Asness' criticisms highlight the absence of real-world applications outside speculative investing. He still views Bitcoin cautiously because he thinks its legitimacy as a store of value and a medium of exchange has not been established. Along with his comments regarding Bitcoin, Asness also expressed his worries about the larger U.S. stock market, stating that high cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratios will cause equities to struggle in the upcoming years. He predicts that during the following ten years, U.S. stocks will probably provide mediocre returns, with just slight outperformance over cash. Our Methodology To make our list of the ten best stocks to invest in according to Cliff Asness, we ranked all the stocks part of AQR Capital Managment's Q3 2024 13F SEC filings and picked the fund's top 10 stock holdings. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of AQR Capital Management's stake value. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here). A technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit. AQR Capital Management's stake as of Q3: $558.8 million One of the largest names in technology, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) has a strong presence in both the hardware and software sectors. The company's core strength lies in providing networking and custom chips for a number of different applications. Back on December 23, 2024, UBS increased its price target for Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) to $270, up from $220, while maintaining a Buy rating. The updated artificial intelligence revenue forecasts for fiscal years 2026 and 2027 reflect roughly 20% and 40% in expected growth, respectively. This outlook was determined on the assumptions of a conservative market share, as well as anticipations around the expansion of the company's serviceable addressable market (SAM), as Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) gets ready to add two more hyperscaler clients for its AI offerings. For its fiscal fourth-quarter 2024 results, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) reported $14.1 billion in revenue alongside an EPS of $1.42. The company's semiconductor division did incredibly well, generating about $8.2 billion in revenue driven by sustained AI demand. In comparison, the software segment didn't fare quite as well, generating $5.8 billion in revenue. Even so, the tech giant expects $14.6 billion in revenue, a 66% EBITDA margin, as well as an implied EPS of $1.51 for Q1 2025. On top of that, Broadcom counts on a sizable increase in XPU ASIC production during the second half of the year, powered by new 3nm products expected to deliver unit growth and higher average selling prices. Overall AVGO ranks 9th on our list of the stocks recommended by billionaire Cliff Asness. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.
