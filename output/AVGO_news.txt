The U.S. stock market entered the final quarter of the year near record highs, boosted by soaring AI stocks that have become increasingly critical for the market's performance. Most of the best-performing stocks in the S&P 500 this year are directly tied to the AI boom. Data storage companies Seagate Technology (STX) and Western Digital (WDC) have seen their shares nearly triple in value this year, while Palantir (PLTR) and Applovin (APP), two software firms that have excelled at translating AI capabilities into revenue, have more than doubled. And despite a rough start to 2025, all of the Magnificent Seven stocks are up since the start of the year. The artificial intelligence boom has been the primary source of fuel propelling the bull market of the past few years. As such, the performance of most investment portfolios is increasingly tethered to the performance of AI stocks. The Magnificent Seven account for one-third of the S&P 500, and thus have an outsized influence over the broader market’s performance. And these stocks, experts say, are increasingly tied to AI. The Mag 7's “share prices are a daily referendum on whether AI is considered hype or reality,” wrote Christopher Gannatti, Global Head of Research at WisdomTree, in a recent blog post. They “are priced as if AI is not just a growth driver, but the growth driver,” Gannatti added. As such, the investments, deals and optimism propelling the AI trade are likely to be pivotal for the entire stock market in the coming months. Massive infrastructure investment from the likes of Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META) has been a primary source of fuel for the AI rally. Their spending has caused revenue at chipmakers like Nvidia (NVDA), Broadcom (AVGO) and Micron (MU) to explode, and underpinned the narrative that AI demand is insatiable. The hyperscalers will all update investors on their capital expenditure plans when they report quarterly results in late October and early November. Alphabet and Meta each lifted their capex forecasts in their most recent earnings reports, while Microsoft and Amazon said they would continue to invest heavily in infrastructure throughout the year. Tax changes codified by the One Big, Beautiful Bill, which empowers companies to immediately write off infrastructure investments, could give them reason to lift capex further. Experts note immediate write-offs should boost free cash flow, allowing companies to invest even more in AI. Hyperscalers have had a few months to figure out how the bill, which was signed into law by President Donald Trump on July 4, will affect their finances and, thus, investments. Citi analysts on Tuesday estimated that hyperscalers, including Oracle (ORCL) and CoreWeave (CRWV), will spend $490 billion on infrastructure, up from their prior estimate of $420 billion. “We expect the major hyperscalers to reflect this incremental spend in guidance discussions during 3Q results,” the analysts wrote. Unexpected increases to capex guidance could reinforce Wall Street’s bullishness on the semiconductor, software, and energy companies benefiting most from the AI buildout. “We’re seeing a bit of an evolution” in the drivers of the AI rally, Gannatti told Investopedia. “It kind of started with the hyperscalers—Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet—saying, ‘We have a certain amount of cash flow. We’re going to make investments.’” Today, Gannatti says, AI companies are investing in one another, and using those investments to buy goods and services from each other. The most notable example of this was announced last month, when OpenAI committed to deploying 10 gigawatts of Nvidia systems to train and run its next-generation models. In return, Nvidia will invest $100 billion in OpenAI as capacity comes online, effectively subsidizing the start-up's infrastructure expenses. “So there’s a bit of circularity,” says Gannatti, who notes there’s a risk to these sorts of deals. “None of these things are guaranteed,” he said, including OpenAI’s commitment to spend $300 billion on Oracle’s cloud computing services over the next five years. “If the business environment changes, the music might need to stop—not necessarily forever, but for a while.” Investors have worried about an AI bubble for quite some time, and the rally faces the risk that AI sentiment sours, weighing on investment and depressing stock valuations. So far, tech companies have been able to show investors enough benefit from AI to keep Wall Street comfortable with their spending, said Gannatti. “But you feel like you’re always one earnings cycle away from a negative interpretation of a certain announcement,“ the kind of less-than-ideal development that throws cold water on a red-hot market, he added. Several events this year have briefly appeared to be this watershed moment. In January, investors caught wind of Chinese start-up DeepSeek’s super-efficient reasoning model, briefly calling into question the wisdom of Silicon Valley’s AI spending. And AI stocks swooned over the summer when an MIT study found that 95% of corporate generative AI pilot projects failed to deliver any material return on investment. Yet, on every occasion, investors have shaken off the panic and continued to pile into AI stocks. There are reasons to be optimistic that today’s AI boom is more resilient than the bubbles to which it is often compared. “The positive is it’s not being financed by debt, at least not yet,” said Gannatti. “So it's not like the fiber optic buildouts in, say, 1999 and 2000, where the companies didn't even have the fundamentals.” Instead, the companies funding the AI buildout have some of the biggest businesses, healthiest balance sheets, and deepest pockets of any companies on earth. Their hugely profitable non-AI businesses could mitigate the fallout of a shift in sentiment toward AI.

Title: The 10 Strongest-Performing Mega-Cap Stocks Of 2025
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamsarhan/2025/09/30/the-10-strongest-performing-mega-cap-stocks-of-2025/

ByAdam Sarhan, Contributor. As we prepare for the fourth quarter of 2025, I find it very useful to look at the strongest stocks in 2025. I sort stocks on a year-to-date percent change basis. This exercise helps me easily spot “leading” stocks and it helps remove emotions from the decision making process. Also, it helps me find leading stocks and wait for proper buy points because many times, leading stocks tend to be in strong uptrends that can last several years. Of course, there’s a chance any and all of these stocks fall. It’s just a good exercise to see what the strongest stocks are in the market at any given time. Here are the ten strongest mega-cap stocks (so far) in 2025: 1. Palantir (PLTR)Palantir is the strongest performing mega cap stock in the market (as of this writing 9/30/25) on a year-to-date percent change basis. Palantir is a leading tech/AI stock that is growing rapidly. The company continued converting a large pipeline of government and commercial contracts into sustainable recurring revenue in 2025. Its platform-based approach is unique because it integrates data, analytics, and operational workflows. All that makes it sticky among large customers who increasingly treat Palantir as a mission-critical software partner. Expansion into vertical solutions and success in platform monetization (subscription plus consumption-based fees) contributed to stronger revenue visibility and improving operating leverage. As profitability metrics advanced, market skepticism diminished and the multiple expanded. 2. AppLovin (APP)AppLovin is another monster stock in 2025. The company developed a mobile app ecosystem to help developers monetize their work. The company is ad-tech and mobile-software player that combines effective user-acquisition tools, a growing independent game publishing arm, and targeted monetization services to grow earnings by triple digits in each of the past 4 quarters. In 2025, the company benefited from robust mobile-ad demand, improvements in measurement and privacy-safe targeting, and a higher-margin mix of platform services. Strategic investments in creative optimization, in-app commerce, and cross-promotion improved ROI for advertisers and developers, boosting revenue per active user and driving solid margin improvements. 3. General Electric (GE)General Electric’s (yes the giant industrial company) stock has soared this year. GE’s turnaround gained traction recently thanks in part to Trump’s made in America policies. GE is a leader in aviation, renewable-energy equipment, grid technologies, and many other important industries in our economy. The company has been able to focus on higher-value services and long-term service agreements which increased recurring revenue and smoothed cyclicality. Capital redeployment toward high-return businesses, debt reduction, and portfolio simplification enhanced investor confidence. Renewable and electrification tailwinds — particularly in gas turbines and wind-turbine services — supported a favorable outlook for orders and backlog conversion. All this has helped GE become one of the strongest performing mega cap stocks in 2025. 4. Oracle (ORCL)Oracle’s stock is an absolute monster stock. The stock vaulted over 40% after its most recent earnings report. That move made Larry Ellison the richest man in the world, surpassing Elon Musk! Oracle’s recent pivot to multi-year cloud based services has been a huge win. The company has emphasized autonomous database capabilities and verticalized cloud stacks and all that led to massive earnings and revenue growth. Subscription and cloud services growth accelerated as enterprise customers migrated mission-critical workloads to Oracle’s Gen2 and industry-focused cloud offerings. All this has helped sales and revenue grow. 5. Uber (UBER)Uber has grown far beyond just being a ride-hailing app. Today, it’s a global platform that moves people, food, and goods across dozens of countries—and in 2025, the company really hit its stride. Uber leaned on a multi-pronged growth playbook: the rebound (and expansion) of ride-share demand, profitable scaling of its delivery and logistics businesses, and new ways to monetize the platform through dynamic pricing, subscription offerings, and enterprise partnerships have all helped the stocks rally. At the same time, driver utilization and overall platform efficiency improved, which boosted unit economics. International market recoveries added another layer of growth, while Uber’s heavy investment in routing technology, machine learning, and bundling rides with delivery helped expand margins and strengthen market share against local rivals. 6. RTX (RTX)RTX, the aerospace and defense giant formerly known as Raytheon Technologies, has been steadily reshaping itself into a more focused industry leader. That transformation paid off in 2025. Global defense budgets remained elevated, aerospace supply chains continued to improve, and commercial aerospace services proved resilient—all of which fueled organic growth. RTX also leaned on its reliable aftermarket and services revenue, while operational efficiencies and selective divestitures helped strengthen margins. With strong free cash flow, the company was able to buy back stock and reduce debt—moves that reassured investors looking for balance sheet discipline during a year of economic uncertainty. 7. Broadcom (AVGO)Broadcom has built a unique business that combines its world-class semiconductor products with a fast-growing software portfolio. That mix gives the company both steady hardware revenue and recurring, high-margin software income—a rare balance in the tech world. In 2025, Broadcom saw strong demand for networking gear, data center connections, and broadband and AI infrastructure. On the software side, margins have been stable and predictable. Broadcom has also benefited handsomely from the growth in AI. 8. Nvidia (NVDA)Nvidia continued to dominate and remains a standout leader in the AI, Crypto, Graphics, and gaming space. Strong adoption of generative AI workloads across hyperscalers, enterprises, and cloud providers kept demand for Nvidia’s data-center GPUs extremely high. Nvidia is a great example of a leading stock that has been leading for years. If you look at a monthly chart of Nvidia, you’ll see a very impressive uptrend. There’s a strong chance this uptrend will continue as we head into Q4 2025 and beyond. 9. Goldman Sachs (GS)Goldman Sachs, one of the world’s most influential investment banks, stood out from its peers in 2025. The firm saw stronger investment banking activity, steady inflows into its asset-management arm, and solid trading revenues. A rebound in mergers, acquisitions, and capital markets deals—especially in key regions—helped boost results. Goldman also secured lucrative advisory work on corporate restructurings and strategic acquisitions. On top of that, tight expense control and smarter use of capital drove higher returns and profitability. Its growing consumer and private-wealth businesses added another layer of stability, helping smooth out earnings in what’s often a cyclical industry. 10. Philip Morris International (PM) Philip Morris International, best known for its iconic cigarette brands, has been reshaping itself into a broader smoke-free and nicotine-focused company. That transition gained real traction in 2025. The company’s heated tobacco and vaping products continued to win over consumers, driving growth even as traditional cigarette volumes declined. Strong demand for its IQOS platform and other reduced-risk products helped boost both revenue and margins. At the same time, Philip Morris managed costs tightly and generated solid cash flow, which supported dividends and buybacks—key priorities for investors. The result was a more balanced, forward-looking business model that’s less dependent on traditional tobacco sales. Key themes tying these names together Risks and watch points ConclusionThese are the 10 strongest performing mega cap stocks in 2025. For the most part, these companies are able to grow their earnings, revenue, and have predictable cash flow. While each stock carries company-specific risks, the ten strongest stocks in 2025 reflect the strongest mega cap stocks in 2025. Barring some unforeseen sell off, these stocks can continue to lead as we head into Q4 and beyond. Disclaimer: These are not buy ideas & no investment advice is being given.

In addition, you accept Insider’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Economic uncertainty lingers at the edge of markets, but it hasn't done much to dent the wild enthusiasm for AI in 2025. The frenzy is still mainly seen in the market's biggest stocks. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF is up 40% in six months, compared to a gain of 20% for the S&P 500 in that time. However, the rally is broadening, and other winners are emerging as the AI buildout accelerates. Analysts at Futurum Group, a market research and intelligence firm, flagged a list of stocks they see as most likely to outperform the most popular names in the next chapter of the AI boom. Here are five tech stocks it sees as the big winners as the rally extends beyond the Magnificent Seven. Ticker: AVGO Year-to-date gain: 43% Analyst's view: Futurum analysts describe Broadcom as the "Uncle Sam of AI," due to its ability to tax many aspects of AI inference, earning it the No. 1 spot on its ranking. "In a world where every AI token costs someone money, Broadcom isn't just supplying parts, but they are becoming the toll collector across silicon, networking, and software, taking a cut from every layer of the stack." Ticker: PLTR Year-to-date gain: 137% Analyst's view: While Palantir stock has stumbled in recent weeks, leading to a spike in bearish sentiment, Futurum's analysts aren't worried. "Palantir has emerged as the execution layer of AI, not selling models or dashboards but decision engines that fuse data, policy, and action across government, defense, and enterprise." Ticker: ORCL Year-to-date gain: 70% Analyst's view: One of the season's breakout tech stocks, Oracle has been in focus since a bullish revenue forecast sent shares surging. Futurum sees it as the core player in the industry, praising its strength as a fundamental enterprise AI provider. "Where others rent compute, Oracle ties it to data by being that structural edge as AI moves from prototype to production," the report said. "That edge is now scaled by numbers that rival hyperscalers." Ticker: NBIS Year-to-date gain: 295% Analyst's view: An unknown AI utility company until recently, Nebius stock surged on September 9 on news that it had inked a $17 billion deal with Microsoft, and Futurum sees the Netherlands-based company playing a pivotal role in the AI economy. "Nebius isn't competing with hyperscalers on breadth. It's competing on the physical and economic constraints that define AI compute: power, cooling, and integration." Ticker: MBD Year-to-date gain: 31% Analyst's view: Over the past two quarters, MongoDB stock has surged as Atlas, its enterprise platform, has helped drive significant revenue growth. Futurum highlighted the platform's ability to help large-scale companies simplify AI applications. "That evolution is why Mongo is winning critical workloads and why it's becoming the memory layer of AI, the bridge between messy enterprise data and agentic systems that require structured retrieval."

Title: Is the Big Business of AI Dominated by Too Few Big Businesses?

U.S. companies expect to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on AI over the next few years, but some investors are worried those plans—and the stock market rally they've fueled—depend too much on just a handful of companies. Chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) revealed in a regulatory filing last month that two direct customers accounted for nearly 40% of total revenue in the second quarter, with "Customer A" representing 23% of sales and "Customer B" 16%. At no other point since 2022, when ChatGPT sparked the AI craze, have two individual buyers represented a greater share of Nvidia’s sales. But experts note that the 40% figure likely overstates Nvidia's reliance on those two customers. Nvidia doesn't disclose who its customers are, but Customers A and B are likely distributors or system integrators that package Nvidia products in larger systems for sale to end users like hyperscalers and software companies. Nvidia has less visibility into how much of its revenue comes from the hyperscalers. In the most recent quarter, the company estimated that two unnamed end users each accounted for 10% or more of total revenue. Unless they each account for well over 10%, the estimate suggests Nvidia's pool of final users could be more diverse than its pool of direct customers. “Feast or famine,” is how Bill Kleyman, Senior Data Center Analyst at HostingAdvice, characterizes Nvidia’s sales. The company’s fortunes, Kleyman told Investopedia, “are increasingly tied to how much the big cloud platforms spend on AI infrastructure.” The artificial intelligence boom has helped the U.S. stock market and economy weather elevated inflation and interest rates for the past several years. A slowdown in spending by just a few major tech companies could shake investor confidence in AI, rattle the stock market, and detract from economic growth. Competitor Broadcom (AVGO) is in the same boat. One distributor accounted for nearly 30% of sales in the past two quarters, and Broadcom estimated that about 40% of revenue came from its five largest end users. Broadcom's sales have become more concentrated during the AI arms race of the past few years. Nonetheless, according to Kleyman, the unique dynamic of the AI infrastructure buildout makes this level of concentration less risky than it otherwise would be. “Overall AI demand is so strong across many sectors that a shortfall from one large customer would likely be offset by others ramping up their investments,” he said. Chipmakers aren’t the only companies in the AI supply chain that could be forced to grapple with the consequences of customer concentration. Enterprise software and cloud computing company Oracle (ORCL) reported earlier this month that its backlog swelled by nearly $320 billion in the most recent quarter. Shares soared as Wall Street hailed the “historic” quarter. But it quickly became apparent that nearly all of the backlog could be attributed to a 5-year, $300 billion cloud computing deal with OpenAI. The terms of the agreement are unknown, but experts say flexibility is always written into contracts of that size and duration. How much of Oracle's backlog is converted into revenue will depend on OpenAI’s usage, which hinges on factors beyond how much the public uses ChatGPT. “These deals are only as sticky as the models they serve,” says Rory Bokser, Head of Product at Moken.io, a decentralized computing network data provider. “If OpenAI changes architectures, moves off Oracle’s flavor of cloud, or pivots deployment strategy (edge vs. centralized), those ‘backlogs’ get revised real fast.” Another risk of inking a $300 billion deal with one company is that the customer may not have $300 billion to spend. OpenAI's annualized recurring revenue reportedly reached $12 billion in July, and the company is targeting $125 billion in revenue by 2029. Whether OpenAI hits those aggressive growth targets will likely depend on the ability of other companies to use its models to expand their profit margins or develop revenue-generating applications. Jabin Botsford /The Washington Post / Getty Images Without rapid revenue growth, OpenAI may need to lean on investors to supply it with the billions of dollars it expects to burn through by the end of the decade. A recent funding round put the company’s valuation at about $500 billion, making it one of the world’s most valuable private enterprises. “It remains to be seen whether or not OpenAI will continue to receive the lavish funding it has received so far,” said Greg Osuri, founder and CEO of Akash, a decentralized computing marketplace. Future funding could become scarce if AI implementation fails to live up to Wall Street's lofty expectations or economic stress forces investors and creditors to pull back.
