Title: What Happens When a Stock Is Dropped From the S&P 500?

Time Published: 2024-10-11T17:11:35Z

Being listed on the S&P 500 is a hallmark of success for many companies, symbolizing market leadership and investor confidence. However, it's not uncommon for companies to sometimes be delisted from this prestigious index. In fact, the average life span of a company on the S&P 500 is about 21 years. Delisting can occur for several reasons and may have immediate negative consequences for the company and its investors, affecting stock prices and market perceptions. Understanding what happens when a stock is delisted from the S&P 500 is crucial for investors and stakeholders. Read on to better understand the reasons behind delisting, its impact, and how recent examples shed light on this aspect of the stock market. The S&P 500, short for Standard & Poor's 500, is one of the most widely followed stock market indexes in the world. It represents the performance of 500 large companies listed on stock exchanges in the U.S. Along with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and the Nasdaq composite, the S&P 500 is considered one of the main benchmarks of the U.S. stock market's health and performance. The index is host to many of the world's most important companies and household names, including the following (by market cap weight as of the fourth quarter of 2024): The S&P 500 has specific criteria for including companies in the index. While the choice by S&P 500 about inclusion is more than just specific measures, these are the main thresholds a company must meet: The S&P 500 is not simply a list of the 500 largest companies by market capitalization. The inclusion process involves careful consideration by the index committee. They meet quarterly to review which companies to add or drop. The committee also monitors for significant developments (such as mergers, bankruptcies, or restructuring) that might affect index composition. While meeting the inclusion criteria is necessary, it doesn't guarantee being included. The committee has discretion when adding new companies. When adding or removing companies, the committee aims to decrease index turnover while ensuring the index represents the large-cap U.S. equity market. The index's composition changes are typically announced with several days' notice. This allows index funds and other market participants time to prepare for the change. Companies can be removed from the S&P 500 for various reasons, which we can broadly categorize into voluntary and involuntary delistings: Some companies delist themselves from the S&P 500 or other major indexes. Reasons for voluntary delisting include the following: More commonly, companies are involuntarily removed from the S&P 500 because of failing to meet the index's criteria. Reasons can include the following: When a stock is removed from the S&P 500, it typically has significant effects on the stock and its investors. Short-Term Consequences: Long-Term Consequences: Companies that fall out of the S&P 500 can be included again. For example, Dell was in the S&P 500 before going private in 2013. The company was relisted in the index Sept. 23, 2024, to mark its 40th anniversary. Being added to the S&P 500 is often a significant achievement for a company. It brings several benefits, many of which are the opposite of being removed from the index: Here are several of the major companies removed from the index in 2024: Whirlpool, a major U.S. manufacturer of home appliances, was removed from the S&P 500 index in early 2024. Reasons for delisting: Effects: The removal of American Airlines (AAL) from the S&P 500 in 2024 reflected broader challenges facing the airline industry and the company's specific financial struggles. Reasons for delisting: Effects: The removal of Etsy Inc. (ETSY) from the S&P 500 was driven by changes in consumer behavior and ever more competition in ecommerce. Reasons for delisting: Effects: Other companies removed from the S&P 500 in 2024 include the following firms: As companies are moved out of the S&P 500 index, new companies are added to take their place. In 2024, the following were some of those added: You don't get your money back when a stock is removed from the index. You still own the same number of shares in the company. However, the value of those shares may decrease, and it may become more difficult to sell them. Index funds are mutual and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the performance of a specific market index, such as the S&P 500. It provides investors with broad market exposure and typically offers lower fees than actively managed funds, as it simply mimics the composition of the chosen index rather than trying to outperform it. This depends on your investment strategy and the specific circumstances of the stock's removal. Stock prices are often negatively affected following its removal. In any case, it's important to reassess the company's fundamentals and prospects. Consult with a financial advisor for personalized advice if needed. Being delisted from the S&P 500 is a significant event for any company, often leading to immediate and negative consequences, such as a drop in stock price and reduced visibility. It can be voluntary because of a merger, going private, a falling market cap, or not meeting other index criteria. However, it's important to remember that delisting doesn't necessarily mean a company is doomed to fail. Some companies use this as a chance to restructure, refocus, and potentially return more robust than before. For investors, a stock's delisting from the S&P 500 should prompt a careful reassessment of the investment.

Benzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. Ltd. (NYSE:TSM) and Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) are currently competing for a seat at an elite table: The exclusive trillion-dollar club. Taiwan Semiconductorâ€™s market cap first crossed the trillion-dollar threshold in July. It has since contracted to roughly $820 billion â€” a stoneâ€™s throw away from Broadcomâ€™s $867 billion. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) are among the clubâ€™s current members after their market caps exceeded a trillion dollars, fueled by AI advancements.

Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing. Your biggest returns may not come from the stock market. Invest the way colleges, pension funds, and the 1% do. Get started investing in commercial real estate today. With TSM and Broadcom both driving critical innovations in AI semiconductors, we ask: Which companyâ€™s market cap will attain nine zeros next? Taiwan Semiconductor stands as the world's largest contract chipmaker, leading the market with its 3nm and 5nm technology. These chips are integral for AI workloads, fueling AI giants like Nvidia and Apple. This has propelled TSM's stock by over 83.3% year-to-date and 105.39% in the past year. Analysts from Needham and Susquehanna maintain Overweight ratings, with an average price target of $236.67, implying 27.15% upside. A price at that level would push TSM's market cap to over $1.23 trillion, positioning it to re-join the trillion-dollar club. Technically, TSMC is also in a bullish trend with buying pressure across its eight, 20, 50 and 200-day moving averages, all signaling continued upward momentum. TSMâ€™s stock currently trades at $186.33, supported by a simple moving average, or SMA, (50-day) of $170.55 and a SMA (200-day) of $149.54, indicating positive technical indicators.

Carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fundrise Flagship Fund before investing. This and other information can be found in the Fund's prospectus. Read them carefully before investing. Broadcom is capitalizing on the AI boom through its extensive semiconductor solutions for data centers, networking infrastructure, and real-time analytics. Its stock is up 69.28% year-to-date and 114.05% in the past year. Despite bullish ratings, its projected upside falls short of TSM. Analysts from Cantor Fitzgerald, Truist Securities, and UBS see AVGO reaching $200, implying an 8.80% upside, which would push its market cap to $934 billion. Technically, Broadcom is also trending positively, with its current price of $184.40 supported by moving averages, such as its 50-day SMA of $161.82 and 200-day SMA of $142.55. However, it still lags behind TSM's stronger growth trajectory. While both stocks are positioned to benefit from AI, TSMC has the edge, with superior technical indicators and greater market cap potential. With an imminent leap toward $1.23 trillion in market cap if it meets analystsâ€™ upside potential, TSM appears more likely to reach the trillion-dollar club before Broadcom.
