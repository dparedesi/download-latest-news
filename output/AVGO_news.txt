Economic uncertainty lingers at the edge of markets, but it hasn't done much to dent the wild enthusiasm for AI in 2025. The frenzy is still mainly seen in the market's biggest stocks. The Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF is up 40% in six months, compared to a gain of 20% for the S&P 500 in that time. However, the rally is broadening, and other winners are emerging as the AI buildout accelerates. Analysts at Futurum Group, a market research and intelligence firm, flagged a list of stocks they see as most likely to outperform the most popular names in the next chapter of the AI boom. Here are five tech stocks it sees as the big winners as the rally extends beyond the Magnificent Seven. Ticker: AVGO Year-to-date gain: 43% Analyst's view: Futurum analysts describe Broadcom as the "Uncle Sam of AI," due to its ability to tax many aspects of AI inference, earning it the No. 1 spot on its ranking. "In a world where every AI token costs someone money, Broadcom isn't just supplying parts, but they are becoming the toll collector across silicon, networking, and software, taking a cut from every layer of the stack." Ticker: PLTR Year-to-date gain: 137% Analyst's view: While Palantir stock has stumbled in recent weeks, leading to a spike in bearish sentiment, Futurum's analysts aren't worried. "Palantir has emerged as the execution layer of AI, not selling models or dashboards but decision engines that fuse data, policy, and action across government, defense, and enterprise." Ticker: ORCL Year-to-date gain: 70% Analyst's view: One of the season's breakout tech stocks, Oracle has been in focus since a bullish revenue forecast sent shares surging. Futurum sees it as the core player in the industry, praising its strength as a fundamental enterprise AI provider. "Where others rent compute, Oracle ties it to data by being that structural edge as AI moves from prototype to production," the report said. "That edge is now scaled by numbers that rival hyperscalers." Ticker: NBIS Year-to-date gain: 295% Analyst's view: An unknown AI utility company until recently, Nebius stock surged on September 9 on news that it had inked a $17 billion deal with Microsoft, and Futurum sees the Netherlands-based company playing a pivotal role in the AI economy. "Nebius isn't competing with hyperscalers on breadth. It's competing on the physical and economic constraints that define AI compute: power, cooling, and integration." Ticker: MBD Year-to-date gain: 31% Analyst's view: Over the past two quarters, MongoDB stock has surged as Atlas, its enterprise platform, has helped drive significant revenue growth. Futurum highlighted the platform's ability to help large-scale companies simplify AI applications. "That evolution is why Mongo is winning critical workloads and why it's becoming the memory layer of AI, the bridge between messy enterprise data and agentic systems that require structured retrieval."

Title: Is the Big Business of AI Dominated by Too Few Big Businesses?

U.S. companies expect to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on AI over the next few years, but some investors are worried those plans—and the stock market rally they've fueled—depend too much on just a handful of companies. Chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) revealed in a regulatory filing last month that two direct customers accounted for nearly 40% of total revenue in the second quarter, with "Customer A" representing 23% of sales and "Customer B" 16%. At no other point since 2022, when ChatGPT sparked the AI craze, have two individual buyers represented a greater share of Nvidia’s sales. But experts note that the 40% figure likely overstates Nvidia's reliance on those two customers. Nvidia doesn't disclose who its customers are, but Customers A and B are likely distributors or system integrators that package Nvidia products in larger systems for sale to end users like hyperscalers and software companies. Nvidia has less visibility into how much of its revenue comes from the hyperscalers. In the most recent quarter, the company estimated that two unnamed end users each accounted for 10% or more of total revenue. Unless they each account for well over 10%, the estimate suggests Nvidia's pool of final users could be more diverse than its pool of direct customers. “Feast or famine,” is how Bill Kleyman, Senior Data Center Analyst at HostingAdvice, characterizes Nvidia’s sales. The company’s fortunes, Kleyman told Investopedia, “are increasingly tied to how much the big cloud platforms spend on AI infrastructure.” The artificial intelligence boom has helped the U.S. stock market and economy weather elevated inflation and interest rates for the past several years. A slowdown in spending by just a few major tech companies could shake investor confidence in AI, rattle the stock market, and detract from economic growth. Competitor Broadcom (AVGO) is in the same boat. One distributor accounted for nearly 30% of sales in the past two quarters, and Broadcom estimated that about 40% of revenue came from its five largest end users. Broadcom's sales have become more concentrated during the AI arms race of the past few years. Nonetheless, according to Kleyman, the unique dynamic of the AI infrastructure buildout makes this level of concentration less risky than it otherwise would be. “Overall AI demand is so strong across many sectors that a shortfall from one large customer would likely be offset by others ramping up their investments,” he said. Chipmakers aren’t the only companies in the AI supply chain that could be forced to grapple with the consequences of customer concentration. Enterprise software and cloud computing company Oracle (ORCL) reported earlier this month that its backlog swelled by nearly $320 billion in the most recent quarter. Shares soared as Wall Street hailed the “historic” quarter. But it quickly became apparent that nearly all of the backlog could be attributed to a 5-year, $300 billion cloud computing deal with OpenAI. The terms of the agreement are unknown, but experts say flexibility is always written into contracts of that size and duration. How much of Oracle's backlog is converted into revenue will depend on OpenAI’s usage, which hinges on factors beyond how much the public uses ChatGPT. “These deals are only as sticky as the models they serve,” says Rory Bokser, Head of Product at Moken.io, a decentralized computing network data provider. “If OpenAI changes architectures, moves off Oracle’s flavor of cloud, or pivots deployment strategy (edge vs. centralized), those ‘backlogs’ get revised real fast.” Another risk of inking a $300 billion deal with one company is that the customer may not have $300 billion to spend. OpenAI's annualized recurring revenue reportedly reached $12 billion in July, and the company is targeting $125 billion in revenue by 2029. Whether OpenAI hits those aggressive growth targets will likely depend on the ability of other companies to use its models to expand their profit margins or develop revenue-generating applications. Jabin Botsford /The Washington Post / Getty Images Without rapid revenue growth, OpenAI may need to lean on investors to supply it with the billions of dollars it expects to burn through by the end of the decade. A recent funding round put the company’s valuation at about $500 billion, making it one of the world’s most valuable private enterprises. “It remains to be seen whether or not OpenAI will continue to receive the lavish funding it has received so far,” said Greg Osuri, founder and CEO of Akash, a decentralized computing marketplace. Future funding could become scarce if AI implementation fails to live up to Wall Street's lofty expectations or economic stress forces investors and creditors to pull back.
