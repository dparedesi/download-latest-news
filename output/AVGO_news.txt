Title: This Stock Market Bubble Is Not Real (This 8% Dividend Proves It)

ByMichael Foster, Contributor. Are we in a stock market bubble or not? Let’s tackle that question head-on, because it’s all we seem to be hearing about these days. I’ll put my cards on the table: We’re not in a bubble. I’m going to show you why I’m still bullish on stocks at these levels. Then we’re going to play overwrought bubble fears with a “cornerstone” fund that’s beaten stocks over just about every timeline but is still cheap (and yields a rich 8%, too). When it comes to stocks, the truth is, there’s a good reason why they keep rising: We’re in a booming economy. Of course, you might not feel that way—many communities across America are suffering. Income inequality, crime, corruption—it’s a mess out there. Those are all serious problems, to be sure. But just as the stock market is not the economy, the stock market is not society, either, and those problems can co-exist with a rising market. Stocks are rising because their moves are tied to one thing: earnings. And earnings are soaring. Bloomberg recently reported on something we’ve been talking about for a while here at Contrarian Outlook and in my CEF Insider service: Earnings are growing as companies improve their profits through efficiency gains, some of which are driven by AI. In fact, the earnings beats we’re seeing come from across the economy, from companies as diverse as General Motors (GM), Coca-Cola (KO), Morgan Stanley (MS) and, of course, tech names like Broadcom (AVGO) and Lam Research (LRCX). While tech continues to be the top-performing sector, there’s good reason to expect that more and more gains will come from outside of tech, as new innovations spread from that sector into other parts of the economy. This doesn’t mean we should simply avoid tech and buy the rest of the market. After all, tech’s earnings gains are the strongest out there and will likely remain so, although financials are a close second. At a time like this, we want broad-based market exposure. But of course, as my CEF Insider members know, we do not want an index fund. Their paltry 1% yields are just plain unacceptable to us income investors. Instead, we’re going with a closed-end fund (CEF) that invests in a broad range of S&P 500 stocks, but with a key difference: This one pays a rich 8% yield. That would be the Adams Diversified Equity Fund (ADX), which holds tech darlings like Broadcom, as well as top performers from other sectors, like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM). Thanks to its well-crafted portfolio, ADX hasn’t just matched the stock market’s returns over the last decade—it’s beaten it. This is why, at CEF Insider, we’ve been holding ADX for almost the entire time shown on this chart (and we would’ve held it for the entire time if CEF Insider had launched in 2015, rather than in 2017). This outperformance is great—but so is the dividend. ADX has yielded around 9.5% over the last decade, thanks to the huge special payouts management issued at year-end. But in 2024, the fund changed its distribution plans, going with a more evenly spread payout tied to the fund’s net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio). Now, ADX’s regular distributions are more consistent and reliable. The fund pays about 8% now, largely because the stock price is up over 13% in 2025 (as prices rise, yields fall). But its total return including dividends is 21.7% for the year, as of this writing, again far ahead of the S&P 500, at 16.6%. In other words, this fund has outperformed over the short and the long term. Yet it still trades at a discount to NAV. ADX’s discount is now 8.3%, but it was over 10% at the start of the year (and was around 12% most of the time before that). With the fund’s high yield, market outperformance and smartly built portfolio, this discount is likely to disappear, especially as more money comes into stocks as bubble fears fade. If you buy ADX today, you can still lock in this discount, boosting your upside potential while also securing that healthy yield. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: Broadcom Vs Nvidia: Which Stock Could Rally?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Despite Broadcom climbing 13% in the last week, its competitor Nvidia might be a more attractive option. Regularly assessing alternatives is fundamental to a solid investment strategy. Nvidia (NVDA) stock displays better revenue growth over significant periods, greater profitability, and a relatively lower valuation compared to Broadcom (AVGO) stock, indicating that investing in NVDA may be advantageous. Nvidia’s vertically integrated platform, including its cutting-edge Blackwell GPUs, NVLink interconnects, and proprietary CUDA software stack make it indispensable for AI data centers needing massive parallel processing power. In comparison, Broadcom’s custom silicon (ASICs) and AI networking solutions serve specific client needs through long-term contracts, representing a potentially lower long term growth model. Quiz time: Over the past 5 years, which index do you believe the Trefis High Quality Portfolio outperformed—the S&P 500, S&P 1500 Equal Weighted, or both? The answer might surprise you. Discover how our advisory framework increases your chances of success. AVGO designs and provides semiconductor devices and infrastructure software, offering solutions such as set-top box system-on-chips, cable, DSL, and passive optical networking. NVDA delivers graphics, computing, and networking solutions for gaming, visualization, data centers, and automotive markets. Valuation & Performance Overview Note: For “Last 3 Year Return” metric, the preferred stock is the one with higher returns unless the returns are exceedingly high (>300%), which poses a risk of sell-off. See more revenue details: AVGO Revenue Comparison | NVDA Revenue ComparisonSee more margin details: AVGO Operating Income Comparison | NVDA Operating Income Comparison But do these figures capture the complete picture? Read Buy or Sell NVDA Stock to determine whether NVIDIA’s advantage holds under scrutiny or if Broadcom still has a role to play (see Buy or Sell AVGO Stock).

Title: Is AVGO Stock Beating Competition?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Broadcom stock (NASDAQ: AVGO) has soared 13% in a week, driven by significant momentum in the AI sector. This surge is fueled by two major catalysts: Given this dramatic 13% increase, it is a fundamental part of a robust investment strategy to re-evaluate the stock’s position. Below is a comparison of Broadcom against its peers, focusing on key financial metrics such as size, valuation, growth, and margin. For some context, Broadcom delivers semiconductor devices and infrastructure software, which includes set-top box system-on-chips, cable, DSL, and passive optical networking solutions. That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock like AVGO, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Why does this matter? AVGO recently rose by 17% in a month – a peer comparison places stock performance, valuation, and financials in a broader context – indicating whether it is genuinely outperforming, lagging behind, and ultimately – can this trend continue? Read Buy or Sell AVGO Stock to determine if Broadcom stands as a solid investment. Additionally, there is always a possibility of a decline following a significant rally – observe how the stock has historically dipped and recovered through AVGO Dip Buyer Analysis perspective. Investing in a single stock without comprehensive analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Did You Miss Broadcom Stock’s $51 Billion Payout?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/29/did-you-miss-broadcom-stocks-51-billion-payout/
Time Published: 2025-10-29T13:07:05Z

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Over the past decade, Broadcom stock (NASDAQ: AVGO) has delivered a significant $51 billion back to its shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. This extraordinary cash generation stems from Broadcom's position as a dominant supplier of mission-critical semiconductor chips and infrastructure software, where the company operates in markets with exceptionally high barriers to entry and generates industry-leading margins that convert revenue into pure cash flow. Broadcom’s cash machine operates on two highly profitable pillars: its semiconductor solutions business that generates $34 billion (LTM) with products so essential to data center, networking, and mobile infrastructure, and its infrastructure software division producing $26 billion through mission-critical enterprise software, including VMware's virtualization platform that customers rely on for their core operations. The company’s business model is particularly cash-generative because it focuses on high-margin, recurring revenue streams, allowing Broadcom to convert approximately $24+ billion annually into free cash flow from its $51.6 billion revenue base. Let's examine some statistics and see how this cash return capability compares to the largest capital-return companies in the market. Interestingly, AVGO stock ranks as the 53rd highest for total returns to shareholders in history. Why should this matter to you? Because dividends and stock buybacks provide direct, tangible returns of capital to shareholders. They also indicate management’s confidence in the company’s fiscal health and capability to generate sustainable cash inflows. Additionally, there are numerous other stocks like this. Here’s a list of the top 10 companies ranked by total capital returned to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases. For comprehensive rankings, visit Buybacks & Dividends Ranking What do you observe here? The total amount of capital returned to shareholders as a percentage of the current market capitalization seems inversely related to growth expectations for reinvestment opportunities. Companies like Meta Platforms (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) are experiencing significantly faster growth, more predictably when compared to their counterparts, but have returned a much smaller proportion of their market cap to shareholders. This represents the downside of high capital returns. Certainly, they are appealing, but you need to ask yourself: Am I compromising on growth and solid fundamentals? Keeping this in mind, let’s review some data for AVGO. (Refer to Buy or Sell Broadcom Stock for more insight) That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. That said, AVGO is not immune to significant downturns. It experienced a nearly 48% drop during the COVID-19 pandemic, around 35% during the 2021 inflation shock, and approximately 27% during the 2018 correction. See – How Low Can Broadcom Stock Go – for more details. Even with robust fundamentals, it is evident that the stock can undergo substantial declines when market conditions change. Quality companies still suffer when market sentiment shifts abruptly. However, the risk isn't confined to major market crashes. Stocks can decline even in favorable market conditions — consider circumstances like earnings reports, business announcements, and changes in forecasts. Check AVGO Dip Buyer Analyses to explore how the stock has rebounded from sharp declines historically. Remember, investing in a single stock without comprehensive analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.
