Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime. In a period marked by investor caution in the U.S. tech sector, Broadcom Inc. AVGO stands out with a 63% stock rally in just three months. Let’s unpack the compelling narrative behind Broadcom’s exceptional outperformance, delving into its strong second-quarter 2025 results, positive analyst sentiment, and future outlook. Broadcom, a dominant force in the Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) market, focuses on high-performance computing, networking, and storage applications. The company designs and manufactures custom silicon chips for specific tasks, offering high-speed computing, networking, and data center infrastructure advantages. Broadcom’s stock increased by 63% in the last three months, while the PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index (SOX), which includes Broadcom, gained 30% during the same period.

Currently, AVGO trades near its 52-week high of approximately $276. Analysts generally hold a positive outlook on Broadcom, with a consensus price forecast of $387.68 based on ratings from 29 analysts. The highest target is $1950, issued by Bernstein on June 13, 2024. The three most recent analyst ratings were released by Citigroup, Barclays, and Susquehanna in June 2025. Broadcom’s second-quarter 2025 revenue reached $15 billion, a 20% increase year-over-year, driven by its AI semiconductor solutions and VMware. This revenue figure slightly exceeded analyst estimates of $14.99 billion. The company’s quarterly AI revenue grew 46% to over $4.4 billion, attributed to demand for AI networking. Broadcom generated approximately $6.56 billion in cash from operations and $6.41 billion in free cash flow during the quarter. Adjusted earnings for the second quarter were $1.58 per share, surpassing analyst estimates of $1.56. For the third quarter, Broadcom expects revenue of approximately $15.8 billion, aligning with estimates of $15.79 billion. It anticipates AI semiconductor revenue to reach $5.1 billion in the third quarter. These results prompted analysts to adjust price targets for the stock, citing growth in AI-related revenue and demand for networking solutions. JP Morgan’s Harlan Sur noted Broadcom’s potential for long-term AI revenue growth, supported by increased capital expenditures from major cloud firms and the adoption of its custom ASIC silicon. Rosenblatt’s Kevin Cassidy highlighted Broadcom’s visibility into AI growth through key XPU customers and the company’s Ethernet scale-up adoption for LLM training and inference. Cantor Fitzgerald’s Matthew Prisco projects AI semiconductor revenue to exceed $20 billion in 2025 and $30 billion in 2026. Broadcom’s stock has dramatically outpaced its peers, with a 68% surge over the last 12 months compared to the PHLX Semiconductor’s modest 1.3%. In the first half of 2025, Broadcom gained 19% outpacing the S&P 500 gain of 6% and Nasdaq’s 15.5%. The year 2024 was particularly significant, as Broadcom joined the exclusive “trillion-dollar valuation club,” alongside Nvidia Corp. NVDA, fueled by the intensifying AI frenzy. In fiscal year 2024, Broadcom’s revenue reached an impressive $51.6 billion, marking a 44% increase. Semiconductor revenue contributed $30.1 billion, with AI revenue alone soaring 220% to $12.2 billion, driven by its AI XPUs and Ethernet networking portfolio. The integration of VMware significantly boosted infrastructure software revenue to $21.5 billion. The company also notably doubled its AI XPU shipments to hyperscale customers. Despite a significant reliance on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. TSM for nearly 95% of its wafers in fiscal 2024, Broadcom maintained a substantial 64% gross margin, showcasing its strong pricing power and market position. Broadcom CEO Hock Tan expressed strong confidence in December last year, stating that the company could generate tens of billions in annual AI chip revenue by 2027, driven by increasing demand from prominent AI developers like OpenAI and xAI. Analysts echo this optimism. JP Morgan’s Harlan Sur noted that Broadcom has secured multi-year AI ASIC deals with OpenAI and a fifth major client, estimating a $150 billion AI semiconductor opportunity through 2029. BofA Securities’ Vivek Arya believes ASICs could capture 10-15% of the AI accelerator market, supporting Broadcom’s growth even as Nvidia retains a significant market share. Price Action: AVGO stock is trading lower by 0.25% to $274.94 premarket at last check Tuesday.

ByMoneyShow ByMoneyShow, Contributor. Big Tech is back in the driver’s seat! The technology sector has been leading the market rally off the early-April lows – with sizable double-digit gains piling up. Here are three ways you can profit, courtesy of top MoneyShow experts. Mike Larson MoneyShow.com Big Tech is SO back. Again. Ever since the stock market bottomed out on April 7, we’ve seen most (though not ALL) of the biggest technology stocks rocket higher. All but two are outperforming smaller-capitalization stocks, as represented by the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM), as well as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) -- as you can see in this MoneyShow Chart of the Day. Big Tech SPY IWM Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) is the Big Tech name with the most post-“Liberation Day” juice – up 58%. Tesla Inc. (TSLA) isn’t far behind, with a 40.4% rally. Next are Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and Meta Platforms Inc. (META), both nipping at Tesla’s heels with gains of 37.8% and 37.3%. Only Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) are notably lagging (+11.2% and +16.4%, respectively). What’s behind the resumption of the Big Tech trade – a trade that has periodically popped back up over the past year or two? A few things... First, investors are boosting bets on earlier Federal Reserve rate cuts. Lower rates help boost growth-stock multiples. Second, concerns about tariff and trade policy have eased. President Trump has dialed backed some of his most punitive tariffs – and signaled a willingness to keep negotiating with trade partners. That could prevent some of the worst-case tech supply chain scenarios from playing out. Third, FOMO is back in play. Investors got too bearish during the declines, didn’t get on board early enough in the subsequent rally, and they’re now dog-piling into old favorites to play catch up. Add it all up and you have a tech sector that is leading again – and driving the averages to new highs. From where I sit, that’s bullish…and underscores why my “Be (Selectively) Bold” approach (still) looks like the right one here. Joe Markman Digital Creators & Consumers It’s happening in real-time, yet most investors remain completely oblivious. The “it” is the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution, the greatest productivity accelerant since electricity. Let’s talk about what it means for Microsoft Corp. (MSFT). According to a report on Bloomberg, MSFT is planning to cut thousands of jobs in its Xbox gaming division. These cuts will be in addition to the 6,000 employees fired in May at LinkedIn and other Microsoft subsidiaries. This is a sticky subject. There is going to be massive disruption. But it is a wonderful time to be a Microsoft shareholder. Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) Analysts scoffed at Magnificent Seven corporate leaders when they kept increasing capital expenditures for AI infrastructure. Research suggested that the companies would never earn a return on that invested capital because they couldn’t imagine a large-enough business to justify the investment. When Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s chief executive, invested $10 billion in OpenAI two years ago, Wall Street analysts thought he had lost his mind. There was no demand for another Siri, they wrote. What the analysts missed then is that ChatGPT, OpenAI’s flagship product, isn’t Siri. ChatGPT can write software code, while Siri can barely play songs on Apple Music. Apple Inc.’s (AAPL) digital assistant was never going to succeed, mostly due to corporate culture. The iPhone maker is a hardware company. But executives at the other Mag-7 companies live and breathe software. They understood immediately what ChatGPT was, and they went all-in on AI. Make no mistake: layoffs at the biggest software companies are about to become much more common. This is because large portions of software employees can be replaced with AI. In the same way that electricity enabled mechanized, automated production that required fewer workers to achieve greater output, AI software is going to hollow out large parts of white-collar work. These changes will happen swiftly and persistently, as they are now occurring at Microsoft. In the past, foundational technology shifts have led to greater employment as new sectors and businesses were born. Pessimists said the Internet was going to shutter the global economy. More than two decades later, it turns out that connecting the entire world to a network led to millions of new jobs in the digital economy and employment in business verticals that previously did not exist. The flip side for investors is that productivity means increased profits. When headcounts are lower, more money flows to the bottom line. None of this is being reflected currently in share price valuations. Expect this to change in the second half of 2025 as hyperscalers talk about doing more with less, much to the surprise of the Wall Street analyst community. Recommended Action: Buy MSFT. George Gilder Gilder’s Technology Report The market capitalization leaderboard for semiconductors continues to highlight the divergence between IP ownership and physical production. US firms dominate the top rankings — Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) at $2.476 trillion, Broadcom Inc. (AVGO) at $804 billion — but that masks how irreplaceable the manufacturing layer has become in a geopolitically fractured world. Key fabrication and tooling players like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM), Samsung, and ASML Holding NV (ASML) remain undervalued by comparison. This valuation gap reflects investor focus on scalability and software leverage. Top 10 Semiconductors In today’s semiconductor market, location defines exposure, not necessarily strength. Nvidia, Broadcom, and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (AMD) — all US-headquartered — are rewarded for their innovation, commanding premium valuations and massive market capitalizations. But their products are inseparable from the Asian manufacturing ecosystem. TSMC, Samsung, and ASML remain irreplaceable at the physical layer of chip production. Tariffs, meanwhile, distort incentives. They penalize final assembly hubs like China without reshoring critical stages such as wafer fabrication or back-end packaging. This imbalance creates investment opportunities — and risks. US design-centric firms gain margin leverage, but companies controlling equipment, lithography, or memory — like ASML, Applied Materials, and SK Hynix — are the real backbone of global production. Investors should pay close attention to companies bridging these two worlds: Those that own irreplaceable manufacturing capacity and are structurally tied to Western markets. ASML and TSM remain critical infrastructure. Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT), Lam Research Corp. (LRCX), and KLA Corp. (KLAC) control the tools that keep fabs alive. Nvidia and Broadcom may lead the stock market — but it’s the factory floor that decides who can actually deliver.

Title: AVGO Stock To $500?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CANADA - 2025/01/28: In this photo illustration, the Broadcom logo is seen displayed on a smartphone ... More screen. (Photo Illustration by Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Broadcom’s (NASDAQ: AVGO) extraordinary 125% increase from $110 levels in early 2024 has investors pondering if the AI chipmaker can replicate its success. What might lead the stock to rise to $500+ levels from here in the coming years? The most persuasive factor is Broadcom’s custom silicon division. AI-related semiconductors now account for over 50% of Broadcom’s sales, marking a significant shift in the company’s revenue composition. The management of the company assesses the serviceable addressable market at $15-20 billion. The custom chip sector shows tremendous growth potential. The overall market for custom chips could expand to approximately $55 billion by 2028, effectively more than tripling from current figures. This growth reflects hyperscalers’ increasing preference for purpose-built silicon over generalized processors. Additionally, if you’re seeking a more consistent route to gains than investing in a single stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has surpassed the S&P and yielded over 91% since its inception. Also, check out – BigBear.ai: What's Happening With BBAI Stock? Other elements are at play as well. Broadcom's impressive earnings growth can support elevated valuations. The company's revenue is anticipated to grow at a high teens average annual rate to over $100 billion by 2029. Broadcom has high profitability with its adjusted net income margin of 50% in the past twelve months. This indicates that the impact on earnings will be more significant than on the top-line. At its present levels of $265, AVGO stock is trading at 45 times its trailing twelve months adjusted earnings of $5.84 per share. Additionally, check out – Broadcom’s Valuation Ratios. Maintaining this multiple could push the stock to around $500 within that timeframe. A higher multiple would enable an even greater increase. The existing customer relationships frequently involve multi-year commitments and substantial switching costs, which provides Broadcom with revenue visibility and pricing power, potentially maintaining premium valuations. For this multiple to broaden, Broadcom must showcase sustained strong annual revenue growth in AI segments, expand its market share in the custom silicon sector, focus on further margin improvement from a higher-value product mix, and secure contracts with new clients. In summary, Broadcom’s journey to doubling relies on capturing a significant portion of the growing custom chip market while preserving its technological prowess in AI networking. With the custom chip market potentially reaching $55 billion by 2028 and Broadcom’s current leading position, the company seems well-equipped for ongoing outperformance. While Broadcom displays strong growth prospects, several factors could restrict its upside. Consequently, investors considering Broadcom should carefully evaluate these risks. At Trefis, we incorporate such risks into our construction of the High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which encompasses 30 stocks and has consistently outperformed the S&P 500 over the last four years. What explains that outperformance? HQ Portfolio constituents tend to provide higher returns with lower volatility than the benchmark, as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
