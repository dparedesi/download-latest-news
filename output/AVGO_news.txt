Title: Could Broadcom Be In Trouble?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Broadcom stock (NASDAQ: AVGO) has a historical pattern of vulnerability to sharp downturns. On two separate occasions in past years, the stock dropped by over 30% in less than two months, wiping out billions in market capitalization and quickly erasing significant investor gains. If this historical volatility is any indicator, AVGO stock remains susceptible to abrupt, steep declines. Several brewing risks could fuel future volatility in Broadcom's share price: That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock like AVGO, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. It certainly helps alleviate risk when the fundamentals are positive. For more details on AVGO, read Buy or Sell AVGO Stock. Below are several important figures. *LTM: Last Twelve Months When assessing risk, it is beneficial to observe how AVGO performs during significant market pullbacks. In 2018, the stock experienced a decline of approximately 27% from peak to trough. The COVID-19 pandemic affected it more severely, resulting in a nearly 48% drop. During the inflation crisis, the decrease was around 35%. See – How Low Can Broadcom Stock Really Go – for more details. Even with solid fundamentals, AVGO remains vulnerable to sharp declines when the broader market drops. Strong quality can help soften the fall, but downturns are still painful. However, risks are not confined to significant market crashes. Stocks may decline even when markets are performing well – consider events like earnings reports, corporate announcements, and changes in outlook. Read AVGO Dip Buyer Analyses to learn how the stock has rebounded from significant declines in history. Remember, investing in a single stock without comprehensive analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

Skip to comments. Posted on 10/21/2025 8:51:43 AM PDT by SunkenCiv Names across the A.I. space rallied Monday on the back of Nvidia (NVDA) unveiling its first Blackwell wafer produced at TSMC's (TSM) Phoenix plant. Austin Lyons lays out where he sees the state of A.I. heading as demand sees no sign of slowing down. He believes increased competition in AMD Inc. (AMD) and Broadcom (AVGO) won't steal much of Nvidia's market share but will open the door to new chipmaking processes. As for A.I.'s next leg, Austin talks about the importance of data centers and energy as A.I. tech becomes more advanced. AMD & AVGO's Room to Take NVDA Market Share as A.I.

The AI came along created massive and largely unanticipated demand for that market niche. Nvida will have to work hard to keep their market dominance as legacy players like Intel get in the game to develop advanced products for the market. Intel has made a lot of missteps and it has been crippled by it's own success by focusing on selling premium priced derivatives of massive installed base of chips and it has missed the market on emerging advanced chip applications that would have cannibalized sales of it's premium bread and butter chips. . IIn a world where the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, Intel has fallen behind the rich getting richer crew but they still have lot of good technology and it would be a mistake to rule them out if they get their act together. Other players like AMD are still in game with products that are less than a generation behind Nvida and they are behind primarily as a conscious business decision based on market position for a lower performance, lower cost, higher volume segment of the market. The rapid explosion in AI in such a short time has caught them by surprise but it's not unreasonable to assume that they can quickly catch up if they choose to focus on the very high performance, AI driven segment of the market. Nvida is a relatively young company that has made it's way with aggressive implementation of a specialized technology. They do not yet have the full range of resources that some of their competition has. This could be a hindrance or an advantage so it is going to be interesting to see how things shake out in the AI world.

Hopefully this will cut nVidia’s extremely ridiculous prices down within our stratosphere. AMD stock went from about $164 on Oct 3rd to today at $238 AMD deal with OpenAI predict $600 a share maybe in 4 years... 😁 I’ve had 2 ATI Radeon in the past 20 years, and they both failed within a week. I haven’t had one since AMD took it over, but if nVidia won’t drop their prices to a reasonable level, I may have to try again with Radeon. As for motherboards, the last Intel I had was in 1998, when I first got to Japan, since was the only one available at the time. I only build my computers with AMD motherboards and CPUs.
