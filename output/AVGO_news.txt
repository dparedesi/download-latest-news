Wall Street is back in rally mode. The US stock market today is surging as investors cheer signs of a possible Trump-Xi trade deal. Dow futures are up 250 points. S&P 500 and Nasdaq are both higher — and traders are betting on a major Fed rate cut this week. Markets are now turning their focus to Trump’s high-stakes Asia trip. He’s set to meet China’s President Xi on Thursday, and early talks hint at “a substantial framework” for an agreement, according to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Across Asia, stocks are exploding higher. Japan’s Nikkei 225 smashed through 50,000 for the first time ever. Kospi, Hang Seng, and Shanghai Composite are all in the green.

Title: Could Broadcom Be In Trouble?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/10/23/could-broadcom-be-in-trouble/

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Broadcom stock (NASDAQ: AVGO) has a historical pattern of vulnerability to sharp downturns. On two separate occasions in past years, the stock dropped by over 30% in less than two months, wiping out billions in market capitalization and quickly erasing significant investor gains. If this historical volatility is any indicator, AVGO stock remains susceptible to abrupt, steep declines. Several brewing risks could fuel future volatility in Broadcom's share price: That being said, if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock like AVGO, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 105% since its inception. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. It certainly helps alleviate risk when the fundamentals are positive. For more details on AVGO, read Buy or Sell AVGO Stock. Below are several important figures. *LTM: Last Twelve Months When assessing risk, it is beneficial to observe how AVGO performs during significant market pullbacks. In 2018, the stock experienced a decline of approximately 27% from peak to trough. The COVID-19 pandemic affected it more severely, resulting in a nearly 48% drop. During the inflation crisis, the decrease was around 35%. See – How Low Can Broadcom Stock Really Go – for more details. Even with solid fundamentals, AVGO remains vulnerable to sharp declines when the broader market drops. Strong quality can help soften the fall, but downturns are still painful. However, risks are not confined to significant market crashes. Stocks may decline even when markets are performing well – consider events like earnings reports, corporate announcements, and changes in outlook. Read AVGO Dip Buyer Analyses to learn how the stock has rebounded from significant declines in history. Remember, investing in a single stock without comprehensive analysis can be risky. Consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.
