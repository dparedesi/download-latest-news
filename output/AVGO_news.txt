Title: Oracle's Post-Earnings Plunge Is Dragging These Tech Stocks Down With It

Oracle's (ORCL) stock tumbled Thursday, dragging other tech stocks down along with it, a day after the cloud computing giant posted sales that missed analysts' estimates. Oracle said new agreements with AI heavyweights Meta Platforms (META) and Nvidia (NVDA) helped grow its backlog to a record $523 billion, though that failed to sway investors from selling off Thursday amid persistent worries about circular AI deals and the company's reliance on a few large customers. Shares of Oracle were down nearly 14% in recent trading. AI hardware makers Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Micron Technology (MU), and Broadcom (AVGO)—which is set to report earnings after the closing bell today—also lost ground. Oracle shares rallied to a record high following its earnings report in September, but the stock has given up those gains in the months since amid growing worries about an AI bubble. Oracle's stock plunge Thursday despite a record backlog and pressure on other AI-exposed stocks could be taken as a signal of weakening confidence in the AI trade. Still, most Wall Street analysts say they're standing by Oracle's stock. Though ratings are still in flux, a majority of the 12 analysts with current ratings compiled by Visible Alpha consider the stock a "buy" with just three neutral ratings and one analyst advising selling the stock. William Blair analysts wrote following the report that while they expect Oracle's stock could be limited in the near term by debt concerns and spending plans, they believe its buildout "will pave the way for significant earnings growth in the years to come."

Title: Biggest Themes For Broadcom Heading Into Earnings

Live Blog Update #5 Published ← Back to Full Coverage: Live: Broadcom (AVGO) Q4 Earnings Coverage Coming off EPS beats versus consensus estimates and just about at all time highs, Broadcom is trading lower today, down 1.72% before earnings drop in just a few hours. As a refresher, here are the biggest themes from last quarter’s conference call: 1. Broadcom’s AI Engine Accelerates — XPUs Now the Center of Gravity Broadcom said AI semiconductors remain the company’s defining growth driver, with Q3 AI revenue climbing 63% YoY to $5.2B. The biggest shift: custom XPUs now make up 65% of AI revenue, as Broadcom gains share across all three legacy hyperscale customers. Management also confirmed a major new catalyst, a fourth XPU customer that has already placed more than $10B in AI rack orders, shipping in Q3 FY26. CEO Hock Tan signaled that FY26 AI growth will be even faster than FY25’s 50–60% pace, calling the outlook “fairly material.” 2. Networking Becomes the Next Bottleneck — Ethernet Takes the Lead As AI clusters scale toward 100,000+ compute nodes, Broadcom said networking is emerging as the key constraint and competitive battleground. Tan highlighted new product launches,Tomahawk 5, Tomahawk 6, and Jericho4, designed for scale-up, scale-out, and scale-across architectures, including multi–data center clusters. Broadcom framed Ethernet as the long-term winner over proprietary interconnects like NVLink, InfiniBand, or emerging UALink, citing its maturity, openness, and leadership position inside hyperscaler designs. XPUs are being built natively around Ethernet interfaces, reinforcing Broadcom’s advantage. 3. VMware Transformation Enters Phase Two — Private Cloud at Scale Broadcom reported 17% YoY growth in infrastructure software, driven by strong uptake of VMware Cloud Foundation. More than 90% of the top 10,000 VMware customers have now adopted VCF, marking the end of the licensing transition phase. The next stage is a multi-year deployment cycle as enterprises build out private cloud environments capable of running both traditional workloads and emerging AI jobs. Tan noted that Broadcom is intentionally commoditizing servers, storage, and networking to lower total cost of ownership for customers — a strategic lever to compete with public cloud. Traction in the mid-market remains mixed, but large-enterprise adoption continues to expand. With Broadcom’s conference call over, we’ll be ending our updates. Here are three takeaways from their earnings if you’re just joining us: Once again, you can read our updates below if you want more details on Broadcom’s earnings. And before you leave, make sure to check out our AI Investor Podcast. On the AI Investor Podcast, we don’t just discuss the biggest news in the space, we also give actionable recommendations. So far, our average recommendation is up 74%! In our next episode we’ll be diving deeper into Broadcom’s earnings, so subscribe to make sure you get a notification as soon as it’s released! As we noted in our prior update, Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) shares fell during the company’s conference call. Let’s unpack some of the highlights from the call and look at the reasons why shares collapsed during it. All conference call transcriptions are compliments of S&P Capital IQ. 1.) Broadcom Announces An Additional $11 Billion Order from Anthropic : “These XPUs, I may add, are not only been used to train and influence internal workloads by our customers, the same XPUs in some situations have been extended externally to other LLM peers, best exemplified at Google, where the TPUs use in creating Gemini, have also been used for AI cloud computing by Apple, Coherent and SSI as an example. And the scale at which we see this happening could be significant. And as you are aware, last quarter, Q3 ’25, we received a $10 billion order to sell the latest TPU Ironwood racks to Anthropic. And this was our fourth customer that we mentioned. And in this quarter Q4, we received an additional $11 billion order from the same customer for delivery in late 2026.” The big ‘announcement’ from the call was Hock Tan noting the company now has $21 billion in TPU orders from Anthropic, a massive sum equal to about 25% of Wall Street’s revenue estimates for calendar 2026. This large order is likely the reason Broadcom was able to guide AI Semiconductor revenue above consensus to doubling in Fiscal 2026. 2.) Broadcom has an AI Backlog of $73 Billion It Expects to Deliver Across the Next 18 Months “Well, to answer your first question, what we said is correct that as of now, we have $73 billion of backlog in place secured of XPUs, switches, DSPs, lasers for AI data centers that we anticipate shipping over the next 18 months. And obviously, this is as of now, I mean, we fully expect more bookings to come in over that period of time. And so don’t take that $73 billion as that’s the revenue that we ship over the next 18 months. We’re just saying we have that now and in that bookings has been accelerating. “ Broadcom’s CEO also noted that this bookings number is a current snapshot, and actual deliveries could top $73 billion in AI sales across the next 18 months as Broadcom takes additional orders. Overall, there was no specific negative news to point to for Broadcom’s drop. That is to say, often when a stock drops sharply during its conference call it’s because the company announced disappointing guidance or new material information that will be a negative. There wasn’t anything in Broadcom’s call that was a red flag. However, here are a few reasons that contributed to Broadcom’s drop. Broadcom shares have taken off in several recent conference calls, but today the opposite happened. Shares are down 4%, a reversal from the 3% gains when the call started, we’ll post our notes from the call shortly. We’ll slow updates as we listen to Broadcom’s conference call. Here are a few important notes: As of 4:45 p.m. ET, Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) shares are holding onto 3% gains after-hours. Next up, the company’s conference call begins at 5 p.m. We expect Wall Street to focus on the following key areas: As a reminder, here were the key themes from the company’s last conference call. 1. Broadcom’s AI Engine Accelerates — XPUs Now the Center of Gravity Broadcom said AI semiconductors remain the company’s defining growth driver, with Q3 AI revenue climbing 63% YoY to $5.2B. The biggest shift: custom XPUs now make up 65% of AI revenue, as Broadcom gains share across all three legacy hyperscale customers. Management also confirmed a major new catalyst, a fourth XPU customer that has already placed more than $10B in AI rack orders, shipping in Q3 FY26. CEO Hock Tan signaled that FY26 AI growth will be even faster than FY25’s 50–60% pace, calling the outlook “fairly material.” 2. Networking Becomes the Next Bottleneck — Ethernet Takes the Lead As AI clusters scale toward 100,000+ compute nodes, Broadcom said networking is emerging as the key constraint and competitive battleground.

The next stage is a multi-year deployment cycle as enterprises build out private cloud environments capable of running both traditional workloads and emerging AI jobs. Tan noted that Broadcom is intentionally commoditizing servers, storage, and networking to lower total cost of ownership for customers — a strategic lever to compete with public cloud. Traction in the mid-market remains mixed, but large-enterprise adoption continues to expand. Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) shares are up 3.2% after-hours. Here are some key reasons shares are surging. Why is guidance so strong? The likely answer is Google scaling its TPU project above Wall Street’s expectations. Beyond Broadcom, that’s great news for companies like Lumentum, Celestica, and TTMI Technologies. All three of those companies are also up after-hours. Broadcom (AVGO) will host its earnings call on Thursday, December 11 at 2:00 pm PT. You can join live by visiting the investor relations page here. As we’ve noted, Broadcom shares have seen massive moves during several recent conference calls. So we recommend getting the full details on what the company shares in tonight’s call. We will post an update after the call concludes so if you stay on this page, you will receive our analysis on the call. Broadcom delivered robust growth in Q4 2025, with revenue up 28.2% to $18.02 billion and net income nearly doubling to $8.52 billion. Cash and equivalents surged 73.1% to $16.18 billion, while operating cash flow climbed 37.5% to $7.70 billion. Broadcom announced it was raising its dividend to $.65 per share. That puts the company at a $2.60 target in Fiscal 2026. That’s not a massive yield, but the company does stay committed to returning capital to shareholders. The biggest reason Broadcom’s yield is low is because shares keep rising at such impressive rates. Shareholders can live with that situation. Let’s focus on the quotes from Broadcom CEO Hock Tan in their earnings release: “In Q4, record revenue of $18.0 billion grew 28% year-over-year, driven primarily by AI semiconductor revenue increasing 74% year-over-year. We see the momentum continuing in Q1 and expect AI semiconductor revenue to double year-over-year to $8.2 billion, driven by custom AI accelerators and Ethernet AI switches. We forecast Q1’26 total revenue of $19.1 billion and adjusted EBITDA of 67%.” Note that in Q4 AI semiconductor revenue was up 74% year-over-year but the forecast for Q1 is for it to double year-over-year. That is to say, Broadcom’s guidance implies acceleration beyond what Wall Street was modeling. Simply put, that is why shares are positive after-hours. As of 4:25, Broadcom shares are up 2.5%. Here’s a breakdown of the key figures from Broadcom’s (Nasdaq: AVGO) Q4 earnings. First quarter guidance of $19.1 billion, which tops expectations of $18.31 billion. That’s a solid beat on forward guidance. Here’s what the company had to say about AI revenue in the first quarter: “We see the momentum continuing in Q1 and expect AI semiconductor revenue to double year-over-year to $8.2 billion, driven by custom AI accelerators and Ethernet AI switches.” Shares are currently up 2.8%. Broadcom’s semiconductor sales were $11.07 billion which clears estimates of $10.73 billion. Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) earnings just hit the newswires and we’re reviewing them and will continue issuing new updates and analysis. However, here are the key numbers to focus on. What Broadcom Announced: Wall Street expected: Shares are initially up 3%. This is a developing story and we will continue updating this blog. Stay on it for more updates which will automatically load. Five more minutes until Broadcom reports. It’s a quiet earnings night with Lululemon, Costco, and Restoration Hardware being the other notable names reporting after the bell. The stock market just closed and Broadcom finished the day down 1.6%. Here are three notes before the company reports. 1.) As a reminder, we expect Broadcom’s earnings will drop at 4:15 p.m. ET. If you see a share price reaction before then, its likely just ‘noise.’ 2.) If you want to receive news and updates the moment Oracle’s earnings release, simply stay on this page. New updates should push automatically. 3.) If you haven’t had a chance yet, subscribe to our AI Investor Podcast. It’s free and offers new AI stock recommendations (the average recommendation in the portfolio is up 74% so far!) We’ll be breaking down Broadcom’s earnings in more detail in our next episode. As we noted earlier, the biggest story in the market today was Oracle (Nasdaq: ORCL) shares continuing to plummet. The company has been selling off across the past quarter on fears it was becoming too reliant on OpenAI. After Oracle announced capital expenditures would reach $50 billion in 2026 (a $15 billion rise from their last guidance), investors hit the exits. Fear peaked today at about 10 a.m. ET. At that time, the iShares Semiconductor ETF was down about 3%. As the day has gone on, stocks in the sector have rebounded. Yet, the iShares Semiconductor ETF is still down .83% in late trading while the Dow Jones is up 1.35%. Shares of Broadcom rebounded alongside most other semiconductor stocks, but are still down about 1.5% in late trading. NVIDIA saw a similar drop in the morning, and its shares are down 1.6% today. As a reminder, we expect Broadcom’s earnings to release at about 4:15 p.m. ET. The moment they hit the newswires we’ll begin posting live news and analysis. You don’t need to do anything for new updates to appear. Simply leave this page open and we’ll post the most important figures, analysis of Broadcom’s earnings, and a look at why the stock is either rising or falling after earnings. It’s almost time for Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) to report its Fiscal Q4 earnings. Here are five things you need to know to you prepared for tonight’s fourth quarter earnings release. Broadcom reports after the bell today, but if the stock is moving at 4:03 p.m. ET, it’s likely nothing related to earnings. We expect Broadcom’s earnings to hit newswires at 4:15 p.m. ET. Once earnings release, our team of technology analysts will begin breaking down Broadcom’s earnings and providing our analysis on why Wall Street is either buying up shares or selling Broadcom after its earnings release. Here’s what Wall Street expects when Broadcom reports tonight: What’s interesting is that while Broadcom’s share price has been rising steadily, up 61% the past six months, near-term expectations haven’t risen much. 90 days ago the street expected $1.87 in adjusted earnings and headed into today, that number is still just $1.87. If near-term expectations aren’t rising, you’re probably wondering why Broadcom’s stock has seen such incredible gains recently. The short answer is that expectations for out years (2027, 2028, 2029) have been rising steadily. For example, EPS expectations for next year were $9.17 ninety days ago and are now $9.39. By 2029, Wall Street expects Broadcom to generate $22.17 in adjusted profits as custom ASIC projects from new customers enter mass production. Prediction market Polymarket currently has 96% odds that Broadcom will beat earnings last quarter. If Broadcom missed earnings, we’d expect a fairly sharp negative reaction to its share price. Even if Broadcom tops estimates, that’s no assurance shares will rise. Finally, expect the reaction to Broadcom’s earnings to focus less on their performance last quarter and more on their guidance and what CEO Hock Tan says on the company’s conference call. Wall Street expects Broadcom to guide to $18.31 billion in sales in Fiscal Q1, so the company will likely need to top that number or else the initial reaction to their earnings release will be negative. It’s worth noting that in multiple recent quarters, shares of Broadcom have taken off after quotes from Hock Tan. Tan is a very savvy CEO, and will often save information for Broadcom’s call that he knows will be received warmly by the market. The company’s conference call starts at 5 p.m. ET. 24/7 Wall St. is focused on helping investors win big in the AI space. Every earnings season, we publish hundreds of live blogs like you’re reading right now, but our top resource is The AI Investor Podcast.

If you’re looking for a trusted source for discovering new AI stock ideas – and getting updates on stocks like Broadcom – look no further than the AI Investor Podcast. Broadcom enters Thursday’s post-market earnings report trading at $412.97, near its 52-week high of $414.61 and aligned with Wall Street’s consensus target of $412.02. The stock sits 15% above its 50-day moving average ($358.44) and 49% above its 200-day ($277.13), signaling strong bullish momentum. Key support levels formed at $390-$395 and $380-$385, tested and held during early December. Volume spiked to 47.3 million shares on November 24’s +8.7% breakout, with recent sessions maintaining elevated activity at 31.5 million shares—suggesting institutional positioning ahead of results. The technical setup reflects extreme optimism: 93.6% of analysts rate AVGO as Buy or Strong Buy, while Polymarket traders assign 68% odds the stock rises post-earnings. With four consecutive earnings beats averaging +2.64% above estimates, investors bet AI infrastructure demand drives another upside surprise when management reports at 4:00pm ET. Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) reports earnings after the bell tonight, but shares are already on the move this morning. As of 10:15 a.m. ET, shares are down a little more than 3%. Let’s look at why investors are selling off Broadcom shares before it reports earnings today. The biggest story in technology today is a sell-off in AI stocks caused by Oracle‘s (Nasdaq: ORCL) Fiscal Q2 earnings last night. We were covering the earnings live yesterday. At first, Oracle shares slumped 6% as investors weren’t pleased with the company missing on earnings last quarter. However, the selling really kicked into overdrive when Oracle announced its capital expenditure plans were rising by $15 billion this year. There has been a divide in technology where stocks that have exposure to Google and its TPU chips have seen strong gains in recent months while stocks with more exposure to OpenAI have sold off. Broadcom has benefitted from this dynamic, as Google is its number one customer. However, Broadcom’s future growth (and diversification away from Google) relies heavily on OpenAI, so concerns about Oracle taking on too much risk will impact Broadcom as well. We’re seeing a rotation out of riskier sector towards more conservative ones during today’s trading. Materials stocks are up 1.69%, Financials are up 1%, Health Care stocksa re up .98%. Meanwhile, Information Technology stocks are down 1.35%. This rotation out of highly appreciated stocks is hitting Broadcom. A final reason for Broadcom’s drop today is just likely some profit-taking before earnings. The company is up 73% year-to-date. Put another way, Broadcom has outperformed every Magnificent 7 stock, and is now larger than Mag 7 constituents like Meta Platforms and Tesla. With year-end approaching and fears that AI has reached a ‘bubble’ stage growing on Wall Street, we’re likely seeing some profit-taking before the company releases earnings tonight. Prediction markets signal overwhelming confidence in Broadcom beating the $1.87 non-GAAP EPS consensus when results drop after market close. Polymarket data shows 96% probability of a beat, with traders pushing odds higher throughout the day, up 8.1% in the last 24 hours alone. The market’s $21,200 total volume, with 75% traded in the past day, reflects conviction rather than speculation. That confidence isn’t baseless. Broadcom has beaten estimates for eight consecutive quarters, averaging a 2.7% surprise. Apply that pattern and the actual print lands near $1.92, right where the crowd expects. The tight bid-ask spread ($0.951/$0.964) shows minimal disagreement among participants. With the stock already up 21% over the past month to $413, traders have priced in success. The real test: whether management’s guidance justifies the rally or triggers profit-taking despite a beat.

Title: Bill Gates Has a Warning for AI Investors

One of America’s legendary tech founders has a warning for AI investors: They can't all be winners. “Not all of these valuations will end up going up. Some of them will go down," Bill Gates, co-founder of tech giant Microsoft (MSFT), said of AI stocks in an interview with CNBC on Wednesday. "It’s going to be hyper-competitive. A reasonable percentage of those companies won’t be worth that much.” Microsoft is among the tech giants whose massive investments in artificial intelligence have fueled the AI bubble debate raging on Wall Street. The so-called hyperscalers—Microsoft, Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META), and Oracle (ORCL)—are expected to spend $400 billion on infrastructure—much of it dedicated to training and running AI models—this year, and more than $500 billion next year. The AI boom has been the driving force behind the stock market rally for much of the past three years. But the rally has faltered in recent months due to lofty valuations and concerns that tech giants are overspending on AI. Some experts are reminding investors to pick and choose. Some investors worry the sheer size of those figures has encouraged speculation on Wall Street, causing some AI stocks to trade at eye-watering valuations. Software firm Palantir (PLTR) has a price-to-earnings ratio of more than 400, one of the highest in the S&P 500. Shares of chip designers Broadcom (AVGO) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) have soared this year on hopes they can take market share from AI chip leader Nvidia (NVDA); those gains have nudged their PE ratios above 100, more than three times that of the S&P 500 as a whole. Then there's the cohort of unprofitable startups commanding lofty valuations in private markets. OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, isn't expected to turn a profit before the end of the decade. Yet the start up was valued at $500 billion in October, which would make it the 16th largest public company in America. The AI buildout has turbocharged the sales and profits of some companies, leaving their valuations relatively steady despite big stock gains. AI demand has accelerated growth in the cloud computing businesses of Alphabet, Microsoft, and Amazon, all three of which have PE ratios hovering around 30. Booming demand for Nvidia’s chips made it a $4.5 trillion company, but shares trade at a relatively modest 45 times earnings. Bubble jitters have hit tech stocks several times since ChatGPT sparked the AI craze on Wall Street. In November, the Magnificent Seven nearly entered a technical correction. Less established competitors like Oracle (ORCL) and CoreWeave (CRWV) have performed even worse. As with past pullbacks, investors shook off valuation concerns and bought the dip, lifting tech stocks out of their slump. As of Wednesday, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was just 1% off its record high from late October. Stock valuations aside, Gate said he's confident in AI's potential to transform society and power advancements in health, education, and agriculture. AI, he said, "is a technology that's deeply profound, that will reshape the world. There’s not the slightest doubt about that."

Title: Broadcom Shares Down 3% Thursday After Oracle's Earnings Disappoint

Live Blog Update #3 Published ← Back to Full Coverage: Live: Broadcom (AVGO) Q4 Earnings Coverage Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) reports earnings after the bell tonight, but shares are already on the move this morning. As of 10:15 a.m. ET, shares are down a little more than 3%. Let’s look at why investors are selling off Broadcom shares before it reports earnings today. The biggest story in technology today is a sell-off in AI stocks caused by Oracle‘s (Nasdaq: ORCL) Fiscal Q2 earnings last night. We were covering the earnings live yesterday. At first, Oracle shares slumped 6% as investors weren’t pleased with the company missing on earnings last quarter. However, the selling really kicked into overdrive when Oracle announced its capital expenditure plans were rising by $15 billion this year. There has been a divide in technology where stocks that have exposure to Google and its TPU chips have seen strong gains in recent months while stocks with more exposure to OpenAI have sold off. Broadcom has benefitted from this dynamic, as Google is its number one customer. However, Broadcom’s future growth (and diversification away from Google) relies heavily on OpenAI, so concerns about Oracle taking on too much risk will impact Broadcom as well. We’re seeing a rotation out of riskier sector towards more conservative ones during today’s trading. Materials stocks are up 1.69%, Financials are up 1%, Health Care stocksa re up .98%. Meanwhile, Information Technology stocks are down 1.35%. This rotation out of highly appreciated stocks is hitting Broadcom. A final reason for Broadcom’s drop today is just likely some profit-taking before earnings. The company is up 73% year-to-date. Put another way, Broadcom has outperformed every Magnificent 7 stock, and is now larger than Mag 7 constituents like Meta Platforms and Tesla. With year-end approaching and fears that AI has reached a ‘bubble’ stage growing on Wall Street, we’re likely seeing some profit-taking before the company releases earnings tonight. With Broadcom’s conference call over, we’ll be ending our updates. Here are three takeaways from their earnings if you’re just joining us: Once again, you can read our updates below if you want more details on Broadcom’s earnings. And before you leave, make sure to check out our AI Investor Podcast. On the AI Investor Podcast, we don’t just discuss the biggest news in the space, we also give actionable recommendations. So far, our average recommendation is up 74%! In our next episode we’ll be diving deeper into Broadcom’s earnings, so subscribe to make sure you get a notification as soon as it’s released! As we noted in our prior update, Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) shares fell during the company’s conference call. Let’s unpack some of the highlights from the call and look at the reasons why shares collapsed during it. All conference call transcriptions are compliments of S&P Capital IQ. 1.) Broadcom Announces An Additional $11 Billion Order from Anthropic : “These XPUs, I may add, are not only been used to train and influence internal workloads by our customers, the same XPUs in some situations have been extended externally to other LLM peers, best exemplified at Google, where the TPUs use in creating Gemini, have also been used for AI cloud computing by Apple, Coherent and SSI as an example. And the scale at which we see this happening could be significant. And as you are aware, last quarter, Q3 ’25, we received a $10 billion order to sell the latest TPU Ironwood racks to Anthropic. And this was our fourth customer that we mentioned. And in this quarter Q4, we received an additional $11 billion order from the same customer for delivery in late 2026.” The big ‘announcement’ from the call was Hock Tan noting the company now has $21 billion in TPU orders from Anthropic, a massive sum equal to about 25% of Wall Street’s revenue estimates for calendar 2026. This large order is likely the reason Broadcom was able to guide AI Semiconductor revenue above consensus to doubling in Fiscal 2026. 2.) Broadcom has an AI Backlog of $73 Billion It Expects to Deliver Across the Next 18 Months “Well, to answer your first question, what we said is correct that as of now, we have $73 billion of backlog in place secured of XPUs, switches, DSPs, lasers for AI data centers that we anticipate shipping over the next 18 months. And obviously, this is as of now, I mean, we fully expect more bookings to come in over that period of time. And so don’t take that $73 billion as that’s the revenue that we ship over the next 18 months. We’re just saying we have that now and in that bookings has been accelerating. “ Broadcom’s CEO also noted that this bookings number is a current snapshot, and actual deliveries could top $73 billion in AI sales across the next 18 months as Broadcom takes additional orders. Overall, there was no specific negative news to point to for Broadcom’s drop. That is to say, often when a stock drops sharply during its conference call it’s because the company announced disappointing guidance or new material information that will be a negative. There wasn’t anything in Broadcom’s call that was a red flag. However, here are a few reasons that contributed to Broadcom’s drop. Broadcom shares have taken off in several recent conference calls, but today the opposite happened. Shares are down 4%, a reversal from the 3% gains when the call started, we’ll post our notes from the call shortly. We’ll slow updates as we listen to Broadcom’s conference call. Here are a few important notes: As of 4:45 p.m. ET, Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) shares are holding onto 3% gains after-hours. Next up, the company’s conference call begins at 5 p.m. We expect Wall Street to focus on the following key areas: As a reminder, here were the key themes from the company’s last conference call. 1. Broadcom’s AI Engine Accelerates — XPUs Now the Center of Gravity Broadcom said AI semiconductors remain the company’s defining growth driver, with Q3 AI revenue climbing 63% YoY to $5.2B. The biggest shift: custom XPUs now make up 65% of AI revenue, as Broadcom gains share across all three legacy hyperscale customers. Management also confirmed a major new catalyst, a fourth XPU customer that has already placed more than $10B in AI rack orders, shipping in Q3 FY26. CEO Hock Tan signaled that FY26 AI growth will be even faster than FY25’s 50–60% pace, calling the outlook “fairly material.” 2. Networking Becomes the Next Bottleneck — Ethernet Takes the Lead As AI clusters scale toward 100,000+ compute nodes, Broadcom said networking is emerging as the key constraint and competitive battleground. Tan highlighted new product launches,Tomahawk 5, Tomahawk 6, and Jericho4, designed for scale-up, scale-out, and scale-across architectures, including multi–data center clusters. Broadcom framed Ethernet as the long-term winner over proprietary interconnects like NVLink, InfiniBand, or emerging UALink, citing its maturity, openness, and leadership position inside hyperscaler designs. XPUs are being built natively around Ethernet interfaces, reinforcing Broadcom’s advantage. 3. VMware Transformation Enters Phase Two — Private Cloud at Scale Broadcom reported 17% YoY growth in infrastructure software, driven by strong uptake of VMware Cloud Foundation. More than 90% of the top 10,000 VMware customers have now adopted VCF, marking the end of the licensing transition phase. The next stage is a multi-year deployment cycle as enterprises build out private cloud environments capable of running both traditional workloads and emerging AI jobs. Tan noted that Broadcom is intentionally commoditizing servers, storage, and networking to lower total cost of ownership for customers — a strategic lever to compete with public cloud. Traction in the mid-market remains mixed, but large-enterprise adoption continues to expand. Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) shares are up 3.2% after-hours. Here are some key reasons shares are surging. Why is guidance so strong? The likely answer is Google scaling its TPU project above Wall Street’s expectations. Beyond Broadcom, that’s great news for companies like Lumentum, Celestica, and TTMI Technologies. All three of those companies are also up after-hours. Broadcom (AVGO) will host its earnings call on Thursday, December 11 at 2:00 pm PT. You can join live by visiting the investor relations page here. As we’ve noted, Broadcom shares have seen massive moves during several recent conference calls. So we recommend getting the full details on what the company shares in tonight’s call. We will post an update after the call concludes so if you stay on this page, you will receive our analysis on the call. Broadcom delivered robust growth in Q4 2025, with revenue up 28.2% to $18.02 billion and net income nearly doubling to $8.52 billion. Cash and equivalents surged 73.1% to $16.18 billion, while operating cash flow climbed 37.5% to $7.70 billion. Broadcom announced it was raising its dividend to $.65 per share. That puts the company at a $2.60 target in Fiscal 2026. That’s not a massive yield, but the company does stay committed to returning capital to shareholders. The biggest reason Broadcom’s yield is low is because shares keep rising at such impressive rates. Shareholders can live with that situation. Let’s focus on the quotes from Broadcom CEO Hock Tan in their earnings release: “In Q4, record revenue of $18.0 billion grew 28% year-over-year, driven primarily by AI semiconductor revenue increasing 74% year-over-year. We see the momentum continuing in Q1 and expect AI semiconductor revenue to double year-over-year to $8.2 billion, driven by custom AI accelerators and Ethernet AI switches. We forecast Q1’26 total revenue of $19.1 billion and adjusted EBITDA of 67%.” Note that in Q4 AI semiconductor revenue was up 74% year-over-year but the forecast for Q1 is for it to double year-over-year. That is to say, Broadcom’s guidance implies acceleration beyond what Wall Street was modeling. Simply put, that is why shares are positive after-hours. As of 4:25, Broadcom shares are up 2.5%. Here’s a breakdown of the key figures from Broadcom’s (Nasdaq: AVGO) Q4 earnings. First quarter guidance of $19.1 billion, which tops expectations of $18.31 billion. That’s a solid beat on forward guidance. Here’s what the company had to say about AI revenue in the first quarter: “We see the momentum continuing in Q1 and expect AI semiconductor revenue to double year-over-year to $8.2 billion, driven by custom AI accelerators and Ethernet AI switches.” Shares are currently up 2.8%. Broadcom’s semiconductor sales were $11.07 billion which clears estimates of $10.73 billion. Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) earnings just hit the newswires and we’re reviewing them and will continue issuing new updates and analysis. However, here are the key numbers to focus on. What Broadcom Announced: Wall Street expected: Shares are initially up 3%. This is a developing story and we will continue updating this blog. Stay on it for more updates which will automatically load. Five more minutes until Broadcom reports. It’s a quiet earnings night with Lululemon, Costco, and Restoration Hardware being the other notable names reporting after the bell. The stock market just closed and Broadcom finished the day down 1.6%. Here are three notes before the company reports. 1.) As a reminder, we expect Broadcom’s earnings will drop at 4:15 p.m. ET. If you see a share price reaction before then, its likely just ‘noise.’ 2.) If you want to receive news and updates the moment Oracle’s earnings release, simply stay on this page. New updates should push automatically. 3.) If you haven’t had a chance yet, subscribe to our AI Investor Podcast. It’s free and offers new AI stock recommendations (the average recommendation in the portfolio is up 74% so far!) We’ll be breaking down Broadcom’s earnings in more detail in our next episode. As we noted earlier, the biggest story in the market today was Oracle (Nasdaq: ORCL) shares continuing to plummet. The company has been selling off across the past quarter on fears it was becoming too reliant on OpenAI. After Oracle announced capital expenditures would reach $50 billion in 2026 (a $15 billion rise from their last guidance), investors hit the exits. Fear peaked today at about 10 a.m. ET. At that time, the iShares Semiconductor ETF was down about 3%. As the day has gone on, stocks in the sector have rebounded. Yet, the iShares Semiconductor ETF is still down .83% in late trading while the Dow Jones is up 1.35%. Shares of Broadcom rebounded alongside most other semiconductor stocks, but are still down about 1.5% in late trading. NVIDIA saw a similar drop in the morning, and its shares are down 1.6% today. As a reminder, we expect Broadcom’s earnings to release at about 4:15 p.m. ET. The moment they hit the newswires we’ll begin posting live news and analysis. You don’t need to do anything for new updates to appear. Simply leave this page open and we’ll post the most important figures, analysis of Broadcom’s earnings, and a look at why the stock is either rising or falling after earnings. It’s almost time for Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) to report its Fiscal Q4 earnings. Here are five things you need to know to you prepared for tonight’s fourth quarter earnings release. Broadcom reports after the bell today, but if the stock is moving at 4:03 p.m. ET, it’s likely nothing related to earnings. We expect Broadcom’s earnings to hit newswires at 4:15 p.m. ET. Once earnings release, our team of technology analysts will begin breaking down Broadcom’s earnings and providing our analysis on why Wall Street is either buying up shares or selling Broadcom after its earnings release. Here’s what Wall Street expects when Broadcom reports tonight: What’s interesting is that while Broadcom’s share price has been rising steadily, up 61% the past six months, near-term expectations haven’t risen much. 90 days ago the street expected $1.87 in adjusted earnings and headed into today, that number is still just $1.87. If near-term expectations aren’t rising, you’re probably wondering why Broadcom’s stock has seen such incredible gains recently. The short answer is that expectations for out years (2027, 2028, 2029) have been rising steadily. For example, EPS expectations for next year were $9.17 ninety days ago and are now $9.39. By 2029, Wall Street expects Broadcom to generate $22.17 in adjusted profits as custom ASIC projects from new customers enter mass production. Prediction market Polymarket currently has 96% odds that Broadcom will beat earnings last quarter. If Broadcom missed earnings, we’d expect a fairly sharp negative reaction to its share price. Even if Broadcom tops estimates, that’s no assurance shares will rise. Finally, expect the reaction to Broadcom’s earnings to focus less on their performance last quarter and more on their guidance and what CEO Hock Tan says on the company’s conference call. Wall Street expects Broadcom to guide to $18.31 billion in sales in Fiscal Q1, so the company will likely need to top that number or else the initial reaction to their earnings release will be negative. It’s worth noting that in multiple recent quarters, shares of Broadcom have taken off after quotes from Hock Tan. Tan is a very savvy CEO, and will often save information for Broadcom’s call that he knows will be received warmly by the market. The company’s conference call starts at 5 p.m. ET. 24/7 Wall St. is focused on helping investors win big in the AI space. Every earnings season, we publish hundreds of live blogs like you’re reading right now, but our top resource is The AI Investor Podcast.

Coming off EPS beats versus consensus estimates and just about at all time highs, Broadcom is trading lower today, down 1.72% before earnings drop in just a few hours. As a refresher, here are the biggest themes from last quarter’s conference call: 1. Broadcom’s AI Engine Accelerates — XPUs Now the Center of Gravity Broadcom said AI semiconductors remain the company’s defining growth driver, with Q3 AI revenue climbing 63% YoY to $5.2B. The biggest shift: custom XPUs now make up 65% of AI revenue, as Broadcom gains share across all three legacy hyperscale customers.

Tan noted that Broadcom is intentionally commoditizing servers, storage, and networking to lower total cost of ownership for customers — a strategic lever to compete with public cloud. Traction in the mid-market remains mixed, but large-enterprise adoption continues to expand. Broadcom enters Thursday’s post-market earnings report trading at $412.97, near its 52-week high of $414.61 and aligned with Wall Street’s consensus target of $412.02. The stock sits 15% above its 50-day moving average ($358.44) and 49% above its 200-day ($277.13), signaling strong bullish momentum. Key support levels formed at $390-$395 and $380-$385, tested and held during early December. Volume spiked to 47.3 million shares on November 24’s +8.7% breakout, with recent sessions maintaining elevated activity at 31.5 million shares—suggesting institutional positioning ahead of results. The technical setup reflects extreme optimism: 93.6% of analysts rate AVGO as Buy or Strong Buy, while Polymarket traders assign 68% odds the stock rises post-earnings. With four consecutive earnings beats averaging +2.64% above estimates, investors bet AI infrastructure demand drives another upside surprise when management reports at 4:00pm ET. Prediction markets signal overwhelming confidence in Broadcom beating the $1.87 non-GAAP EPS consensus when results drop after market close. Polymarket data shows 96% probability of a beat, with traders pushing odds higher throughout the day, up 8.1% in the last 24 hours alone. The market’s $21,200 total volume, with 75% traded in the past day, reflects conviction rather than speculation. That confidence isn’t baseless. Broadcom has beaten estimates for eight consecutive quarters, averaging a 2.7% surprise. Apply that pattern and the actual print lands near $1.92, right where the crowd expects. The tight bid-ask spread ($0.951/$0.964) shows minimal disagreement among participants. With the stock already up 21% over the past month to $413, traders have priced in success.

Title: Updates from Two Big Tech Firms Land This Week. What It Could Mean for the AI Trade

Time Published: 2025-12-09T20:33:11Z
Full Content:
Two tech giants shocked Wall Street with their earnings reports in September. Now they're under pressure to do it again. Software giant Oracle (ORCL) will report quarterly results after the market closes on Wednesday, followed by semiconductor firm Broadcom (AVGO) on Thursday afternoon. Their shares are up 33% and 75%, respectively, since the beginning of the year—but the stocks have diverged in recent months, reflecting the anxieties driving a shift in the AI investor debate. Wall Street is generally optimistic about both Oracle's and Broadcom's upcoming earnings reports. Analysts expect both companies, among the biggest in the S&P 500, to show signs that AI demand will remain strong into next year. But recent Goldman Sachs research suggests that sector stocks may not all be pulled higher by industry-level forces in the months ahead. In recent months, investors have grown increasingly wary of the AI investments that have fueled stock market gains for years. Oracle and Broadcom's earnings will offer investors evidence of AI demand from two perspectives, that of the AI chip supplier and that of the buyer. Oracle in early September supplanted Nvidia as the hottest AI play on Wall Street. The stock skyrocketed 36% the day after Oracle said its cloud computing backlog more than quadrupled to nearly $500 billion. Wall Street lauded the results, calling them evidence of a “truly historic” quarter that confirmed “a seismic shift happening in computing.” But then reports indicated that nearly all of Oracle’s backlog growth spawned from a $300 billion, multi-year deal with OpenAI, the ChatGPT-maker that is expected to burn through more than $100 billion before turning a profit at the end of the decade. That raised concerns that too many of Oracle’s eggs were in one big, risky basket. Meanwhile, the debate on Wall Street about whether cloud providers like Oracle are overspending on infrastructure intensified. Oracle sold $18 billion of bonds in September to help finance its data center investments, drawing attention to the fact that its debt burden is higher and its credit rating is lower than companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META). Oracle’s stock languished amid concerns about customer concentration and an AI bubble. Shares are down more than 30% in the past three months, a drop that’s erased all of the stock’s post-earning gains in September. Semiconductor and networking equipment provider Broadcom, meanwhile, is among the best-performing tech stocks in recent months, boosted by optimism that it is chipping away at Nvidia’s (NVDA) dominance in the AI chip market. Broadcom jumped nearly 10% after its September earnings report, when executives revealed they had secured a $10 billion order for custom chips from a new customer. As with Oracle, reports in the following days suggested the undisclosed customer was OpenAI. But unlike Oracle, Wall Street has only grown more bullish on Broadcom’s AI business—mostly because of the mid-November launch of Google’s Gemini 3, the tech giant’s first AI model to be trained exclusively with Broadcom-designed custom chips. Silicon Valley and Wall Street insiders alike raved about the model, prompting OpenAI to reportedly refocus on improving ChatGPT to fend off stiff competition. Google has reportedly discussed selling its custom chips to Meta, further boosting confidence that Broadcom can take market share from Nvidia. Broadcom shares have risen nearly 20% since Google launched Gemini, outperforming both the S&P 500, up 4%, and the Magnificent Seven, up 6%. Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent note analyzed the assumptions underpinning Wall Street's forecast for Oracle's business and stock. "The company is getting little if any credit for its business with OpenAI at the current share price of ~$200," they wrote. Analysts at Citi expect Oracle to report its backlog grew $100 billion last quarter, offering "more evidence that AI infrastructure demand is broad-based." Bank of America earlier this month raised its price target on Broadcom stock, citing an improved outlook for Google's custom chips. HSBC analyst Frank Lee forecast Broadcom's results Thursday would meet expectations before custom chip and networking demand accelerate the companies' AI business early next year. It may, however, no longer be the case that a rising AI tide lifts all boats. According to a Goldman Sachs report, the correlation between AI hyperscaler stocks was about 20% in mid-November, down from 80% in June. Update—December 9, 2025: This article was updated after markets closed on Tuesday with the latest stock performance data.

Title: Here's How Much Traders Expect Broadcom Stock to Move After Earnings

Full Content:
Broadcom (AVGO) is slated to release its fiscal fourth-quarter results after the market closes on Thursday, with traders expecting the chipmaker's stock could hit fresh record highs after the report. Based on current options pricing, Broadcom stock is expected to rise or fall by up to 6% by the end of the week. Based on Monday's closing price, that would lift Broadcom's stock to around $425 on the high end, further past the intraday record of $407 the stock set on Monday, or push it down to about $377. Last quarter, Broadcom's revenue hit a record $15.95 billion as the company topped estimates, prompting some analysts to call Broadcom a "Magnificent 8" stock that could continue to grow alongside Nvidia (NVDA) if the AI industry keeps expanding. Broadcom stock rallied following the report, setting multiple record highs in the months since. Broadcom designs AI chips used by several big tech companies—including Google, Meta and OpenAI—to train and run AI models such as ChatGPT and Gemini. Broadcom stock has been less affected than shares of other tech giants by the recent concerns over an AI bubble. Analysts from Bank of America and Morgan Stanley each recently raised their price targets for Broadcom stock, but noted that the chip designer faces long-term risks. The analysts said that Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google is looking to design its own future generations of AI chips in house, rather than the current generation that it has designed in partnership with Broadcom. That could put Broadcom's market share at risk if Google is successful and eventually looks to sell its designs to other current Broadcom customers. Broadcom's revenue is expected to jump 24% year-over-year to another record high of $17.48 billion, while adjusted earnings per share are projected to come in at $1.88, compared to $1.42 in the like period a year ago. Analysts are overwhelmingly bullish on Broadcom stock, with all 12 analysts with current ratings tracked by Visible Alpha rating the chipmaker as a "buy." The stock has an an average price target of $432.02, as analysts expect shares to continue rising to record levels.
