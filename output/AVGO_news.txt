(Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) This week, Nvidia finally poked its head briefly above the stock value of the dominant Apple empire, before settling back down to market value of $3.47 trillion with Apple’s value at $3.52 trillion. AP reporting shows how close this is, with a chart showing Nvidia’s rise against Apple and Microsoft, the other two dominant tech companies. “The Silicon Valley chipmaker is the dominant supplier of processors used in AI computing, and the company has become the biggest winner in a race between Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta Platforms and other heavyweights, to dominate the emerging technology,” write AP reporters Sruthi Shankar and Noel Randewich. “Known since the 1990s as a designer of processors for videogames, Nvidia's stock has risen about 18% so far in October, with a string of gains coming after OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, announced a funding round of $6.6 billion.” Microsoft now rests slightly below the other two, with around $3.18 trillion in value. Nvidia’s Past Stock Activity A look back shows that Nvidia also won out temporarily over the same competitors back in June of this year; prior to that, the firm’s stock price was under $100 per share, until it finally spiked early this year and continued to rise. Sticking at around $140 per share, this giant is now poised to earn its crown as the most valuable company in the world. The Difference Between Nvidia and Apple What this represents for the market is a major change from one kind of technology to another. You could express this three different ways: You could say that Apple makes consumer-facing technology, while Nvidia makes ‘back end’ server/hardware technology. You could say that Apple makes endpoint technology, where Nvidia makes supply technology. Or you could say that Apple makes devices that you can use, where Nvidia makes hardware that allows AI to think. With items likes A100 GPU, Nvidia is a dominant producer of AI hardware. And everybody wants a piece of this, from Microsoft and Blackrock, to all kinds of other stakeholders who are getting in on the AI revolution. The Threat of ASICs While Nvidia’s own chips are powerhouses in their own right, analysts show that many companies are investing in their own hardware in the form of custom chips known in the industry as application-specific integrated circuits or ASICs. Some of those closest to the phenomenon cite companies like Broadcom (AVGO) and others as competitor companies that may rise as their clients look for ASIC technology. However, Nvidia is also making its own play in the ASIC market, and will apparently open sores this technology. “There has been speculation that fixed function application-specific circuits (ASICs) might one day eclipse NVIDIA’s GPU-centric approach,” writes Karl Fruend at Moor Insights and Strategy. “Now NVIDIA itself seems to have embraced this approach, albeit in a limited fashion, announcing its own ASIC technology for Deep Learning acceleration. In a surprising and bold move, the company also announced that it will open source this technology to enable others to build chips using this technology.” Maybe that pivot will help them address one of the major threats to their dominance in the market. In any case, it’s a timely piece of news, because what it shows is that AI is ascendant. We’re watching this technology blossom right before our eyes, in real time, and after a few years of relative obscurity, Nvidia seems to have won out – at least for now. One Community. Many Voices.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 8 Best FAANG Stocks to Buy According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other FAANG stocks to buy according to analysts. Each of the big tech stocks has revealed its plans to invest $50 to $100 billion in GPU compute, evidence that Artificial intelligence may be the biggest theme right now. On October 21, Ray Wang, Constellation Research’s principal analyst, founder, and chairman, joined CNBC’s ‘Squawk Box’ to share his stance on the tech sector, especially the Magnificent Seven, and the role of artificial intelligence. The third quarter earnings season is upon us some of the mag seven are yet to report their quarterly results. Wang suggests artificial intelligence is just beginning to pan out and will stand as the major theme for a long while. He adds that companies, among the mega-caps, have poured hundreds of billions into AI during the first half of the year, and plan to add more during the second. He also shared that these mega-cap companies are driving demand as well. READ ALSO: Jim Cramer’s Game Plan: 23 Stocks to Watch and 10 AI Stocks to Watch for the Rest of 2024. While these expenditures may seem to have little to no payoff, historically investors were also worried about companies investing in the Internet. However, Wang dissects that the internet is not the same as artificial intelligence. The internet was rather open and decentralized and had many winners. AI, on the other hand, is more centralized, closed, and expensive, meaning that only a few players are going to make a mark. Wang also shares that he owns all of the magnificent seven stocks. An interesting conjunction, highlighted by Wang, is that across search, social media, and commerce, most of the stocks in the Mag 7 have digital ads. Across all these three avenues, the next players cannot compete with the Magnificent Seven, especially in terms of revenue. On the regulatory front, he emphasized that the sector needs some relief. He adds that the tech sector needs to play out mergers and currently IPOs are lined up, explaining why everything is on hold. FAANG is an acronym, which originally began as FANG, consisting of five major technology companies. The original term, FANG was coined by Jim Cramer in 2013 because, according to him, the four tech stocks belonged together as they functioned across similar themes of digitization and the web. FAANG today is much broader and includes technology companies that are shaping the future, which may also be categorized as the magnificent seven. That said, let’s take a look at the 8 best FAANG stocks to buy according to analysts. Our Methodology To come up with the 8 best FAANG stocks to buy according to analysts, we went over the NYSE FANG+ index and picked the latest holdings. We then examined the stocks and picked the ones with the highest analyst upside potential as of October 22, 2024. We also added the hedge fund sentiment of each stock as of Q2 2024. The list is in ascending order of analyst upside primarily and hedge fund holders, as of Q2 2024, secondarily. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit. Analyst Upside as of October 22, 2024: 10.9% Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 130 Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a semiconductor company that designs, develops, and supplies semiconductor and infrastructure software products. Some of its products include cable modems, networking processors, and storage adapters. 2024 has been quite a feat for Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO). During the year, the company launched two breakthrough technologies such as the industry’s first switch platform for scalable AI systems and Retimers, facilitating the management of large datasets for AI tasks. To keep its strategy active, on October 15, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) expanded its 20-year partnership with Deutsche Telekom’s subsidiary, T-Systems. The subsidiary is now a VMware Cloud Service Provider. On June 13, Nancy Tengler, CEO and chief investment officer of Laffer Tengler Investments, appeared in an Interview on Yahoo Finance where she shared her bullish stance on AVGO. Tengler states that AVGO is like the poor man’s NVIDIA and is part of her 12 best ideas portfolio. She adds that the company is in the sweet spot in the generative AI sector for both the hardware and software components. As Tengler states, AVGO indeed is in a sweet spot for AI. In the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024, Broadcom expects revenue from AI to grow by 10% sequentially reaching $3.5 billion, bringing the full-year total to $12 billion. In addition to that, its cloud computing platform for enterprises promises a solid growth opportunity as AVGO leverages artificial intelligence. ClearBridge Investments’ ClearBridge Large Cap Value Strategy stated the following regarding Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: "In IT, we bought Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) as we believe the company has a long runway for growth with its custom silicon business, which should be more durable and less volatile than other components within the AI food chain. We also believe the acquisition of VMware creates another opportunity for steady, subscription-based durable growth that is still in its early innings. We believe the stock has an attractive risk/reward profile given the reasonable visibility toward mid-teens EPS growth at a low-20s P/E multiple. We made room for Broadcom by exiting Lam Research, whose shares we believed priced in a full recovery, while we grew increasingly concerned that China exposure might create an air pocket." Overall AVGO ranks 4th among the 8 best FAANG stocks to buy according to analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.
