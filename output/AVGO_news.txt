(Photo Illustration by Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Broadcom’s (NASDAQ: AVGO) extraordinary 125% increase from $110 levels in early 2024 has investors pondering if the AI chipmaker can replicate its success. What might lead the stock to rise to $500+ levels from here in the coming years? The most persuasive factor is Broadcom’s custom silicon division. AI-related semiconductors now account for over 50% of Broadcom’s sales, marking a significant shift in the company’s revenue composition. The management of the company assesses the serviceable addressable market at $15-20 billion. The custom chip sector shows tremendous growth potential. The overall market for custom chips could expand to approximately $55 billion by 2028, effectively more than tripling from current figures. This growth reflects hyperscalers’ increasing preference for purpose-built silicon over generalized processors. Additionally, if you’re seeking a more consistent route to gains than investing in a single stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has surpassed the S&P and yielded over 91% since its inception. Also, check out – BigBear.ai: What's Happening With BBAI Stock? Other elements are at play as well. Broadcom's impressive earnings growth can support elevated valuations. The company's revenue is anticipated to grow at a high teens average annual rate to over $100 billion by 2029. Broadcom has high profitability with its adjusted net income margin of 50% in the past twelve months. This indicates that the impact on earnings will be more significant than on the top-line. At its present levels of $265, AVGO stock is trading at 45 times its trailing twelve months adjusted earnings of $5.84 per share. Additionally, check out – Broadcom’s Valuation Ratios. Maintaining this multiple could push the stock to around $500 within that timeframe. A higher multiple would enable an even greater increase. The existing customer relationships frequently involve multi-year commitments and substantial switching costs, which provides Broadcom with revenue visibility and pricing power, potentially maintaining premium valuations. For this multiple to broaden, Broadcom must showcase sustained strong annual revenue growth in AI segments, expand its market share in the custom silicon sector, focus on further margin improvement from a higher-value product mix, and secure contracts with new clients. In summary, Broadcom’s journey to doubling relies on capturing a significant portion of the growing custom chip market while preserving its technological prowess in AI networking. With the custom chip market potentially reaching $55 billion by 2028 and Broadcom’s current leading position, the company seems well-equipped for ongoing outperformance. While Broadcom displays strong growth prospects, several factors could restrict its upside. Consequently, investors considering Broadcom should carefully evaluate these risks. At Trefis, we incorporate such risks into our construction of the High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which encompasses 30 stocks and has consistently outperformed the S&P 500 over the last four years. What explains that outperformance? HQ Portfolio constituents tend to provide higher returns with lower volatility than the benchmark, as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO), and other semiconductor companies surged Tuesday, amid broader market gains as investors welcomed news of a cease-fire agreement between Israel and Iran. AMD stock was up 5% in recent trading, making it one of the best-performing stocks on the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, while Broadcom added 4%. Intel (INTC), Nvidia (NVDA), and TSMC (TSM) were also among the other chip stocks on the rise, boosting the PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX) over 3%. Micron Technology (MU) climbed 4% higher a day ahead of its quarterly results. On Monday, Melius analysts reportedly said AMD stock “has a lot more to go” as the company’s position in the artificial intelligence industry grows. The broker raised its price target to $175 from $110, above the Wall Street consensus of roughly $124 compiled by Visible Alpha. Broadcom stock meanwhile got an upgrade to “buy” from “hold” by analysts at HSBC Tuesday. The bank raised its price target to $400 from $240, placing it well above the Street consensus of $294. The chipmaker's application-specific integrated circuit business has the "potential to knock our socks off," HSBC said.
