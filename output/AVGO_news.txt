Title: DeepSeek's efficiency means Big Tech must stop hoarding, creating more winners. Here are the 12 stocks expected to benefit.

The good, bad, and the ugly are merging as AI enters the next stage of development: competition and efficiency. We all knew this day would come, but perhaps not as soon as it did. DeepSeek's more efficient and cheaper model means Big Tech suddenly has a chink in its armor. Investors question whether they have overvalued the blue chips and their pricing power, especially concerning their proprietary language models. It will be a volatile ride until Wall Street figures that out. For now, AI-related stocks have been dumping almost indiscriminately or at the slightest hint of a slowdown. Chip designer ARM was a recent victim of that trend. It announced earnings Wednesday with some of the best numbers you can get on a typical stock, said Sandeep Rao, a quantitative analyst at Leverage Shares ETPs. Still, the stock closed down by over 7%. "It's clearly evident that this stock is supposed to be soaring," Rao said. "The company's IP is used in virtually every major smartphone in the world. Its software is also used by Apple computers. It has a tie-up with Nvidia, and its backup is SoftBank, which is part of the Stargate project pumping $500 billion into AI cloud infrastructure." ARM CEO Rene Haas also welcomed DeepSeek during its February 5 earnings call, referring to it as "creative" and a welcomed efficiency that would only increase demand for computing. He added that his company was well-positioned to take advantage of efficiencies, including for smaller devices that don't require high-powered Nvidia chips. ARM isn't alone. As AI stocks report earnings, they find themselves in a similar predicament: explaining to Wall Street's money movers that they are well-positioned to continue riding out the AI hype. DeepSeek isn't exactly open source; in other words, it doesn't share its full code. It's open weight, which means it shows its memory or knowledge process. This allows users to adjust it for specific tasks, lowering the bar for startups and companies to enter the space and create specialized business models that could lead to affordability, increased demand, and explosive growth. Before DeepSeek, proprietary models required huge computing power, which meant expensive and small supercomputers were the perceived solution for efficiency. DeepSeek changed that thesis, suggesting that optimization isn't a hardware problem but one that can be addressed with code, Rao said. It also proved that the open-source community was far more efficient at driving results, validating the argument that AI and machine learning should not be done behind closed doors, Rao added. It's a technology that can best be done as a tide that lifts all boats instead of one that's hoarded by a few. But in terms of winners and losers, investors should be concerned with the picks and shovels: companies tasked with building AI infrastructure, said Abby Yoder, a US equity strategist at JPMorgan Private Bank. The focus must now turn to their revenue and gross margin line items to determine whether they will see the impact. She added that CapEx spending isn't dropping; it's actually increasing, but it could be shifting elsewhere. "So, are they going to be going to the incumbent winners that we've seen over the past couple of years who have had this outsized pricing power leading to those really high margins?" Yoder said. Or are they going to semiconductor companies making specialized chips, hardware providers, or software companies? It's the key query investors will need to be able to answer if they want to continue winning in this space. On JPMorgan's part, the investment bank's North America equity research team created a list of stocks they're overweight on and that they expect will be positively impacted by competitive and efficient AI. Software Companies that can use efficiency to increase their total addressable markets will be the new big winners. Here, Yoder believes it will be the software companies. Cloud-based data storage provider Snowflake (SNOW) is positioned to benefit from increased demand as more AI applications develop, increasing the requirement for data storage services. Cloud-based software provider Salesforce (CRM) could be at the forefront of benefiting from cheaper and therefore increased software use. Semiconductors In the semiconductor space, Yoder says an investor should focus on those gaining versus those losing market share. Overall, the demand for AI chips is expected to increase, not drop, though that may not be the case for every chipmaker, read JPMorgan's note. Within this sector, companies that provide application-specific integrated circuits" (ASICs), which are microchips made for certain functions instead of general use, are well-positioned to gain from the increased use of more accessible AI models. ASIC suppliers set to benefit include Broadcom (AVGO) and Marvell Technologies (MRVL). Micron (MU) is expected to benefit as a memory and storage chip provider as AI adoption accelerates. Despite fears about how necessary Nvidia's (NVDA) expensive and advanced chips will be, increased demand for AI models will also mean increased demand for GPUs. Internet and hyperscalers The big, leading names like Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta sit in this category. Not only are they developers of AI models, but they are also the spenders that largely determine where money for infrastructure and software will go. Here, efficiency will create a cheaper and broader ecosystem for AI on the internet, and the sharing of developments will push the big players to also become efficient, read JPMorgan's note, which projects 2025 capex spending for Amazon at $97 billion, Meta at $65 billion, and Google at $62 billion. Since Meta's Llama model is also open weight, it's expected to be a main beneficiary of language models like DeepSeek, where its efficiency can be integrated into Meta's ecosystem. "At 4Q earnings, META reiterated the benefits of open source LLMs, noted that costs can be driven down, & — in light of DeepSeek — emphasized the importance of having an American standard for open source that extends globally," JP Morgan's note read. Amazon is also not shying away from more efficacious models. Its cloud-computing platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), has already added DeepSeek to its AI platforms, making it available for use in some regions. While it could directly compete with more expensive options and impact pricing power, JPMorgan believes losses could be balanced with increased demand. Alphabet's place in this shift isn't as clear. JPMorgan believes that since the search giant is highly dependent on Gemini, its proprietary AI, there's less wiggle room here. However, Google can use lessons of efficiency to help it develop its own path to building out its models. Additionally, it has six new applications it is developing and 2 billion users it can distribute them to. Paul Marino, CRO of Themes ETFs, doesn't believe that large-scale institutions and hyperscalers will move to a true open-source model solely. So when several companies maintain commitments to Capex, it means they haven't even scratched the surface for required growth, this includes expansion into agentic AI, which are models that can make decisions and act on them. Hardware Once models are trained and built, the key part is their use in the inference process, where the model applies its abilities to provide results. As demand picks up, hardware companies involved in this process are set to benefit. These include Dell (DELL) Cisco (CSCO), and NetApp (NTAP). Jump to

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 11 Best Stocks To Invest In For Grandchildren. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other stocks. In an era where financial literacy is increasingly recognized as a crucial life skill, teaching children about stock market investing can provide them with a significant advantage. Studies show that early financial education leads to better money management, long-term wealth accumulation, and greater financial security in adulthood. By introducing children to investing at a young age, they can develop a mindset of patience, risk assessment, and the power of compounding—principles that can shape their financial future. A 2023 study by the National Financial Educators Council (NFEC) found that a lack of financial literacy costs the average American $1,819 per year. Teaching children about investing early can help reduce this financial gap and equip them with the necessary skills to navigate economic challenges. Introducing children to stocks helps them understand concepts like risk and reward, diversification, and market fluctuations. Learning how companies operate and grow their revenue also fosters a deeper understanding of the economy. This knowledge can prevent common financial mistakes such as emotional investing, excessive debt, and poor money management. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. One of the most compelling reasons to teach children about investing is the power of compound interest. If a child begins investing at age 10 instead of waiting until age 30, they could amass significantly more wealth by retirement, simply by starting early. Teaching children about stocks encourages critical thinking and discipline in financial decisions. Instead of seeing money as something to be spent impulsively, they learn the value of investing for the future. A study by Fidelity Investments found that 82% of parents who teach their children about finances believe it leads to greater financial independence. Additionally, teaching investment concepts through real-life experiences, such as monitoring a stock portfolio, fosters engagement and practical learning. With advancements in AI, automation, and digital finance, future generations will need financial acumen to navigate an evolving economy. Experts suggest that children who understand investing will be better prepared for retirement, homeownership, and entrepreneurship.
