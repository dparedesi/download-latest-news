October 13, 2025 – OpenAI and Broadcom have announced a landmark strategic collaboration to co-develop and deploy 10 gigawatts of OpenAI-designed AI accelerators and Broadcom Ethernet-based networking systems, setting the stage for the next generation of large-scale AI infrastructure. Under this multi-year partnership, OpenAI will design custom AI accelerators and systems, while Broadcom will manufacture and deploy the hardware across global data centers. The deployment is scheduled to begin in the second half of 2026 and is expected to be completed by the end of 2029. This partnership combines OpenAI’s frontier AI research and model expertise with Broadcom’s industry-leading semiconductor and networking technology, enabling the creation of scalable, power-efficient AI clusters. The systems will utilize Broadcom’s end-to-end Ethernet, PCIe, and optical connectivity solutions, providing the foundation for OpenAI’s next generation of large-scale AI workloads. “Partnering with Broadcom is a critical step in building the infrastructure needed to unlock AI’s potential and deliver real benefits for people and businesses,” said Sam Altman, co-founder and CEO of OpenAI. “Developing our own accelerators adds to the broader ecosystem of partners all building the capacity required to push the frontier of AI to provide benefits to all humanity.” “Broadcom’s collaboration with OpenAI signifies a pivotal moment in the pursuit of artificial general intelligence,” said Hock Tan, President and CEO of Broadcom. “We are thrilled to co-develop and deploy 10 gigawatts of next-generation accelerators and network systems to pave the way for the future of AI.” The initiative marks a significant shift in how OpenAI approaches infrastructure design. By creating its own chips, OpenAI gains direct control over the optimization of hardware for its models, integrating lessons learned from developing GPT models and other frontier systems. “Our collaboration with Broadcom will power breakthroughs in AI and bring the technology’s full potential closer to reality,” said Greg Brockman, co-founder and President of OpenAI. “By building our own chip, we can embed what we’ve learned from creating frontier models and products directly into the hardware, unlocking new levels of capability and intelligence.” Broadcom emphasized that the collaboration highlights the importance of Ethernet as the backbone of AI data center scalability, providing flexibility and efficiency across massive distributed clusters. “Our partnership with OpenAI continues to set new industry benchmarks for the design and deployment of open, scalable, and power-efficient AI clusters,” said Charlie Kawwas, Ph.D., President of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group. “Custom accelerators combine remarkably well with standards-based Ethernet scale-up and scale-out networking to provide cost and performance-optimized next-generation AI infrastructure.” The collaboration arrives as demand for AI compute infrastructure continues to surge worldwide. With over 800 million weekly active users across ChatGPT and other OpenAI products, and strong adoption from enterprises and developers, the new accelerator systems aim to future-proof OpenAI’s global infrastructure and advance its mission of ensuring artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity.

Title: Broadcom Stock Rises 90% In 6 Months - What’s Fueling The Rally?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. From a quantitative perspective, the 90.4% change in Broadcom (AVGO) stock from 4/12/2025 to 10/9/2025 was mainly driven by a 71.0% change in the company's Net Income Margin (%). There’s more to this story than simply numbers, so let's first break down the stock price movements into their contributing factors. That's one perspective on stocks. Trefis High Quality Portfolio assesses much more and is crafted to minimize stock-specific risk while offering upside potential. Returning to the “change”: The alteration in fundamental factors such as valuation, revenue, and margins has a background story concerning the business and investor sentiment. Below, we have pinpointed critical developments that affected stock price movement for AVGO stock. As a brief background: AVGO offers semiconductor devices and infrastructure software, which includes set-top box system-on-chips, cable, DSL, and passive optical networking solutions. Opinion: We currently find AVGO stock appealing yet volatile. Why is that? Take a look at the complete story. Read Buy or Sell AVGO Stock to understand what informs our current viewpoint. Risk: However, AVGO is not insulated from significant decreases. It declined nearly 48% during the Covid pandemic, approximately 35% in the 2021 inflation shock, and around 27% during the 2018 correction. Even with solid fundamentals, it's evident that the stock can experience significant drops when the market turns. Strong companies still endure difficulties when sentiment shifts dramatically. Consistently selecting winners is a challenging endeavor - particularly due to the volatility associated with individual stocks. Instead, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which comprises 30 stocks, has a history of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the past 4-year period. What accounts for this? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered better returns with reduced risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster experience, as demonstrated in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
