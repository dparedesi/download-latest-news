Title: Will Nvidia Break $300 in 2026 or Should You Buy Broadcom Stock Instead?

Investing Nvidia (NVDA) trades at less than 25 times forward earnings with 62% expected EPS growth next year. Broadcom (AVGO) carries $65B in debt and trades at 34 times forward earnings with slower growth. Nvidia has traded flat around $180 since August while underlying earnings continue climbing. Sending You to Google News in 3 © HelloRF Zcool / Shutterstock.com There has been a loss of momentum for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) in recent months, which has been the case for many other stocks leading the AI rally. Investors are using that as an excuse to move into other names in the stock market, but is that really a smart idea today? NVDA stock trades at $180 as of this writing. Shares have been lingering in the $180 range since August. One would expect a lot more action from the supposedly best AI bet. The anemic price action can mostly be traced back to the anxiety investors have about the “AI bubble” potentially bursting this year. Nvidia is an easy target for the bears after all. However, bulls expect the price action to speed up in the coming months through next year. Financials are still healthy, and Wall Street can’t keep underpaying if earnings keep climbing. Could this take NVDA stock above $300 this year, or should you buy Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) instead? AVGO stock has been hotter than Nvidia due to its smaller size and competitiveness in the AI scene. Let’s find out if it can keep that up this year or if you’re better off sticking to NVDA stock. The stock may be trading sideways, but it is actually getting cheaper… fast! The company’s underlying earnings have been climbing quarter after quarter, meaning a flat share price has turned Nvidia into one of the cheapest AI chip stocks you can buy today if you go by the forward price-to-earnings ratio. NVDA stock trades at less than 25 times earnings, despite analysts expecting 62% EPS growth for the next fiscal year. Revenue growth is also expected to be 50.6%. Growth hasn’t fallen off as quickly as the bears would have expected, and AI demand has remained strong with no sign of a slowdown. Management has kept its beat-and-raise cadence. As a result, nothing yet points to any weakness that can drag the stock down substantially from here. Instead, I expect the growth to continue and accelerate in the coming months. NVDA stock should ideally trade at around 35 to 40 times forward earnings. Even that might be too cheap, considering stocks like AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) go for 35 times forward earnings with half the sales growth. The biggest predictor of NVDA’s price is its earnings. If we look at EPS, FY 2026 (ending January 2026) is expected to end with Nvidia having $4.7 in EPS. Guidance suggests revenue of around $213.3 billion. 2027 EPS is expected at $7.6, with revenue of $321.2 billion. If NVDA stock trades at 35 times earnings for FY 2027, the stock price can hit $266. I expect it to go even higher if management keeps beating estimates and raises its guidance. The highest EPS estimate puts $9.7 as a possibility for FY 2027, meaning NVDA stock could trade over $300 at just 31 times earnings. It is likely that the premium paid would be even higher if it managed to outperform consensus by such a wide margin. Anyhow, $300 is clearly in the books for Nvidia this year. The stock needs to climb 60% from here to be at $300, which should happen as long as the share price follows EPS growth. I would go further and put $266 as the floor price for 2026. The PE ratio is unlikely to drop below 35 times earnings. I’d argue that AVGO stock gives you a worse deal compared to Nvidia. You’re paying more per dollar of the company’s earnings, even though it has worse growth metrics and a worse long-term outlook. The company does come with an “underdog” story due to custom AI chips plausibly stealing customers from Nvidia, but it’s not going to make a dent in its market share. You’re paying 34 times forward earnings and 17 times forward sales for the stock. Growth is expected to be over 50% for both sales and EPS, but fall to 38% in FY 2027. Keep in mind that the total debt load is over $65 billion, so the enterprise value is also slightly worse. With that in mind, I’d stick to NVDA stock. Our top personal finance-related articles today.

Title: 5 Things to Know Before the Stock Market Opens

Stock futures are sinking Tuesday morning amid rising geopolitical concerns; President Donald Trump has threatened new tariffs on a number of European countries unless the U.S. is allowed to acquire Greenland; gold and silver prices are surging to new record highs as investors turn to safe-haven assets; tech stocks are under pressure amid the volatiity; and Netflix's latest quarterly results are due after the closing bell as the company sweetens its offer for Warner Bros. Discovery. Here's what you need to know today. Stocks are tumbling after President Trump over the weekend threatened new tariffs on several European countries if the U.S. isn't allowed to acquire Greenland. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and tech-heavy Nasdaq were recently down 1.2%, 1.4%, and 1.7%, respectively. The major indexes posted modest losses last week amid concerns that Federal Reserve independence could be compromised. Gold futures were up 3% at $4,730 an ounce recently, a new all-time high, while silver futures surged nearly 8% to $95.30 an ounce, also a record, as investors turned to safe havens. The yield on the 10-year Treasury was at 4.29%, up from its previous close of 4.23% and at its highest level since early September. Bitcoin was just above $91,000, down from a weekend high of above $95,000 and on track to decline for a sixth straight day as its early-year rally stalls. Financial markets are volatile this morning after President Trump said that Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Finland will each face a 10% tariff at the start of February that will increase to 25% on June 1 if the U.S. is not allowed to purchase Greenland. The Trump administration in recent weeks has stepped up its interest in acquiring Greenland, saying it aims to do so with money or with military force. Early Tuesday, Trump posted fake images of himself, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Vice President J.D. Vance putting an American flag in the ground next to a sign calling Greenland U.S. territory, along with a photoshopped map showing Canada with an American flag on it. Gold is leading another safe-haven-asset rally, hitting a record of nearly $4,740 an ounce earlier this morning. Silver is also adding to its gains to start the year, setting its own record high just above $95 an ounce. Gold and other precious metals typically increase in value when investors are uncertain of the economy or the state of geopolitics and therefore less likely to invest in more-volatile assets such as stocks or cryptocurrency. The precious metals have already been gaining steadily this year amid concerns over the independence of the Federal Reserve. Gold futures have risen 70% over the past 12 months, while silver has surged about 200%. All seven of the Magnificent Seven stocks are losing ground this morning amid the larger market sell-off that is hitting tech stocks particularly hard. Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Tesla (TSLA), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta Platforms (META) are all down between 1% and 3% in premarket trading. Chipmaker stocks including Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Broadcom (AVGO) are also down sharply. Tech stocks have powered much of the market's growth in recent years amid the AI boom, making the stocks also vulnerable to being hit hard when there is a broad sell-off like the one happening today. Netflix (NFLX) stock has resisted the sell-off so far this morning, as investors await the streaming giant's latest quarterly earnings report after the closing bell and digest news that the company is now offering all cash to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD). Netflix executives will likely face questions from analysts during the earnings call about the pending acquisition, on topics including regulatory hurdles, competition from Paramount Skydance (PSKY), how the deal will be financed, and the timeline for when the deal could be completed. Netflix is expected to report that revenue rose 17% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, while earnings per share are projected 30% higher, according to estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. Netflix shares were up about 1% ahead of Monday's opening bell.
