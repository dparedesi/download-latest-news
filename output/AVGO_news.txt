Title: Why New China Chip Export Curbs Could Affect Far More Than Just Nvidia, AMD

Tech losses weighed on the major indexes Thursday, extending yesterday's sell-off amid worries tightening restrictions on exports to China could have wide-reaching impacts. The tech sector led losses on the S&P 500 as shares of Nvidia (NVDA) dropped over 3% in recent trading, making it one of the leading decliners on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The stock had tumbled close to 7% Wednesday after the chipmaker said it's set to take a $5.5 billion charge due to new export curbs on the sale of its H20 chips to China. Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), which also warned it would likely take a hit from new China export restrictions, slipped 1%. Broadcom (AVGO), Micron Technology (MU), and other semiconductor stocks were lower as well, along with shares of server maker and Nvidia partner Super Micro Computer (SMCI) and several other AI hardware makers. (Read Investopedia's live coverage of today's market action here.) "Rising AI restrictions are likely to impact other key AI-levered computing, networking and optical stocks (AVGO, AMD, MU, ARM, MRVL, COHR, LITE) and raise concerns around enhanced restrictions in other areas," Bank of America analysts said following the news from Nvidia. Like Morgan Stanley analysts, they added Nvidia's write-down indicates a "low probability of future licenses" to circumvent the new restrictions, and that AI diﬀusion rules set to take effect in May could further limit sales of American AI hardware to a broader set of countries. Wedbush analysts told clients in a note Thursday, "We expect hardly any tech companies to give guidance over the next month given this Twilight Zone backdrop. While the Nvidia news is concerning it's not a shock as we are in the middle of a trade war between the US and China and expect more punches thrown by both sides before cooler heads prevail and negotiations in some form can begin to play out over the coming weeks/months."

Title: Traders Expect a Big Netflix Stock Move After Earnings—Here’s How Much

Netflix (NFLX) is slated to report first-quarter results after markets close Thursday, and options markets suggest traders are expecting a big stock price move in the following days. Netflix options pricing on Wednesday signaled the stock is expected to move approximately 8.5% in either direction in the week after Thursday’s report, suggesting a stock-price range of between $893.47 and $1,059.09. (U.S. financial markets are closed on Friday, which means any big move in the stock won't happen until next week.) Uncertainty is high heading into Netflix’s report, and that uneasiness is reflected in options prices for nearly all stocks. “The market is pricing in the highest average implied moves since 1Q20,” wrote JPMorgan analysts in a note on Monday. By their calculations, the average implied earnings-day move for the stocks they cover is 8.1% this quarter, compared with a realized average of 6.5% last quarter and 5.9% over the last three years. In the same note, JPMorgan compared the historical post-earnings moves of the 60 largest S&P 500 stocks and their implied volatility this quarter. They found Netflix was among the stocks with the most underestimated—or "cheapest"—post-earnings volatility. Over the past three years, the stock’s post-earnings move has averaged about 11%, making it and Meta Platforms (META) the most volatile names in JPMorgan's sample. Netflix's "cheap" implied volatility puts it in the minority. Traders are pricing in smaller-than-average moves for only nine of the 60 largest stocks in the S&P 500, according to JPMorgan's analysis. Tech giants Nvidia (NVDA), Meta, Broadcom (AVGO) and Oracle (ORCL) are among those nine. Netflix stock has jumped following each of its last two earnings reports. Shares advanced nearly 10% the day after fourth-quarter earnings topped estimates in January. The company also raised its revenue forecast for 2025 and boosted its share buyback program by $15 billion. In October of last year, Netflix beat expectations for its top and bottom lines, and indicated strong demand for its ad-supported subscription tier, sending shares soaring more than 11% the next day. Netflix stock popped on Tuesday after a report that the streaming giant is aiming to double its revenue to about $78 billion by 2030, an ambitious goal that the company hopes will propel it into the $1 trillion market-capitalization club alongside tech giants like Alphabet (GOOG) and Amazon (AMZN). Analysts are generally bullish on Netflix stock heading into earnings. Oppenheimer on Monday stuck by its “buy” rating and $1,150 price target—among the highest on Wall Street—and expressed confidence the streamer will be mostly insulated from tariffs and an economic slowdown. Netflix shares fell 1.5% on Wednesday amid a broad sell-off. Even with the decline, the company's shares are up about 8% so far this year and have risen 56% over the past 12 months.

More Lucas via AFP) (Photo by RICCARDO MILANI/Hans Lucas/AFP via Getty Images) Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ: AVGO) stock has risen 12% over the past five days due to two key developments: a broader market rebound after President Trump suspended reciprocal tariffs for 90 days, and the company’s announcement of a $10 billion share buyback program. Despite the recent gains, AVGO is still down over 20% this year. Such fluctuations are not unusual for the stock—AVGO fell 36% during the 2022 inflation-driven downturn and dropped 48% during the COVID-19-related market selloff in 2020. However, for investors seeking a potentially more stable and high-performing alternative, consider the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, which includes 30 stocks with a strong record of consistently outperforming the S&P 500 over the past four years. Broadcom’s key financial indicators highlight its strong foundation: For long-term investors, the recent decline in AVGO stock could offer a compelling entry point, considering the company’s solid fundamentals and AI leadership. Those sensitive to volatility should consider hedging, consulting a financial advisor, or diversification, such as the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark to produce strong returns for investors. A calm, strategic approach is crucial for wealth generation during market volatility. Invest with Trefis Market Beating Portfolios | Rules-Based Wealth
