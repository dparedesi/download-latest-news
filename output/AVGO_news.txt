Title: Updates from Two Big Tech Firms Land This Week. What It Could Mean for the AI Trade

Time Published: 2025-12-09T20:33:11Z
Full Content:
Two tech giants shocked Wall Street with their earnings reports in September. Now they're under pressure to do it again. Software giant Oracle (ORCL) will report quarterly results after the market closes on Wednesday, followed by semiconductor firm Broadcom (AVGO) on Thursday afternoon. Their shares are up 33% and 75%, respectively, since the beginning of the year—but the stocks have diverged in recent months, reflecting the anxieties driving a shift in the AI investor debate. Wall Street is generally optimistic about both Oracle's and Broadcom's upcoming earnings reports. Analysts expect both companies, among the biggest in the S&P 500, to show signs that AI demand will remain strong into next year. But recent Goldman Sachs research suggests that sector stocks may not all be pulled higher by industry-level forces in the months ahead. In recent months, investors have grown increasingly wary of the AI investments that have fueled stock market gains for years. Oracle and Broadcom's earnings will offer investors evidence of AI demand from two perspectives, that of the AI chip supplier and that of the buyer. Oracle in early September supplanted Nvidia as the hottest AI play on Wall Street. The stock skyrocketed 36% the day after Oracle said its cloud computing backlog more than quadrupled to nearly $500 billion. Wall Street lauded the results, calling them evidence of a “truly historic” quarter that confirmed “a seismic shift happening in computing.” But then reports indicated that nearly all of Oracle’s backlog growth spawned from a $300 billion, multi-year deal with OpenAI, the ChatGPT-maker that is expected to burn through more than $100 billion before turning a profit at the end of the decade. That raised concerns that too many of Oracle’s eggs were in one big, risky basket. Meanwhile, the debate on Wall Street about whether cloud providers like Oracle are overspending on infrastructure intensified. Oracle sold $18 billion of bonds in September to help finance its data center investments, drawing attention to the fact that its debt burden is higher and its credit rating is lower than companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META). Oracle’s stock languished amid concerns about customer concentration and an AI bubble. Shares are down more than 30% in the past three months, a drop that’s erased all of the stock’s post-earning gains in September. Semiconductor and networking equipment provider Broadcom, meanwhile, is among the best-performing tech stocks in recent months, boosted by optimism that it is chipping away at Nvidia’s (NVDA) dominance in the AI chip market. Broadcom jumped nearly 10% after its September earnings report, when executives revealed they had secured a $10 billion order for custom chips from a new customer. As with Oracle, reports in the following days suggested the undisclosed customer was OpenAI. But unlike Oracle, Wall Street has only grown more bullish on Broadcom’s AI business—mostly because of the mid-November launch of Google’s Gemini 3, the tech giant’s first AI model to be trained exclusively with Broadcom-designed custom chips. Silicon Valley and Wall Street insiders alike raved about the model, prompting OpenAI to reportedly refocus on improving ChatGPT to fend off stiff competition. Google has reportedly discussed selling its custom chips to Meta, further boosting confidence that Broadcom can take market share from Nvidia. Broadcom shares have risen nearly 20% since Google launched Gemini, outperforming both the S&P 500, up 4%, and the Magnificent Seven, up 6%. Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent note analyzed the assumptions underpinning Wall Street's forecast for Oracle's business and stock. "The company is getting little if any credit for its business with OpenAI at the current share price of ~$200," they wrote. Analysts at Citi expect Oracle to report its backlog grew $100 billion last quarter, offering "more evidence that AI infrastructure demand is broad-based." Bank of America earlier this month raised its price target on Broadcom stock, citing an improved outlook for Google's custom chips. HSBC analyst Frank Lee forecast Broadcom's results Thursday would meet expectations before custom chip and networking demand accelerate the companies' AI business early next year. It may, however, no longer be the case that a rising AI tide lifts all boats. According to a Goldman Sachs report, the correlation between AI hyperscaler stocks was about 20% in mid-November, down from 80% in June. Update—December 9, 2025: This article was updated after markets closed on Tuesday with the latest stock performance data.

Title: Here's How Much Traders Expect Broadcom Stock to Move After Earnings

Full Content:
Broadcom (AVGO) is slated to release its fiscal fourth-quarter results after the market closes on Thursday, with traders expecting the chipmaker's stock could hit fresh record highs after the report. Based on current options pricing, Broadcom stock is expected to rise or fall by up to 6% by the end of the week. Based on Monday's closing price, that would lift Broadcom's stock to around $425 on the high end, further past the intraday record of $407 the stock set on Monday, or push it down to about $377. Last quarter, Broadcom's revenue hit a record $15.95 billion as the company topped estimates, prompting some analysts to call Broadcom a "Magnificent 8" stock that could continue to grow alongside Nvidia (NVDA) if the AI industry keeps expanding. Broadcom stock rallied following the report, setting multiple record highs in the months since. Broadcom designs AI chips used by several big tech companies—including Google, Meta and OpenAI—to train and run AI models such as ChatGPT and Gemini. Broadcom stock has been less affected than shares of other tech giants by the recent concerns over an AI bubble. Analysts from Bank of America and Morgan Stanley each recently raised their price targets for Broadcom stock, but noted that the chip designer faces long-term risks. The analysts said that Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google is looking to design its own future generations of AI chips in house, rather than the current generation that it has designed in partnership with Broadcom. That could put Broadcom's market share at risk if Google is successful and eventually looks to sell its designs to other current Broadcom customers. Broadcom's revenue is expected to jump 24% year-over-year to another record high of $17.48 billion, while adjusted earnings per share are projected to come in at $1.88, compared to $1.42 in the like period a year ago. Analysts are overwhelmingly bullish on Broadcom stock, with all 12 analysts with current ratings tracked by Visible Alpha rating the chipmaker as a "buy." The stock has an an average price target of $432.02, as analysts expect shares to continue rising to record levels.
