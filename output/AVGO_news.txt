Investing.com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week. InvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today! Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) reaffirmed Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) as a top stock pick for 2025, maintaining its Overweight rating and a price target of $166. Despite some near-term headwinds, including a slowdown in Hopper builds and staggered Blackwell product readiness, Morgan Stanley views these challenges as temporary. By the second half of 2025, the strength of Blackwell will be “the only topic,” the firm’s analysts stressed. Addressing competitive pressures from ASIC solutions, particularly from Marvell (NASDAQ:MRVL) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Morgan Stanley believes purchasing trends will favor GPUs over time. “While our forecasts for both AVGO/MRVL ASIC revenue are largely conservative, as are our forecasts for GPU, we believe that GPU will meaningfully outperform ASIC this year,” analysts noted. The report also highlights Nvidia’s $12 billion annual R&D investments as critical for maintaining its leadership in AI hardware and system-level innovations. Analysts also addressed the concerns over industry challenges, including scaling Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) clusters. While technologists advocate for larger AGI systems, financial backers remain cautious about return on investment (ROI). Nvidia’s innovations, such as Mellanox (NASDAQ:MLNX) and NV-Link, are positioned to improve efficiency in this area. Nvidia’s growth drivers—including inference, sovereign AI training, and enterprise applications—account for 70% of its data center revenue. Analysts believe these segments will continue driving growth even amid potential industry consolidation by 2026. “Even with some consolidation in the arms race, we should still see enduring growth potential,” they commented. The upcoming Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in January 2025 is expected to boost sentiment for Nvidia. Analysts anticipate the messaging will emphasize strong Blackwell demand, albeit with supply constraints. “But by mid year we remain comfortable that the focus will remain on Blackwell which will be the driving force behind revenue in 2h, potentially unlocking more significant upside,” the note concluded. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has experienced an extraordinary rally since the U.S. election, solidifying its status as the market's "narrative king," according to analysts at Barclays (LON:BARC). The electric vehicle (EV) maker's shares have surged approximately 90%, adding about $730 billion to its market capitalization - a feat matched only by a few tech giants like Nvidia and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Barclays notes that this performance is particularly remarkable given the stock's apparent disconnect from underlying fundamentals. Tesla's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has soared from 80x before the election to an elevated 145x based on 2025 consensus EPS estimates. “The decoupling from fundamentals in many ways mirrors the rally we saw from Tesla in 2020-21," analysts led by Dan Levy said in a note. They attribute this rally to the "magnification of Tesla's narrative command," which centers around themes like autonomous vehicles (AV) and AI. Another factor contributing to the surge is the "Tesla-financial complex," where options activity amplifies stock movements. Moreover, retail investor interest remains robust, with 30% of Tesla's outstanding shares held by individual investors, according to Barclays. “Tesla remains the 'OG meme stock,'” the analysts emphasized. Barclays also pointed out the growth of the "Elon premium" in Tesla's valuation. The increased prominence of CEO Elon Musk has elevated interest in the company, translating to heightened enthusiasm for Tesla's stock. Bank of America (BofA) downgraded Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) to Neutral from Buy, citing a weaker-than-anticipated gross margin (GM) outlook for the second and third fiscal quarters. Shares of the chipmaker fell sharply Thursday after delivering disappointing Q2 guidance. Micron projects second-quarter revenue of approximately $7.9 billion, missing both BofA's $8.3 billion estimate and the consensus forecast of $9 billion. The company also expects a Q2 GM of 38.5%, below BofA's 40% estimate and the consensus of 41%. “Data center and HBM trends remain strong but weakness in PC and phone markets are putting downward pressure on memory pricing, especially in NAND,” BofA analysts led by Vivek Arya noted. Persistent pricing challenges in NAND are expected to extend into the third quarter. Although BofA remains optimistic about Micron's position in high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and AI markets, it lowered its fiscal 2025 and 2026 pro forma earnings per share estimates by 5% and 11%, respectively, to $6.80 and $8.78. The stock's price target was also cut to $110 from $125. “Historically the stock has struggled to outperform when GM expansion has remained muted, leading to our stock downgrade to Neutral from Buy, even though we still feel positive about MU’s position in the HBM/AI market where TAM was taken up +20% for CY25 to $30bn.” While data center and HBM trends are highlighted as strong, the weakness in PC and phone markets continues to weigh on memory pricing, particularly NAND. BofA does, however, see potential for recovery in these markets in the latter half of 2025. Monness, Crespi, and Hardt downgraded Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) stock to Sell from Neutral, setting a 12-month price target of $130, implying over 22% upside from the current levels. The firm raised concerns about Oracle's valuation, rising competition, and aggressive capital expenditure (capex) plans. Oracle shares have climbed 60% year-to-date, largely driven by generative AI enthusiasm, marking their best performance since 1999. However, Monness analysts warned that "valuation is stretched, competition fierce, software in transition, and the macro environment fragile." Oracle's recent Q2 earnings highlighted growth challenges, the firm noted. Its FY25 EPS estimate of $6.17 remains unchanged, while its FY25 Cloud Services revenue projection has been revised to $24.9 billion, down from last year’s $25.4 billion forecast. Monness expressed particular concern over Oracle’s “bold capex plans,” with spending expected to double in FY25. "Our current FY:25 capex projection of $14.2 billion represents 24.6% of revenue, up from 13% in FY:24, and well above the 27-year average of 4%," the analysts wrote. They argue this level of expenditure is unsustainable, dragging Oracle’s free cash flow (FCF) margin to an estimated 8% for FY25, far below its historical average of 28%. The firm also pointed to Oracle’s heavily leveraged balance sheet, with $88.6 billion in debt and a debt-to-capital ratio of 86%. This restricts the company’s ability to boost shareholder returns through dividends or buybacks and limits its capacity for acquisitions or broader organic growth investments. While Oracle has seen early success in generative AI, Monness cautioned that "an inevitable shakeout in the LLM industry" and intensifying competition from major cloud providers could pose significant risks. Bank of America outlined its 2025 semiconductor outlook on Monday, spotlighting six chip stocks it recommends for investors in the coming year. The bank forecasts a 15% increase in semiconductor industry sales to $725 billion in 2025. This growth, although robust, is projected to be slower compared to the 20% growth seen in the current year. BofA anticipates memory sales to rise by 20% in 2025, following a 79% year-over-year increase in 2024, with core semiconductors, excluding memory, expected to grow by 13%. “We see 2025 as a year of two different trends. In the first half, AI investments and NVDA Blackwell deployments driven by US cloud customers sustain momentum in AI semis,” analysts led by Vivek Arya said in a note. “However, in the 2H (second half), interest could shift to less-crowded auto/industrial chipmakers on inventory replenishment and pick-up in auto production assuming a global economic recovery.” BofA’s top picks include leaders in AI such as Nvidia, Broadcom, and Marvell Technology. “In AI we continue to trust.. at least till 2H25,” analysts said. Furthermore, the firm identified Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX) as a flash-memory tool leader poised for capital expenditure recovery and impact resolution in China. Auto and EV leader ON Semiconductor (NASDAQ:ON) is highlighted for its potential cyclical recovery in the second half of 2025, and Cadence Design (NASDAQ:CDNS) Systems noted for its resilient double-digit growth, especially as the AI hardware cycle decelerates in the latter half of the year.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of 10 Buzzing AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against other buzzing AI stocks on latest news and ratings. Predictions of artificial intelligence reaching human-level intelligence have been made for over 50 years. Regardless, the quest to achieve it continues even today, with almost everyone working in the AI field being too focused on achieving it. According to Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, reaching AGI isn’t a milestone we can define by a particular date. READ ALSO: Top 12 AI Stock News and Ratings Dominating Wall Street and 10 AI Stocks Taking Wall Street by Storm “I think we’re like in this period where it’s going to feel very blurry for a while. People will wonder if is this AGI yet, or is this not AGI, or it’s just going to be this smooth exponential. And probably most people looking back in history won’t agree when that milestone was hit. And we’ll just realize it was like a silly thing”. In the latest innovations in artificial intelligence, new research has revealed how the upcoming AIs are capable of human deceit. Joint experiments conducted by AI Company Anthropic and the nonprofit Redwood Research reveal how Anthropic’s model, Claude is capable of strategically misleading its creators during the training process in order to avoid being modified. According to Evan Hubinger, a safety researcher at Anthropic, this will make it harder for scientists to align “AI systems” to human values. “This implies that our existing training processes don’t prevent models from pretending to be aligned”. Researchers have also found evidence that as AIs become more powerful, their capability to deceive their human creators also increases. Consequently, it means scientists would be less confident about the effectiveness of their alignment techniques as AI becomes more advanced. A similar research conducted by AI safety organization Apollo Research revealed how OpenAI’s latest model, o1, also intentionally deceived its testers during an experiment. The test required the model to achieve its goal at all costs, where it lied when it believed that telling the truth would ultimately lead to its deactivation. “There has been this long-hypothesized failure mode, which is that you’ll run your training process, and all the outputs will look good to you, but the model is plotting against you. The paper, Greenblatt says, “makes a pretty big step towards demonstrating what that failure mode could look like and how it could emerge naturally”. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

(NASDAQ:AVGO) is a technology company known for its custom chip offerings and networking assets. On December 17, Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari reiterated a “Buy” rating on Broadcom with a price target of $240.00. The buy rating underscores Broadcom’s promising growth trajectory and strong market position. The company’s projected opportunities in the AI semiconductor market have increased proportionally. Moreover, it has also scored new custom compute clients, reinforcing its leadership in AI Ethernet connectivity. The company also demonstrated that it manages its infrastructure software segment effectively, as evident by VMware’s operating margins. Due to these factors, Hari has increased the 12-month price target for the stock. The Semiconductor Solutions segment continues to perform well, particularly in networking revenue, bolstering the positive outlook. All in all, overall growth and strategic position in enabling next-generation AI technologies support the Buy rating for the stock. Overall, AVGO ranks 2nd on our list of buzzing AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: Nvidia stock has another 23% upside and the success of Blackwell will be the chipmaker's big story of 2025, Morgan Stanley says

Nvidia's Blackwell chip will be the company's biggest story in 2025 — and the success of the next-gen GPU will overshadow any lingering concerns investors may still have, Morgan Stanley said. In a note this week, the bank reiterated its "overweight" rating on Nvidia stock and said the chipmaker remained its "top pick" going into next year. The bank's bullishness is being fueled by the expected success of Blackwell — Nivida's next-gen artificial intelligence-enabling chip. The bank issued a price target of $166 a share, implying a 23% increase from where the stock was trading on Friday around $134.82 "We have tended to be most enthusiastic on NVIDIA when the near-term data points appear mixed, but underlying dynamics are very strong. We think we are approaching that point now," the analysts wrote in a note. "There are transitional pressures — but by 2h25 the only topic will be the strength of blackwell, in our view." Investors are already feeling bullish about the Blackwell chips, which are expected to launch in early 2025. Nvidia shares rallied earlier this year after CEO Jensen Huang said demand for the chip was "insane," boosting Wall Street's expectations for continued earnings growth. The chip will likely be the "driving force behind revenue" in the second half of next year, which could mean "significant upside for the stock," Morgan Stanley added. The success of its new chip could also dispel a handful of near- to medium-term anxieties investors have about the stock. "We think there are a number of concerns here, some of which are overstated, some of which are anxiety-inducing short term but we believe irrelevant longer term," the bank said, highlighting four issues investors have been worried about in particular. Investors are concerned about slowing builds for Hopper, Nvidia's current generation of AI chips. On its latest earnings call, the company forecast just 69.5% revenue growth for the fourth quarter, its slowest revenue forecast in seven quarters. But the slowdown in Hopper builds is a "non-issue," Morgan Stanley said. "The reason, of course, is that we are a few quarters until Hopper end of life. We would not correlate Hopper builds with Hopper revenue, which will persist for 3 more quarters or so, but there is a strong backlog of builds already coming through, so it's time to slow starts," analysts wrote. Investors may also be concerned that not all of its Blackwell products will ship at the same time. Nvidia said would release seven variants of its Blackwell GPU. "We are hearing anxiety about some of the types that aren't ready, and we aren't discounting that there may be some timing challenges with some of the product types," analysts said. They continued: "All fair, but all of the Blackwells should get sold, even if this drives allocation from one customer to another, and we think that this persists all year. This is not a concern that should linger." Concerns about Blackwell's rollout should "completely disappear" by the second half of next year, the bank said. Analysts noted that Nvidia has seen some of its value being "directly" transferred into other chipmakers in recent months. The bank pointed to companies like Broadcom and Marvel, two firms that produce ASICs, which are custom AI chips that serve as an alternative to Nvidia's GPUs. "But in 2025, we believe that the biggest users of ASICs will actually see purchasing shift back towards GPUs, based on conversations with those customers," Morgan Stanley said. "While our forecasts for both AVGO/MRVL ASIC revenue are largely conservative, as are our forecasts for GPU, we believe that GPU will meaningfully outperform ASIC this year." The big AI chip customers are seeing benefits to scaling GPU cluster sizes, which allows for more advanced computing. But some financial backers in the space are raising questions about whether the returns of doing so are worth it, the bank said. "Both constituencies matter, we can't rule out a consolidation in that portion of the market," analysts said. "But we note that many of the innovations that Nvidia has delivered in recent years are aimed at enhancing the efficiency of large clusters," they added, pointing to developments like Nvidia's acquisition of Mellanox, another chipmaker that will help it expand into the market for data center supplies. "Even with any concerns about the AGI arms race cooling down the road, the growth in inference, the growth in sovereign training, the growth in enterprise training applications, and are all multi-year growth drivers, and make up 70% or so of data center revenue, so even with some consolidation in the arms race we should still see enduring growth potential," the analysts added. Even after a 170% rally in 2024, forecasters are still generally bullish on Nvidia going into next year. The continued excitement around the AI trade in the stock market is among the top themes investors see shaping the stock market in 2025. Indices Commodities Currencies Stocks

The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed more than 800 points on Friday, buoyed by inflation data that helped the market rebound from the losses earlier this week. The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, which is regarded as the Federal Reserve’s preferred gauge of inflation, rose a modest 0.1% in November compared to the previous month. On an annual basis, the PCE price index reflected a 2.4% inflation rate — slightly above the Fed’s long-term target of 2%, but notably below analysts’ consensus estimate of 2.5%. The cooler inflation data is expected to ease concerns about persistent price pressures, raising hopes that the Fed may reduce interest rates more than twice in 2025. In the afternoon, the Dow Jones Industrial Average added over 796 points or 1.8%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq and S&P 500 jumped 1.8% each. AI stocks rebounded on Friday morning, emerging as the top-performing stocks. Nvidia (NVDA+2.41%), which experienced a sharp sell-off earlier in the week, climbed 2.3%, trading at $133 per share. Shares of Super Micro Computer (SMCI+0.79%) and Broadcom (AVGO+5.10%) were up 4.3% and 3.7%, respectively. Bitcoin sunk below $92,000 early Friday before recovering some ground on the heels of the Federal Reserve signaling a slowdown in interest rate cuts for 2025. The leading cryptocurrency was hovering around $96,000 on Friday morning, down about 7.7% over the past day. Bitcoin has slumped more than 10% since the start of the week when it hit highs of more than $106,000. – Rocio Fabbro contributed to this article Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stock futures pointed to another rough day on Wall Street Friday after the House of Representatives voted against a Trump-backed spending bill, further increasing the odds of a US government shutdown this weekend. Investors also digested key inflation data that showed a deceleration in price increases during the month of November after the Federal Reserve lowered the number of cuts it expects next year. Markets improved throughout the morning but futures tied to the S&P 500 (ES=F) still dropped around 0.5%, while those on the tech-heavy Nasdaq (NQ=F) plunged 0.8%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures (YM=F) also fell around 0.2%. A Fed-induced sell-off earlier in the week left the major averages reeling. And although stocks mostly stabilized on Thursday, the threat of a government shutdown, coupled with more Trump tariff threats on Europe, pressured global markets across the board. "I told the European Union that they must make up their tremendous deficit with the United States by the large scale purchase of our oil and gas," Trump said in a post on Truth Social. "Otherwise, it is TARIFFS all the way!!!" Global chip stocks sold off premarket, with Europe's ASML (ASML) dropping nearly 2% early Friday while Taiwan's TSMC (TSMC34.SA) fell about 3%. US-based names such as Nvidia (NVDA), AMD (AMD), and Broadcom (AVGO) also came under pressure. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices retreated nearly 10% from earlier highs to drop below the critical $100,000 mark amid record ETF outflows. And in individual names, Novo Nordisk (NVO) plunged about 20% — the most in over two decades — after its obesity drug trial disappointed investors. Tesla (TSLA) shares dropped 6% after recalling about 700,000 US vehicles over a tire pressure monitoring system defect. Meanwhile, investors received another piece of the inflation puzzle with the release of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index. The latest reading showed price increases fell month over month in November but still remained sticky as the central bank fights to bring inflation back down to its 2% target. In November, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which strips out food and energy costs and is closely tracked by the Fed, rose 0.1% from the prior month, a deceleration from October's 0.3% monthly gain in prices. The monthly increase came in slightly lower compared to economist expectations of a 0.2% increase. Over the prior year, core prices rose 2.8%, matching the increase seen in October and also lower than Wall Street's expectations of a 2.9% rise. On a yearly basis, overall PCE increased 2.4%, a pickup from the 2.3% seen in October. Economists polled by Bloomberg had anticipated a yearly increase of 2.5%. The latest reading of the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge showed price increases fell month over month in November but still remained sticky as the central bank fights to bring inflation back down to its 2% target. The data, released early Friday by Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), comes after the central bank slashed interest rates by 25 basis points at its last policy meeting of the year on Wednesday. Officials also signaled less easing to come in 2025 with inflation expected to remain elevated over the longterm. In November, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which strips out food and energy costs and is closely tracked by the Fed, rose 0.1% from the prior month, a deceleration from October's 0.3% monthly gain in prices.

Investors this morning will closely be monitoring a key inflation report set to shape future monetary policy. The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which strips out volatile food and energy costs, is expected to have risen 0.2% month over month in November after prices rose 0.3% in October, according to Bloomberg data. Over the prior year, Wall Street expects core prices to rise 2.9%, ahead of the 2.8% gain seen in October. Overall PCE is expected to increase 2.5% year over year, an acceleration from October's 2.3% annual increase. The report, which will be released at 8:30 a.m. ET, comes after the central bank slashed interest rates by 25 basis points at its last policy meeting of the year on Wednesday. Officials also signaled less easing to come in 2025 with inflation expected to remain elevated over the longterm. Earlier this month, the core Consumer Price Index (CPI), which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, saw prices in November climb 3.3% over last year for the fourth consecutive month. Meanwhile, the core Producer Price Index (PPI), which tracks the price changes companies see, revealed prices increased by 3.4% annually in November. That's up from a 3.1% jump in October and also ahead of economist expectations of a 3.2% increase. In a press conference following Wednesday's interest rate decision, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that the last mile of the Fed's fight to curb inflation has been more challenging than central bank leaders initially projected. "We've had a year-end projection for inflation, and it's kind of fallen apart as we approach the end of the year," Powell said. "I can tell you that might be the single biggest factor — inflation has once again underperformed relative to expectations."

Title: How innovation died at Intel: America's only leading-edge chip manufacturer faces an uncertain future and lawsuits

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Intel's (INTC) fall from grace seemed to happen all at once. Shares of the once iconic chipmaker plummeted 60% in 2024. The company posted the biggest loss in its 56-year history in its latest quarterly earnings report. Its market cap has dropped 80% since 2000 — when it was one of the most valuable companies in the world. In November, an ascendant Nvidia (NVDA) replaced Intel in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. A month later, CEO Pat Gelsinger resigned after taking the helm in February 2021. And on Wednesday the company was hit with yet another lawsuit filed by shareholders — this time seeking damages related to substantial losses from its struggling foundry division. But company insiders and industry analysts tell Yahoo Finance that Intel's dramatic crash is the result of a slow deterioration spanning more than two decades. “They had a God complex; they were super arrogant,” a former high-level executive who worked at Intel for more than 20 years told Yahoo Finance. “They felt like they had such a large competitive advantage that they could never do anything wrong.” The cause of Intel’s decay? A culture of complacency, short-term thinking, and lack of execution, all while its rivals got better. Today, Intel is hemorrhaging share in the very market it created, losing customers to AMD (AMD), Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari told Yahoo Finance. The x86 architecture underpinning Intel and AMD's products is, in turn, losing share to British chip designer Arm (ARM), according to Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon. Those chips altogether — CPUs, or central processing units — are existentially threatened by the rise of AI-focused GPUs, or graphics processing units, a market dominated by Nvidia. And its fledgling foundry business is bleeding cash while competitors snatch fat contracts leveraging machine technology that Intel once funded. In 2024, Nvidia's stock is up 173%, while Arm, Broadcom (AVGO), and TSMC (TSM) clocked 93%, 101%, and 92% gains, respectively. Yahoo Finance spoke with half a dozen Wall Street analysts and experts and more than a dozen current and former employees (including high-level executives who were at the company for over a decade) for an inside look at Intel's failures and its future as America's only leading-edge chip manufacturer. The employees were granted anonymity due to non-disclosure agreements and fear of jeopardizing future employment opportunities. In a statement to Yahoo Finance, an Intel spokesperson said, "We are executing with rigor on our plan to rebuild product and process leadership and improve our profitability. The work we are doing to strengthen our product portfolio, combined with our disciplined focus on driving returns on our foundry investments, supports our long-term strategy to deliver sustainable financial performance and unlock shareholder value.” As the rise of Arm-based chips and AI GPUs eroded Intel's standing, Pat Gelsinger promised to turn things around by launching a foundry business — leveraging Intel's manufacturing capabilities to make chips for external customers. The move was intended to bring back bold, innovative thinking — a "Grovian" mindset, referring to its famed former CEO Andy Grove. Some say it was Gelsinger’s best bet. “I think it's the right move because without looking outside the company and pursuing external customers, it's a shrinking company,” Hari said. Others were skeptical of the approach. Multiple analysts and insiders said the decline of Intel’s product business handcuffed its ability to fund Gelsinger’s aggressive capital spending and hiring sprees — which gave way to layoffs that depressed morale. Several employees commended what they described as Gelsinger’s brilliance and good character: One posted on LinkedIn about Gelsinger helping his grandson access medications to treat a fatal genetic disease. Others contended that Gelsinger set expectations too high, then acted more as a cheerleader than executor and refused to listen to input that didn’t align with his vision. Gelsinger’s stated target when he became CEO was to have Intel’s foundry generating $15 billion in revenue by 2030 — roughly double the $8.5 billion Samsung generated last year after nearly two decades of operation, according to Gartner data cited by Rasgon. In its most recent quarter, Intel’s net loss totaled $16.6 billion due to substantial losses in its chip manufacturing division. “Intel has not demonstrated that they can execute on foundry … because they don't have a track record and the track record that you've seen from their internal execution has been so flawed,” KeyBanc analyst John Vinh told Yahoo Finance. “It's hard for anyone to commit any major mission-critical applications for them. And as a result of that, Intel is not going to pick up any sort of meaningful business.” Its last hope to right a sinking ship has been called into question. Under Gelsinger, Intel staked its fate on a new advanced manufacturing process called 18A — which the company’s corporate vice president Bruce Andrews told the Financial Times in November would “bring [the company] back to technological leadership.” The process would allow Intel to manufacture the most advanced AI chips with tiny components tens of thousands of times smaller than the size of a human body cell. Intel initially said it would begin high-volume production with its 18A process in the first half of 2025, then moved that target to the second half of next year, according to its third quarter earnings call. Internal testing of 18A earlier this year reportedly showed it wasn’t ready for high-volume production. A current employee at one of Intel’s fabs told Yahoo Finance there are “a lot of issues” making chips with the 18A process. They said that Intel is not ready to take on external customers and that communications between teams that should take days often take weeks as employees avoid responsibility for mishaps. Intel declined a request to comment on 18A, but pointed to recent commentary from its temporary co-CEO Michelle Johnston Holthaus stating that 18A is on track to roll out by the end of 2025. Meanwhile, Intel has already purchased at least $760 million worth of machinery for its successor manufacturing process to 18A, called 14A. Gelsinger was ousted on Dec. 1 by Intel’s board, which has been criticized as “extremely weak” and lacking “hardened semiconductor people” by sources Yahoo Finance spoke to. Notably, the board added two leading semiconductor experts days after Gelsinger's exit. Intel’s technology is, in large part, responsible for the digital revolution. Its co-founder Bob Noyce has the greatest claim to the founding of Silicon Valley, according to semiconductor expert Chris Miller, author of “Chip War.” The company invented the world’s first microprocessors (i.e. computer chips) and the x86 architecture (a critical blueprint for designing computer chips). Its other co-founder, Gordon Moore, created “Moore’s Law,” a theory that defined the pace of innovation in the semiconductor industry for more than half a century. But after the dot-com bust, Intel invested in multiple projects that never materialized or failed to reach their potential. Two former executives told Yahoo Finance that innovative efforts were often killed if they didn't immediately contribute to revenue or risked cannibalizing existing products. One former high-level executive, who worked within several divisions, said Intel didn't support the team working on low-power Atom chips for mobile phones in the early 2000s. It sold its license for Xscale, then Arm's most advanced architecture for mobile chips, to Marvell (MRVL) in 2006. Paul Otellini, who served as CEO from 2005 to 2013, also passed on making chips for the initial Apple iPhone. Instead, Intel bet on Nokia — “a spectacular failure in terms of strategic decision making,” a former executive said. Its manufacturing division opted to use a technique called multiple patterning rather than investing in EUV (extreme ultraviolet) lithography machines, which use incredibly complex technology from Dutch company ASML (ASML) that was only made possible by funding from Intel in the late 1990s and early 2000s. TSMC and Samsung (005930.KS) successfully adopted EUV lithography first, vital to today's advanced chipmaking. Meanwhile, a former high-level executive said Intel had 10 EUV machines worth more than $1 billion in 2019 that it wasn't fully utilizing. Six former executives pointed to poor leadership as the source of many problems. They said Gelsinger's predecessors Brian Krzanich (known as “BK”) and Bob Swan prioritized short-term thinking over long-term technology strategies. The two served from 2013 to 2018 and 2018 to 2021, respectively. Intel fumbled multiple attempts to enter what would become the AI chip market. In 2009, it scrapped a project codenamed Larrabee, led by then-chief technology officer Gelsinger, which aimed to develop a standalone GPU like Nvidia's. In 2017, Intel hired AMD’s graphics chip engineer, Raja Koduri, to lead a second effort toward a homegrown GPU. Three former executives say Koduri had a strong vision but was weak on execution. Koduri told Yahoo Finance, "As member of executive leadership team, I did bear the accountability of overall execution. Being criticized given my responsibility is true but, given the factors at play, is unkind to the engineering team that executed against all odds." At the same time, Intel acquired Habana Labs to develop another type of AI chip called an ASIC accelerator. But the effort wasn't prioritized due to internal politics, according to an executive who helped oversee the acquisition. “Their focus on Nvidia, who is the real enemy, was simply not there,” the source said. “They were like …crabs fighting amongst themselves.” To add insult to injury, Intel missed opportunities to acquire Nvidia and invest in OpenAI. Meanwhile, rivals were improving rapidly. TSMC began manufacturing iPhone chips in 2014, and Apple ditched Intel after creating its own MacBook chips using Arm's architecture. Nvidia spent nearly two decades developing the technology used in its AI chips before they took off in earnest. ASML spent 17 years creating its EUV lithography systems that gave it an effective monopoly over the tech required to make Nvidia chips. By the time generative AI sparked a new era of tech boom, Intel had been left in the dust. Chipmaking is becoming an increasingly important national security issue as US-China relations deteriorate. The US government is betting on Intel, sinking nearly $8 billion in CHIPS Act funding into the company’s existing and future foundries. But the money adds to Intel's conundrum: Its product business would be better off outsourcing all chipmaking to TSMC, Hari said, but that would leave its manufacturing division with no revenue. Analysts from Citi, KeyBanc, Raymond James, and others say Intel should spin off or divest its foundry business, but it has to maintain a 50.1% stake to keep its CHIPS Act funding. “There don’t seem to be any easy answers here, so whoever winds up filling the [CEO] slot looks in for a tough ride,” Rasgon wrote in a client note. Intel's revenue for the upcoming quarter is expected to fall more than 10% year over year to $13.8 billion, per Bloomberg consensus estimates, and earnings per share are projected to drop 77% to $0.12. The company named CFO David Zinsner and former head of client computing Michelle Johnston Holthaus as interim co-CEOs, with Holthaus heading the newly formed Intel Products division. Two former high-level executives critiqued the move, with one saying Holthaus has "no technical skill." " To put these co-CEOs in shows you they had no succession plan," Rasgon told Yahoo Finance. He said the CEO " everybody wants" to see is Lip-Bu Tan, the former CEO of Cadence Design Systems, who is reportedly a candidate. Tan also sits on the board of Gelsinger's Christian organization. Zinsner and Holthaus did not respond to Yahoo Finance's requests for comment. During UBS's Technology and AI Conference in Arizona on Dec. 4, Zinsner said Intel remains committed to its foundry business. " [We] still want to be a world-class foundry, want to be the western provider of leading-edge silicon to customers," he said. One former executive said the best pick for Intel's permanent CEO should be a " hardcore" chips expert who understands the technology. Another agreed — but indicated the person needs to be an outsider. "Nobody in the Intel Technology Development Group, who's either at the top level or one level down, would even have a seat at the table anywhere in the first three levels of management at TSMC," said the former executive who worked in Intel's foundry. While the government is funding the expansion of TSMC’s and Samsung’s foundries in the US, the vast majority of those companies’ manufacturing capacity is in their home countries of Taiwan and South Korea, per Miller. That's seen by some as a national security risk in case of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. But "that doesn't automatically make Intel the solution," Rasgon said. " We can throw all the money we want at Intel, it doesn't necessarily fix the problem," he added. Nearly 80% of analysts tracked by Yahoo Finance, including Rasgon, have a Hold rating on the stock, with an average price target of $24 over the next 12 months. "I don't envy the new CEO," one former executive said. "How many leading-edge silicon providers can the world afford? Is it two or is it three? If it's three, then you'd say, 'OK, as long as they get their manufacturing technology up, it'll be OK.' If it's two, then ... who's going to die as a foundry, Intel or Samsung?"

Title: This Is Not Broadcom’s ‘Nvidia Moment’ Yet
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bethkindig/2024/12/19/this-is-not-broadcoms-nvidia-moment-yet/
Time Published: 2024-12-19T21:05:23Z
Full Content:
Broadcom’s stock surged 35% in two days despite a mediocre Q4, as management offered investors a picturesque addressable market forecast for 2027. Q4 was not the blowout report the market made it out to be, as Broadcom fell just short of revenue estimates while guiding Q1 barely above consensus. Despite this, the market did solidify that momentum continues to build for AI stocks entering 2025. Broadcom’s commentary on the call as to the serviceable addressable market for its two leading AI segments, custom silicon and networking, is why the stock moved a whopping 25%. As a reminder, a serviceable addressable market refers to market size the company can service, and is not a forecast of the company’s revenue. While Broadcom gave investors a reason to dream, it’s not the stock’s ‘Nvidia moment’ despite the surge in the stock price resembling Nvidia’s 2023 breakout. Instead, Broadcom is reporting flat QoQ AI revenue with the 200% year-over-year number being old news (Broadcom had guided for $12B in AI revenue in Q3 and only marginally beat that figure). CHINA - 2023/11/03: In this photo illustration, the American developer, manufacturer, and global ... [+] supplier of semiconductor and software products, Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ: AVGO), logo seen displayed on a smartphone with an Artificial intelligence (AI) chip and symbol in the background. (Photo Illustration by Budrul Chukrut/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Among the AI titans, Broadcom is the one of the only stocks to see lumpy AI growth, reporting flat AI revenue growth from Q2 to Q3 – with expectations it remains at a mere 3% QoQ growth to start fiscal 2025. This occurred roughly a month before tariffs are likely to affect its top customer – Apple. Below, I provide data that shows the move in Broadcom’s stock was premature, creating outsized pressure on Broadcom to live up to AI juggernaut Nvidia in 2025, which is unrealistic given Broadcom has only ~25% of revenue from AI versus 80% of revenue from Nvidia. When you factor in 30%+ of Broadcom’s revenue comes from China, versus Nvidia at 15% for China exposure, what you have is an upside down scenario for Broadcom where tariffs could negatively impact more revenue than what AI is currently providing. The Street is desperate to find the next Nvidia in the vast and complex sector of semiconductors and hardware providers. There were many raises/beats across AI-related semiconductors, including from many small, lesser-known names. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s report was one of the least spectacular as there was a very rare miss for Q4 revenue and a Q1 guide that was only $30 million above consensus. Growth is challenged sequentially, with Q1 only set to grow 4% QoQ. Semiconductor revenue was seen declining nearly -2% sequentially as well, with management guiding for $8.1 billion in Q1 versus $8.23 billion in Q4. AI revenue was not much of a surprise either, as Broadcom had guided for full-year AI revenue of $12 billion in Q3, coming in not even 2% above the guide. To offset the lackluster performance, the management team painted a picture for AI revenue growth to scale quickly with a tantalizing addressable market forecast for 2027. Here’s what CEO Hock Tan said that energized the stock: “We currently have three hyper-scale customers who have developed their own multi-generational AI XPU roadmap to be deployed at varying rates over the next three years. In 2027, we believe each of them plans to deploy 1 million XPU clusters across a single fabric. We expect this to represent an AI revenue Serviceable Addressable Market, or SAM, for XPUs and networking in the range of $60 billion to $90 billion in fiscal 2027 alone. We are very well positioned to achieve a leading market share in this opportunity and expect this will drive a strong ramp from our 2024 AI revenue base of $12.2 billion. Keep in mind though, this will not be a linear ramp.” Tan also added that Broadcom was in advanced development with two additional hyperscalers, rumored to be ByteDance and OpenAI, with possibilities to turn both into revenue generating customers before 2027. The comments the ramp will not be linear likely refers to the ramp being back-half weighted, with the majority of revenue being recognized between 2026-2027. On the call, it was mentioned that its 3nm custom silicon will ship in the second half of 2025. Meanwhile, Broadcom is trading at an astronomical valuation that is higher than Nvidia’s. In fact, Broadcom is up against its toughest year yet as Nvidia’s Blackwell systems are set to raise the bar competitively with custom silicon as powerful Blackwell systems combining 36 CPUs and up to 72 GPUs ship in volume in Q1 with a bigger ramp in Q2 of 2025. The 72 GPUs in the NVL72 will be used as a single accelerator for 1.4 exaflops of AI compute power. Nvidia’s proprietary NVLink Switch will reach 130 TB/second, which is “more than the aggregate bandwidth of the internet.” Outside of narrow use cases, custom silicon will not be able to compete with Nvidia in 2025, whereas in future years, custom silicon may have more of an opportunity to catch up. For example, when comparing with Nvidia’s 2023-2024 Hopper generation, Amazon’s Trainium2 instances with 100,000 processors “equals around 32,768 Nvidia H100 processors,” according to Tom’s Hardware. This helps to paint a picture as to why custom silicon revenue for Broadcom is at a low $300 million per quarter in custom silicon revenue compared to Nvidia’s $27 billion per quarter on GPUs (removing the $3 billion Nvidia makes in networking from the data center segment). Going back to the comment of a $75 billion serviceable market by 2027, at the midpoint - let’s put this opportunity in perspective. For 2024, Broadcom reported AI revenue of $12.2 billion, up 220% YoY from $3.8 billion in 2023. As stated, this was guided in Q3 and was not a beat/raise or news to anyone who covers the stock. CEO Hock Tan said he believes Broadcom’s current serviceable AI market is worth $15 billion to $20 billion this year, suggesting that Broadcom commands approximately 70% market share at the midpoint of that range. Broadcom serves two major markets in AI – custom accelerators which Broadcom is referring to as XPUs, and networking and switches, ripe with competition from Nvidia, Arista, Cisco, and others. It will certainly not be a straightforward path for Broadcom to maintain what it sees as a 70% share of these addressable AI markets. Nvidia is arguably a strong contender in networking with InfiniBand and is moving into ethernet with Spectrum-X, while there are many other networking suppliers involved with Broadcom’s hyperscale customers. As pointed out by the CEO regarding the serviceable addressable market: “There's room for many players. All we are going to do is gain our fair share.” Assuming Broadcom can reach 60% share at a $75B addressable market size, that correlates to approximately $45 billion in AI revenue in 2027, or nearly 3.7x growth over the next three years. In other words, that would require AI revenue growth of ~55% annually through 2027. While hyperscaler capex definitely supports such a ramp, this growth pales in comparison to the numbers Nvidia has been putting up. Meanwhile, Broadcom does not have the moat that Nvidia has, which I pointed out five years ago is the CUDA development platform. Nvidia is currently on track for approximately $114 billion in data center revenue in fiscal 2025, up 140% YoY and up 661% from fiscal 2023. In fiscal 2027, Nvidia is expected to generate nearly $220 billion in data center revenue, or nearly 8x higher than Broadcom’s AI revenue estimate of $29 billion. This would be about 36% of revenue at the consensus estimate for $80 billion, which pales in comparison to the 80% range Nvidia has, and AI server makers, with one expected to see up to 40% of revenue from AI next year. The I/O Fund previewed Nvidia’s path to a $200 billion data center segment in May 2024 for its free newsletter readers for gains of 39% since then, and gains of 2,550% since first calling out Nvidia’s AI GPU thesis and CUDA moat in November 2018. Premium members receive real-time trade alerts and analysis on numerous other AI data center beneficiaries. Learn more here. Broadcom capped off fiscal 2024 with nearly 150% YoY growth in AI revenue to $3.7 billion, with networking the primary contributor. QoQ growth was ~20% in Q4, rebounding from flat QoQ growth in Q3; however, Q1 is expected to see QoQ growth decelerate to the low single-digits. Here’s what Broadcom’s quarterly AI revenue growth has looked like: Broadcom's quarterly AI revenue reached $3.7 billion in Q4, after remaining flat QoQ at $3.1 billion ... [+] in Q3. The non-linear, bumpy ramp the CEO referenced is quite visible – sequential growth was flat in Q3, and for Q1, management’s guide for $3.8 billion in AI revenue points to sequential growth of under 3%. Meanwhile, Nvidia has grown data center revenue by $4 billion sequentially for four consecutive quarters – Nvidia’s sequential growth alone more than outpaces Broadcom’s total quarterly AI revenue. For Q4, management said that they saw growth from both AI accelerators and networking, though not at the same rate. Networking component shipments were much higher in the back half of the year, with this strength continuing into the first half of next year. Management provided some additional growth figures for AI networking, with revenue up 158% YoY, driven by 4x growth in AI connectivity revenue from Tomahawk and Jericho shipments. AI networking contributed 76% of networking revenue, implying AI networking revenue of ~$3.4 billion, and custom accelerator revenue of ~$300 million in Q4. While custom accelerator accounted for just a small portion of AI revenue in the quarter, management foresees strong growth in the second half of 2025. Broadcom is set to begin and quickly ramp shipments of its next-gen 3 nanometer AI ASICs to hyperscaler customers in the second half of the year. Broadcom had previously laid out a path to 1 million accelerator clusters deployed by 2027, and re-emphasized that path in Q4’s earnings call. That’s essentially tenfold growth from the current 100K cluster sizes being deployed today. While that no doubt this will correlate into tremendous growth in accelerator shipments for Broadcom, Nvidia, AMD, and lesser-known ASICs design companies, Broadcom put emphasis on the need for networking to scale up to this degree. The I/O Fund specializes in covering lesser-known AI stocks on our research site with trade alerts and weekly webinars. Learn more here. Piper Sandler analyst Harlan Sur asked management about the dollar content for networking vs custom accelerators, and what the attach rate of networking per accelerator would be (ie. $1 networking for $1 in accelerators). CEO Hock Tan explained that “the simple ratio to look at is there is scale up and there is scale out. And as we expand into a single fabric cluster of XPUs or GPU that grows bigger and bigger, guess what is more important. Scale up becomes more and more important. And the ratio we are talking about as we move up increases almost exponentially, which is why I'm saying from networking, as a percent of AI content in silicon today of between 5% to 10%, you're going up to 15% to 20% by the time you hit 500,000 to 1 million XPU GPU clusters.” This is because of the increasing demands for networking and switches to connect exponentially larger clusters, from spine to leaf in the front end and back end, rack to rack and accelerator to accelerator. With that said, Nvidia and Broadcom are neck-and-neck in networking revenue with Nvidia at $3.13 billion for Q3 and Broadcom at $3.42 billion. This year, Nvidia will be increasing its networking content and ramping Spectrum X, it’s Ethernet networking platform. The opportunity beckons with AI cluster sizes set to grow tenfold or more over the next three years as hyperscalers build and deploy ever-larger data centers, however, this is decidedly not Broadcom’s ‘Nvidia moment’ yet. What separates the two is actual, numerical data. Nvidia’s Hopper-driven breakout towards the $1 trillion market cap milestone in May 2023 came on the back of a ‘jaw dropping’ guide higher — it reported revenue of $7.2 billion for fiscal Q1 2024 (versus $6.5 billion estimated). The company guided for $11 billion in Q2 while analysts were expecting just $7.2 billion. Nvidia ultimately beat that guide as it reported $13.5 billion in revenue in Q2. Since then, in just six quarters, Nvidia’s quarterly revenue has grown 5x from $7.2 billion to $35.1 billion, with $1 billion-plus beats each quarter along the way. Nvidia's quarterly revenue has risen more than 5x since fiscal Q1 2024 with $1 billion-plus beats in ... [+] the last six quarters. Broadcom, on the other hand, slightly missed revenue estimates this quarter and guided Q1 only marginally above consensus. AI revenue of $12.2 billion also came in just $0.2 billion above management’s forecast for $12 billion given in Q3; not exactly the out-of-the-ballpark blowout that Nvidia consistently put up quarter after quarter. The difference between the two is quite clear: Nvidia's sequential data center growth has totaled more than Broadcom's quarterly AI revenue in each ... [+] of the last four quarters. Broadcom has the potential to capture a large part of a rapidly growing market in AI networking and custom silicon for hyperscalers, and cement itself as the #2 in AI semiconductor stock ahead of AMD, but it requires some speculation. Broadcom has to prove that this market opportunity is theirs for the taking, and they will have to take it in full force and lay down the foundation for AI revenue to grow into that SAM – that is, to grow nearly 4x to $45 billion in AI revenue over the next three years (60% share of a $75B SAM). Broadcom’s cloud software is executing well with VMWare’s integration almost fully complete, and cost synergies and operating efficiencies being realized, but AI hardware and networking is where Broadcom needs to prove it can sustain its large market size in an environment growing fiercely competitive. For example, Arista is targeting AI networking revenue of $1.5 billion and another competitor is forecasting $2.5 billion for AI networking and custom silicon in 2025, while Nvidia’s networking revenue is well above a $12 billion annual run rate with Spectrum-X ramping. Regarding Spectrum-X, investors should take note that AI juggernaut Nvidia is entering the Ethernet market for the first time, following the success of InfiniBand. Thus, Broadcom’s lofty 70% market share is likely to come under serious pressure as Nvidia expects Spectrum-X to become a multi-billion dollar product within the next year. This boils down to valuation – Broadcom’s surge to $250, up 40% in one week, has pushed the chipmaker to trade at its first ever premium to Nvidia since its merger with Avago in 2016, and a rather large premium at that. Both of the two have strong bottom lines, but Broadcom is now trading at 35.3x NTM earnings of $6.35, whereas Nvidia is trading at 33.1x NTM earnings of $3.95. Broadcom is also trading at a slight premium on the topline, at 18.3x NTM revenue, versus 17.9x for Nvidia. Broadcom is strong on margins, though not nearly as strong as Nvidia – the operating margin of 31.9% in Q4 was slightly over half of Nvidia’s 62.3%, with a net margin of 29.8% versus Nvidia’s 55.0%. Despite the lower custom silicon revenue that needs to ramp and the highly competitive networking market, a lesser-known AI angle for Broadcom is the VMWare acquisition is paying off in spades... infrastructure software was up 196% with the acquisition now largely complete, and operating margins are an impressive 72% in this segment. Infrastructure growth was guided at 41% YoY for Q1, contributing nearly 45% of revenue, providing more robust margin tailwinds to complement AI semiconductor growth over the next couple of years. The synergies from AI-driven high-growth, high-margin infrastructure software and expectations for a rapid ramp in AI semiconductor revenue through 2027 could make Broadcom a compelling AI name, provided the price is right. Broadcom (AVGO) broke out to new highs on heavy buying volume based on the results from their recent earnings report. A vertical move on heavy volume is everyone realizing at the same time the direction of the trend – shorts cover, and longs buy, causing the type of vertical price action exhibited below. These moves tend to be the 3rd waves in a 5 wave uptrend, which is what I believe AVGO just completed. There are currently two scenarios based on the price action that the I/O Fund is tracking: Broadcom (AVGO) broke out to new highs on heavy buying volume based on the results from their resent ... [+] earnings report. There was significant institutional activity in the $250, $240, and $224 regions. As price is notable below these regions, it implies that institutions sold at the recent highs. If these levels contain any bounce, it will further confirm that the 3rd wave is over, which support the Blue count. If $212.50 does break, confirming this scenario, as long as the 4th wave drop holds $157, the I/O Fund would see this drop as a buying opportunity. Broadcom’s premium valuation coupled with a fraction of Nvidia’s AI revenue —- not to mention flat QoQ AI revenue growth for nearly three quarters —- is why this is not yet Broadcom’s Nvidia moment. Broadcom must now prove to the market that it can deliver on its promise and maintain its premium to the undisputed AI leader heading into 2025 with Blackwell’s fireworks show about to start. Supply chain and demand signals point to 2025 being another strong year for Nvidia as Blackwell comes to market, with the I/O Fund tracking these data points to assess Nvidia’s growth potential in the year to come. The I/O Fund is also closely analyzing the supply chain to identify overlooked beneficiaries of the AI infrastructure buildout, sharing this information as well as buy and sell plans and real time trade alerts with premium members. The I/O Fund recently entered two separate beneficiaries for gains of 23% and 17% since November. Learn more here.

Nvidia stock (NVDA) jumped as much as 2.7% early Thursday as Wall Street analysts reiterated their Buy ratings on the stock despite concerns about rising competition and the possibility that artificial intelligence chip demand could wane. Over the past few days, Wall Street analysts at Bernstein, TD Cowen, Morgan Stanley, and Truist have maintained bullish outlooks on the company. “All relevant industry contacts support the dominance and superiority of NVDA's full technology stack,” Truist Securities’ William Stein wrote on Monday. He raised his price target on the stock to $204 from $169. Following the nods from Wall Street, Nvidia shares rallied as much as 4.8% Wednesday. But the stock later reversed direction, ending the day down roughly 1%, as stocks fell across the board following commentary from the Federal Reserve projecting fewer rate cuts and stickier inflation in 2025. Even with Thursday's early morning gain, Nvidia stock is still off roughly 11% from its record close of $148.88 in early November. Nvidia shares have fallen as investors worry its GPUs could lose share in the broader AI chip market given that its customers are developing their own custom chips. Google (GOOG) and Meta (META) have developed chips with Broadcom (AVGO). Microsoft (MSFT), Tesla (TSLA), and Amazon (AMZN) also make their own custom chips. Broadcom’s announcement that it’s developing chips for two more clients, who are believed to be ChatGPT-maker OpenAI and Apple (AAPL), boosted the chipmaker’s stock last week and sent Nvidia’s in the opposite direction. These custom chips, called ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits), could potentially threaten Nvidia’s GPUs, given that they are cheaper and tailored to a tech company’s specific AI needs. A Morgan Stanley report released on Dec. 15 showed that custom chips used to run cloud AI services could grow their share of the overall AI chip market from 11% in 2024 to 15% in 2030. Still, Morgan Stanley said, “history is certainly on Nvidia's side” when it comes to maintaining dominance of the AI chip market. “We think ASICs have continued to improve, but Nvidia's strong execution continues to raise the bar for its competitors." It's a point on Nvidia that Bank of America semiconductor analyst Vivek Arya reiterated Wednesday in an episode of the Opening Bid podcast (video above). Additionally, concerns loom that the Big Tech spending on AI chips that fueled Nvidia's rise could slow down. Commentary from Microsoft and Google in their most recent earnings reports indicated that their AI spending will grow at a slower pace in the future. And there are concerns that AI models are no longer improving at their previous breakneck pace, which could also put a damper on investment. TD Cowen analyst Joshua Buchalter said the firm's recent meeting with Nvidia showed the chipmaker is aware of that concern but "remains confident in the industry's ability to progress and continue to innovate." Stein also believes Nvidia will announce a standalone CPU, or central processing unit — the “brain” of a computer, distinct from Nvidia’s Hopper and Blackwell GPUs, or graphics processing units — in 2025, opening up what he sees as a $35 billion market opportunity. Nvidia currently uses its Arm-based Grace CPUs alongside its Blackwell GPUs in servers it sells to customers but does not sell CPUs individually. Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia Corporation (NVDA, Financials) in the year thus far is up approximately 182% on last look, positioning it at the forefront of U.S.-listed semiconductor companies. Its developments in artificial intelligence technologiesincluding the H100 Tensor Core GPUs necessary for training big language models like ChatGPT and the RTX 40 Series GPUs targeted at gamers and creative professionalshelp to explain this spike. Strategic alliances with big cloud companies such Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure have strengthened Nvidia's market share even further. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with NVDA. With profits of $18.1 billion in the third quarter of 2024, Nvidia recorded a 206% annual year-over-year (YoY) net income of $9.2 billion, up 472% YoY. Especially, data center goods generated more than 70% of this income, which emphasizes the company's emphasis on artificial intelligence-driven applications. With a YTD increase of around 114%, Broadcom Inc. (AVGO, Financials) has also seen notable expansion. Tomahawk 5 Ethernet devices and the company's own application-specific integrated circuits have driven data center workloads in considerable part. In the fourth quarter of 2024 Broadcom disclosed revenue of $9.8 billion, a 15% YoY increase, and net income of $3.7 billion; the company forecasts $3 billion in revenue from AI-related products for the fiscal year 2024. About 92.5% YTD increase has been recorded by Marvell Technology (MRVL, Financials). In artificial intelligence storage and cloud computing, the company's Bravera SC5 SSD controllers and Octeon 10 DPU series have become very popular. Marvell said net income of $220 million, an 11% YoY rise, and profits of $1.53 billion in the third quarter of 2024. By 2025, the business forecasts that items connected to artificial intelligence will make thirty percent of its income. With a YTD increase of around 33%, Micron Technology (MU, Financials) is on a high as well. Along with new DDR5 DRAM products in great demand for cloud and business industries, the firm unveiled HBM3 memory chips specifically for high-bandwidth artificial intelligence and high-performance computer uses. Attributed to inventory write-downs, Micron achieved income of $6.1 billion even though the fourth quarter of 2024 had a net loss of $895 million. Adoption of artificial intelligence is expected by the corporation to balance demand for its goods and price. This article first appeared on GuruFocus. Sign in to access your portfolio

Title: 6 Best ETFs To Buy And Invest In 2025

getty Megacap stocks dominated in 2024, creating nice returns for anyone invested in the Nasdaq-100 and S&P 500. Unfortunately, no financial market trend lasts forever. Many pundits believe the megacap growth could pause in 2025, leaving room for other stock market segments to take the lead. If you agree with that prediction, you may need to reset your exchange-traded fund portfolio for the year ahead. Let's explore three critical ETF selection criteria and meet six ETFs that may be winners in 2025. You have many ETF options available, and choosing the right one can be overwhelming. To keep your search efficient, focus on low-expense funds that deliver the appropriate risk and market exposure. ETFs have administrative expenses that they pass on to shareholders. The funds disclose these expenses as an expense ratio. The ratio is a percentage representing shareholders' annual expense burden. In 2016, Morningstar published a white paper stating that the "expense ratio is the most proven predictor of future fund returns." The paper included the recommendation that investors evaluate expense ratios early in their selection process. That recommendation still stands today. Only one of the ETFs introduced below has an expense ratio above 0.04%. A 0.04% expense ratio equates to $4 in expenses annually for every $10,000 invested. Managing risk according to what you can handle is a primary investing responsibility. Too much or too little risk undermines your commitment to the strategy. Whether your portfolio is too volatile or too conservative, the common reaction is the same: You'll want to change things. Emotional decision-making can result and returns can suffer. So, think about the risk level you want, with the understanding that risk and reward go together. High risk means greater earnings potential but with volatility. Low risk means less volatility and lower gain potential. Market exposure refers to the types of assets the fund holds. For example, a fund that replicates the S&P 500, which includes 500 of the largest public companies, has large-cap exposure. A fund that holds Nasdaq-100 stocks has large-cap technology exposure. Your targeted exposure should align with your risk tolerance.

Let's explore each of these funds in more detail below. Schwab's small-cap ETF tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Small-Cap Total Stock Market Index. The fund provides easy, diversified access to the small-cap segment of the U.S. stock market. In 2025, smaller companies stand to benefit from falling interest rates and, possibly, deregulation and lower corporate tax rates courtesy of a new presidential administration. These conditions encourage growth and expansion, which are primary goals for small companies. Larger companies may not see the same boost. Big corporations often have higher concentrations of fixed-rate debt, which doesn't reprice to lower market rates until refinanced. As well, large-caps with international revenue sources will see a lesser impact from tax cuts. As well, large-caps are plagued by high valuations right now, which contributes to volatility. The current price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of the S&P 500 is 31. The SCHA portfolio compares favorably on this metric, with a PE ratio of 18. SSGA's mid-cap fund tracks the S&P 400 Mid Cap Index. Holdings include Williams Sonoma (WSM), DocuSign (DOCU) and Burlington Stores (BURL). Mid-sized companies should see the same tailwinds as small caps in 2025—but with the potential for better results. Mid-caps are more established, mature and profitable than small caps. They also have better access to capital, which makes them more resilient. Resilience could play a role if the economic and policy tailwinds don't materialize as expected. If the Fed takes its time lowering interest rates, for example, mid-caps could outperform small-caps and large-caps next year. SPMD's PE ratio is 18.7, slightly higher than the Schwab small-cap fund. iShares Core S&P Total U.S. Stock Market ETF tracks the S&P Total Market Index. The index intends to represent all segments of the stock market, from microcaps to megacaps. If you don't want to bet on one market segment, this fund covers all bases. The portfolio includes companies of all sizes and from all economic sectors. For better or worse, ITOT will deliver market-level returns, minus a few basis points for fund expenses. Note that the ITOT portfolio is weighted by market capitalization, so the biggest companies are held in the largest proportions. Concentration risk is a concern—the “Magnificent 7” megacap stocks will have undue influence over the entire group's performance.

The index and the fund are sector-diversified with larger holdings in financials, industrials and healthcare. As we close out 2024, growth stock valuations are running high. This trend could continue, stretching stock prices even higher relative to earnings. Or, it could reverse in a pullback. Either way, the conditions look good for value stocks to shine as a counterpoint. Investors may add value stock exposure to offset the rising risk of high valuations in growth, or in response to a reset. VTV is an easy option to secure that exposure. The fund holds premier value stock names, including Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) and Procter & Gamble (PG), plus the AI stock Broadcom (AVGO). Invesco's high dividend low volatility fund tracks an index that includes 50 dividend-paying S&P 500 stocks. The holdings are primarily large-caps with value characteristics. SPHD is popular among income investors. To learn more, see how to build an ETF portfolio for income and best ETFs for income investing. While investors are cautiously optimistic about the U.S. economy and the Republican agenda, there is an undercurrent of uncertainty. Certain policy changes, such as new tariffs, could invite inflation. Lingering inflation, in turn, would slow the pace of the Fed's interest rate cuts. When investor uncertainty is combined with high valuations and over-concentration in the S&P 500, volatility can result. The high income and low volatility characteristics of SPHD's portfolio could provide some shelter if the market turns into a rollercoaster in 2025. Vanguard's VGLT fund holds Treasury bonds with maturities ranging from 10 to 25 years. As of December 2024, the average coupon rate is 3.2% and the yield to maturity is 4.5%. Long-term bonds are reactive to market interest rate changes because they don't reprice as quickly as short-term bonds. The pricing response goes in the opposite direction of interest rates. Given the prevailing opinion that rates will decline in 2025, today's long-term bonds may carry above-market rates sometime next year. That will drive their value on the secondary market higher. VGLT provides that long-term bond exposure. The fund is a suitable diversification option within or outside a Vanguard retirement investing portfolio. As an ETF investor, there are times when you want protection from certain elements of the market. Factors to watch currently include high valuations and the excessive influence of megacaps. Diversifying your ETF portfolio with small cap, midcap and value stock exposure may provide the protection you need in the year ahead. Total U.S. stock market ETFs with low expense ratios are suitable for beginners in 2025. These provide exposure to all U.S. economic sectors, small to large companies and a blend of growth and value characteristics. To choose an ETF, first decide what type of assets you need—as in stocks, bonds or a combination. Then, review funds that align with your needs and select one with a low expense ratio, low tracking error, long history of performance and good trading volume. ETFs are not necessarily better than stocks. ETFs can be more appropriate for novice investors than individual stocks because ETFs are diversified. The most tax-efficient ETFs are those that pay no dividends or interest. Many ETFs will make capital gains distributions annually, which are taxable. You can defer the tax liability of ETF income and gains by holding the funds in a tax-advantaged account. Yes, you can lose money with ETFs. You can mitigate the risk of loss somewhat by choosing diversified funds and holding them for years or decades, rather than months.

Nvidia (NVDA+2.41%) stock climbed during Wednesday morning trading after slumping into correction territory earlier in the week. The chipmaker’s shares were up by about 3.5% before noon Wednesday after falling into a correction at market close Monday. Nvidia’s shares continued falling by almost 3% Tuesday. The company’s shares are up by 180% so far this year. Meanwhile, rival chip designer Broadcom (AVGO+5.10%) closed up more than 11% Monday after it soared 20% Friday to surpass the $1 trillion market cap for the first time. The chipmaker reported a 220% jump in artificial intelligence revenue for the fourth quarter ended in November. On the company’s earnings call, Broadcom chief executive Hock Tan said it sees “our opportunity over the next three years in AI as massive.” Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon wrote that Broadcom was having an “Nvidia moment” in a Monday note, reported by MarketWatch. Rasgon noted “a likely sharp new product ramp into [the second half of] 2025, and outlook for material opportunity … a few years out.” However, Broadcom’s stock fell by more than 5% Tuesday, and its shares were down by more than 3% during Wednesday morning trading. The chipmaker’s shares are up by almost 103% so far this year. Meanwhile, Microsoft (MSFT-0.56%) reportedly bought twice as many of Nvidia’s Hopper chips as its rivals this year. The tech giant is estimated to have bought 485,000 of the chips — more than double Nvidia’s second-largest U.S. customer, Meta (META+1.89%), which bought 224,000, the Financial Times reported, citing analysts at technology consultancy Omdia. The analysts estimate Amazon (AMZN+0.50%) bought 196,000 Hopper chips, and Google (GOOGL+1.27%) bought 169,000.

This is not investment advice. The author has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. Wccftech.com has a disclosure and ethics policy. NVIDIA has reigned uncontested over the AI chip sphere for far too long. However, now it seems that some much-needed competition is finally putting up a challenge to the GPU manufacturer's full-spectrum dominance over this critical arena. OMDIA: $GOOGL'S TPU DEMAND GROWS, CHALLENGING $NVDA'S AI CHIP DOMINANCE Omdia research shows surging demand for Google's TPU chips, with estimates suggesting they could account for $6B–$9B in Broadcom's AI semiconductor revenue this year. At even $6B, TPU shipments are growing… — Wall St Engine (@wallstengine) December 18, 2024 To wit, Omdia Research has now published its fresh take on the dynamics within the AI chip sphere, noting that Goggle's Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) could account for between $6 billion and $9 billion in AI-related sales for Broadcom this year. As a refresher, Broadcom is currently developing custom AI chips (ASICs) for three major customers: Google, Meta, and ByteDance. The company is also developing next-gen AIXPUs with two other clients. For the benefit of those who might not be aware, many cloud providers have begun preferring custom chips or ASICs over NVIDIA's GPUs due to the former's cost advantage over the latter, which enables cost-effective optimization of internal workloads. As per Morgan Stanley's estimates, the custom AI chip market - driven primarily by cloud providers - will grow from $120 billion in 2024 to $300 billion by 2027, outpacing the growth rate for the GPU market. Coming back, Omdia believes that even if Broadcom's TPU shipments for 2024 ultimately clock-in at $6 billion, which constitutes the low-end of the research firm's estimated range, they would still be significant enough to dent NVIDIA's AI chip market share! Looking ahead, Omdia continues to see TPU-powered AI products driving broad-based growth for Google Cloud. $NVDA +2.75% [Microsoft bought twice as many of Nvidia’s flagship chips as any of its largest rivals in the U.S. and China this year, per FT. Analysts at Omdia, a technology consultancy, estimate that $MSFT bought 485K of Nvidia’s “Hopper” chips this year. That put Microsoft far… — NOTRELOAD AI (@thudderwicks) December 18, 2024 Of course, this does not mean that NVIDIA is about to cede its market dominance anytime soon. As an illustration, Omdia notes elsewhere that Microsoft bought a whopping 485,000 units of NVIDIA's Hopper GPUs in 2024, while Meta bought another 224,000 units of these last-gen chips. Meanwhile, NVIDIA continues to prepare the ground for its next-gen Blackwell GPUs to take volume leadership from the older Hopper chips. Citi on $NVDA (Buy; PT $175): 'Recent custom ASIC chipmakers’ $MRVL and $AVGO strong results are stirring up new investor questions on the old 'GPU vs Custom ASIC' debate. As highlighted in our recent report, we expect both to coexist with the software reprogrammability to… — Wall St Engine (@wallstengine) December 18, 2024 Meanwhile, Citi expects the AI chip sphere to grow to a TAM of $380 billion by 2028, where AI GPUs (read NVIDIA) control 75 percent of the market while ASICs account for the residual 25 percent.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia stock (NVDA) is on pace for a comfortable triple-digit percentage gain again in 2024, after a nearly 240% surge in 2023. This year's rise is due in no small part to a product that wasn’t even shipped until the last quarter of the year — Blackwell. It’s the largest GPU (graphics processing unit) ever built, created by connecting two dies via a high bandwidth interface (HBI). In layperson’s terms, that translates to a lot of power at high efficiency, which is why it's been in such demand from the so-called hyperscalers — companies like Alphabet (GOOG) and Microsoft (MSFT) that are building out huge data centers to power large language models (LLMs). That hot demand for Blackwell and the 170% surge in Nvidia shares is what led Yahoo Finance to name the chip its 2024 Product of the Year.

Data centers that power generative AI or LLMs are currently occupied with inputting data and training those models. Blackwell and its predecessor, Hopper, are well-suited for that work. Blackwell represents an enormous advancement in power. It contains 208 billion transistors, more than two and a half times the number in Hopper. Its GB200 NVL72 server, which combines 72 Blackwell GPUs with 36 Grace CPUs, clocks up to a 30x performance increase compared to the same number of Hopper GPUs for LLM inference workloads. It also uses up to 25x less energy. “For us to leapfrog ourselves by an order of magnitude is pretty unheard of,” Dion Harris, director of accelerated data center, HPC (high-performance computing), and AI at Nvidia, said in a phone interview. “We were limited by physics, but we recognized that innovation with the HBI would allow us to extend the die-level communication and compute.” US business spending on generative AI has sextupled in a year, going from $2.3 billion in 2023 to $13.8 billion in 2024, according to Menlo Ventures. And the trend is only going up, as major companies from banking and retail to tech and hospitality race to introduce advanced chatbots and assistants to their customers. Nvidia's clients are paying dearly for their chips. The company doesn't break out Blackwell sales specifically, but KeyBanc analyst John Vinh estimates that Blackwell will account for $4 billion to $5 billion in sales in the current quarter. "After Q4, we should start to see a pretty quick ramp," he said in a phone interview. "For next year, we’re modeling $187 billion in compute data center revenues, of which 80% of that should be Blackwell." "Having such dominant market share, they have pricing power," he added. "As a hyperscaler, you pretty much have to pay Nvidia whatever they want." Nvidia’s rivals such as AMD (AMD) and even Amazon (AMZN) are working hard to develop their own alternatives. How long the GPU giant’s AI chip dominance can last has been up for debate ever since its shocking upside revenue beat in May 2023. Those questions have gotten louder as of late. Its shares have pulled back 12% from their record close on Nov. 7. And since the beginning of December, other semiconductor news has been getting buzz, including Amazon’s Trainium2 and Nova semiconductors. Broadcom (AVGO) has been gaining steam following its earnings report, catapulting its market cap to over $1 trillion. The crux of the excitement is the company's contract AI chip business, which CEO Hock Tan said would reach a "total serviceable market" of $60 billion to $90 billion by 2027. That said, "No one has been able to come out with a successful custom solution" that matches Nvidia's, Vinh said. Because Nvidia's earnings have been growing at a rapid clip alongside its share price, its valuation has remained competitive with other chipmakers. Its forward price-to-earnings ratio, for example, stands at nearly 31, compared to 25 for AMD and 46 for Broadcom, according to Yahoo Finance data. Companies like Amazon remain Nvidia customers even as they develop competing products. Nvidia dominates the market for training generative AI models — accounting for roughly 85% share — “and they’re not losing,” said Ben Bajarin, CEO of Creative Strategies. But once that training is complete, the models will turn to inference — putting all that information they’ve digested and learned to work. The power needed for inference is generally lower than that of training, though Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has consistently maintained that his company’s chips are well-suited to that stage as well. One factor in whether customers will continue to buy is cost. In addition to being the most advanced chips, Nvidia’s are also the most expensive. The company touts its TCO, or total cost of ownership, emphasizing computing power relative to energy usage over the life of the chips. “I doubt they’ll have the same market share they have today in inference,” Bajarin said. “There will be much more competition for inference.” Thus far, however, Nvidia’s biggest point of friction has been its own supply chain. A chip of Blackwell’s complexity and power has hit manufacturing and design snags, as Huang has acknowledged. After delays, the chip is expected to ship this Q4 and ramp up production next year. “Blackwell production is in full steam,” Huang said in the company's latest earnings call. “I think we're in great shape with respect to the Blackwell ramp at this point.” Still, the company said demand will exceed supply for several quarters. Nvidia's pace of overall sales growth is predicted to slow over the next year, a factor of the "law of large numbers," Jordan Klein, analyst at Mizuho Group, said in an email. Nvidia's sales rose by 126% in calendar 2023 over the prior year. They'll rise by 111% this year, according to analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, and 52% next year. "Nothing to worry about really, demand still exceeds supply," Klein said.
