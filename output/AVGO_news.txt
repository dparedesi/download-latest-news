The Magnificent Seven had a strong May, but the group remains in the red for 2025. What's next? Taken together, the seven big tech stocks—names like Nvidia (NVDA), Tesla (TSLA), Meta Platforms (META) and more—outperformed dozens of other assets tracked by Deutsche Bank analyst Henry Allen last month. The group saw their stocks rise more than 13% in aggregate in May, their biggest monthly gain in 2 years, according to Allen. Nonetheless, the group remains one of the few corners of global markets lower since the start of the year. Of 32 different sets of investments tracked by Allen—including global equity indexes, government and corporate bonds, foreign exchange indexes, and commodities—only one other asset, crude oil, is negative for the year. Whether the Mag Seven can climb into positive territory this month could depend on what Wall Street thinks of a few upcoming corporate events. Apple (AAPL) will host its Worldwide Developers Conference on June 9. The iPhone maker is expected to unveil a software development kit that helps outside developers build features with Apple Intelligence’s underlying large language models. That would effectively let Apple outsource some of the work of building AI products for its devices, which could help close the perceived gap in AI capabilities between it and major peers. And around the middle of the month, Tesla (TSLA) is expected to roll out its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, in what could be a major test of the company’s autonomous vehicle ambitions. Apple and Tesla are the worst-performing stocks in the Mag Seven so far this year, with their shares down about 20% and 16%, respectively. Investor enthusiasm about the companies' progress in some emerging areas seen as vital could help lift their shares. Bank of America analysts on Monday upgraded the information technology sector—home to Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia, and Broadcom (AVGO), the latter a non-Magnificent stock—to neutral from underweight, and downgraded communications services—including Alphabet (GOOG) and Meta—to underweight from neutral. They cited active funds’ historically low exposure to IT and high exposure to communications, as well as the communications and media industry’s comparatively unpredictable revenue streams. Perceived recession risks have decreased in the last month thanks to easing tensions between the U.S. and China. Lately, though each side has accused the other in recent days of violating the terms of their agreement, demonstrating the fragility of their detente. The Mag Seven’s communications companies, Alphabet and Meta, likely have the most recession-proof ad businesses on the internet thanks to the sheer size of their audiences. Yet the tech giants face another risk, according to BofA analysts: Tech companies, they say, addressed elevated interest rates in 2023 by effectively “shortening duration”—they cut costs, reduced capital expenditures, and increased their cash returns. Today, Alphabet and Meta are locked in an all-out AI arms race, spending tens of billions of dollars a year on AI infrastructure. That spending could tie the companies’ hands in the event of a slowdown. Another risk for tech stocks is their price tag, according to BofA. Valuations have declined from their recent highs, but the stocks are still expensive—the Mag Seven's P/E ratio of 33.1 is well above the S&P 500's long-term average—and earnings expectations remain elevated.

Title: Nvidia, Other Chip Stocks Slide Amid Worries About US-China Trade Tensions

Nvidia (NVDA) and other semiconductor stocks slid Friday amid worries about worsening U.S.-China trade tensions. Shares of Nvidia were down nearly 4% in recent trading. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), Broadcom (AVGO), Micron Technology (MU), and Applied Materials (AMAT) also lost ground, with the PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX) dropping about 3%. Some of Nvidia's partners, including server maker Super Micro Computer (SMCI), saw their stocks fall as well. (Read Investopedia's full coverage of today's trading here.) President Trump on Friday said China has "totally violated its agreement with us," dampening hopes the countries would soon come to a longer-term agreement after reaching a temporary truce earlier this month. Separately, Bloomberg reported Friday that Trump plans to expand U.S. companies' licensing requirements to make deals with Chinese companies that have ties to sanctioned firms. The development comes after the Trump administration moved earlier this month to rescind the Biden-era AI diffusion rule that would have further curbed sales of American AI hardware to a broader group of countries, but warned it's looking to replace the rule with new restrictions. Analysts at Citi and Deutsche Bank warned at the time that they could turn out to be stricter than Biden's. During Nvidia's earnings call on Wednesday, CEO Jensen Huang said it's "terrific" that Trump rescinded the Biden-era rule, but criticized the administration's other moves to limit its sales to China, saying that "shielding Chinese chipmakers from U.S. competition only strengthens them abroad and weakens America's position." The AI chipmaker took a $4.5 billion charge in its fiscal first quarter associated with new export curbs on the company's H20 chips to China, and said it expects to take an $8 billion hit in the current quarter due to lost revenue.
