Title: AI Stocks Got Some Good News—And Surged. Will This Micron-Powered Momentum Last?
URL: https://www.investopedia.com/ai-stocks-got-some-good-news-and-surged-will-this-micron-powered-momentum-last-mu-11872216
Time Published: 2025-12-18T21:19:51Z
Full Content:
AI stocks soared Thursday after memory chip maker Micron (MU) reported quarterly results far stronger-than-expected. That offered tech investors a glimmer of hope after weeks of disappointing performance for AI stocks. Micron was the S&P 500's best-performing stock Thursday, with shares finishing up more than 10%. Fellow memory and storage companies Sandisk (SNDK) and Western Digital (WDC) saw similar jumps, rising 6% and 5%, respectively. Other AI beneficiaries, such as nuclear power provider Constellation Energy (CEG) and software company Applovin (APP), whose stocks have lately been pressured, were also sharply higher. Micron's results were a big tailwind Thursday. The company blew past quarterly earnings estimates, citing booming demand from data centers for its memory chips and a supply shortage. Demand is so strong, according to executives on the company’s earnings call, that Micron is already sold out of high-bandwidth memory chips through 2026. The AI rally that's fueled the bull market for three years hit turbulence last month and has remained under pressure. Micron's strong earnings could revive Wall Street's confidence in the AI infrastructure buildout and, subsequently, the companies and stocks benefiting from it. “Yesterday’s guidance was everything [Micron] bulls could have hoped for,” said Ryan Lee, senior vice president of product and strategy at Direxion, in emailed comments. Micron predicted earnings per share of $8.19 in the current quarter, more than 70% above Wall Street’s expectations. The critical challenge for the company will be increasing supply without eating into margins, according to Lee. There were also notes of restraint. The semiconductor industry is notoriously cyclical, alternating between periods of severe undersupply and oversupply. "Investors should be valuing memory names on through-cycle profitability potential, not on current peak levels," wrote Deutsche Bank analyst Melissa Weathers in a note on Thursday. Still, Weathers hailed Micron's results as evidence of "a paradigm shift in the memory sector." The industry, she wrote, "is structurally low on supply, which could sustain for multiple years to come." The question on some investors’ minds Thursday is whether Micron’s results would be enough to revive the ailing AI rally. In early November, investors grew anxious about when big tech would see returns on its massive investments in artificial intelligence, if at all. Investors also grew wary of the industry's increasing reliance on debt to fund its projects. Those concerns dampened the mood on Wall Street, causing high-flying tech stocks to pull back from their records. Investors are increasingly demanding evidence that AI investments are delivering tangible benefits or will soon. Oracle (ORCL) tumbled last week after its results failed to temper anxiety about its debt-financed data center investments. Chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO) showed its AI business was booming, but investors focused on the impact that growth might have on its profit margins. That's likely why Micron's results reinvigorated investors today. "Memory and storage vendors are demand weathervanes for AI, so seeing demand so vastly exceed supply is a positive sign for the industry as a whole," Olivier Blanchard, research director and practice lead of intelligent devices at The Futurum Group, told Investopedia. Paul Meeks, managing director and head of technology research at Freedom Capital Markets, believes the AI infrastructure boom has “at least another year, likely two” in it. That’s why he sees potential for Micron’s earnings to exceed already high expectations, and says “any dip presents an extraordinary opportunity” to buy the stock and other companies benefiting from AI spending. Morgan Stanley analysts said memory companies like Micron, Western Digital, and Seagate Technology (STX) “would be the biggest beneficiary” if tech companies and investors continue to plow money into AI infrastructure. "Memory and storage for AI are finally having their moment," Blanchard said.

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Drew Angerer/ Getty Images News via Getty Images Shares of Micron (NASDAQ: MU) are up about 14%, or by $31 this morning. All thanks to strong earnings. EPS of $4.78 beat by 82 cents. Revenue of $13.64 billion beat by $760 million. Moving forward, the company expects to earn between $8.22 and $8.62 per share, with revenue expected to be between $18.3 billion and $19.1 billion for the second quarter. Analysts were looking for $4.78 per share on revenue of $14.3 billion. “Our Q2 outlook reflects substantial records across revenue, gross margin, EPS, and free cash flow, and we anticipate our business performance to continue strengthening through fiscal 2026,” added Sanjay Mehrotra, Chairman, President, and CEO of Micron, as quoted in an earnings release. Fueling further upside, Micron says supply-demand issues could create a $100 billion high-bandwidth memory (HBM) market by 2028 – a milestone projected to arrive two years before the company’s previous outlook. Micron also declared a dividend of $0.115 per share, which is payable on January 14 to shareholders of record as of December 29. Shares of Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) took a massive hit after management warned of margin pressures. However, as I noted the other day, analysts at Morgan Stanley still expect AVGO to see strong growth moving forward. With an overweight rating on AVGO, Morgan Stanley has a $462 price target on AVGO. They also believe the latest pullback is an overreaction. Analysts at Bank of America have a $500 price target with a buy rating. Goldman Sachs has a $450 price target with a buy rating. UBS has a $472 price target with a buy rating. And Bernstein has a $475 price target with an outperform rating. This morning, AVGO is gaining lost ground after UBS added that it’s time to buy the dip. Technically, AVGO is severely oversold at $326.02. It’s also overextended on RSI, MACD, and Williams’ %R. From its last traded price of $326.02, we’d like to see it rally back to $400. Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) are up about 3%, or by $6 a share, in premarket. Analysts at Piper Sandler have an overweight rating on the stock with a price target of $280 a share. The analysts are bullish on the stock ahead of its Helios launch. Helios is a new, open, rack-scale AI platform designed for AI training and inference. Technically, AMD is also oversold on RSI, MACD, and Williams’ %R. From its last traded price of $198.11, we’d like to see the tech giant soar back to $270 initially. Recent AMD earnings have also been solid. EPS OF $1.20 beat by three cents. Revenue of $9.25 billion, up 35.6% year over year, beat by $500 million. Moving forward, AMD expects fourth-quarter sales to be between $9.3 billion and $9.9 billion, with the mid-point of $9.6 billion above the $9.21 billion estimate. “Our record third quarter performance and strong fourth quarter guidance marks a clear step up in our growth trajectory as our expanding compute franchise and rapidly scaling data center AI business drive significant revenue and earnings growth,” said Dr. Lisa Su, AMD chair and CEO, as quoted in an earnings release.
