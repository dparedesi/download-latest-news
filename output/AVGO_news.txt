Broadcom (AVGO) shares surged in extended trading Thursday after the chipmaker reported better-than-expected earnings and issued a rosy outlook amid robust AI-driven sales growth. The company said its fiscal 2024 AI revenue more than tripled, driven by its AI XPUs and Ethernet networking portfolio. After-hours gains accelerated after CEO Hock Tan told analysts on the company’s earnings call that he anticipates significant AI opportunities over the next three years, adding that he sees accelerators and networking sales in fiscal 2027 ranging between $60 billion and $90 billion. Through Thursday's close, Broadcom shares had gained 64% since the start of the year. The stock rose 14% to around $206 in extended trading. Below, we break down the technicals on Broadcom’s weekly chart and identify key price levels worth watching out for. Broadcom shares have consolidated within an ascending triangle since mid June, a chart pattern that signals a continuation of the stock’s longer-term uptrend. Indeed, the price sits poised to break out above the formation’s top trendline on Friday, setting the stage for further upside. Moreover, the relative strength index (RSI) gives a reading just above 50, confirming bullish momentum and indicating the shares have ample room to test higher prices as they move into price discovery. Let’s apply technical analysis to forecast a potential upside price target and also identify two key support levels that would likely attract buying interest during retracements. To forecast an upside target in the stock, investors can use the bars pattern tool, which analyzes prior trends to help predict future directional moves. When applying the tool to Broadcom's chart, we extract the stock’s trend higher from December 2023 to June this year and reposition it from the ascending triangle’s top trendline. This projects a longer-term upside target of around $315. We selected this prior move as it commenced following a decisive earnings-driven jump above a continuation pattern on the chart in December last year, similar price action to what looks likely after the company’s latest quarterly report. During pullbacks, investors should initially watch how the price reacts to the $185 level. This location on the chart would likely attract buying interest near the ascending triangle’s top trendline, which may flip from an area of prior resistance into future support. Selling below this level could see Broadcom shares revisit lower support around $140, an area where investors may seek buying opportunities near a horizontal line that connects a series of comparable trading activity on the chart between February and September.

It follows Apple’s release on Wednesday of its latest updates to iOS, macOS, and other devices featuring new Apple Intelligence capabilities. Apple and Broadcom did not immediately respond to Decrypt’s request for comments. Apple is collaborating with Broadcom on the chip’s networking features, according to a report by The Information on Wednesday, citing sources with “direct knowledge of the project.” Code-named Baltra, the AI-focused chip is expected to enter production in 2026. Experts suggest that Apple’s collaboration with Broadcom aims to bring the server needs for its growing Apple Intelligence initiatives closer to home. “Those capabilities can actually be processed on the phone, the iPad, the Mac, independently, but in some cases, they need to go to the cloud, things like writing tools, things like summarizing text, in some cases, summarizing articles,” Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman told Bloomberg TV. “And for that, you need your own server infrastructure.” Founded in 1991, San Jose-based Broadcom develops semiconductor and software technologies. Its products are used in data centers, networking, and wireless communication, supporting various modern tech applications. This new collaboration is the latest in a partnership between Apple and Broadcom that began in 2023 with a multi-year deal for the chip manufacturer to develop 5G radio frequency components for Apple products. The new AI chip aims to meet the significant computing demands of Apple’s enhanced AI features while improving performance and energy efficiency. Apple’s Israel-based silicon design team will spearhead the development of the chip. Earlier this month, Apple acknowledged that its current AI-related computer chips are made through partnerships with Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services to support its search and Apple Intelligence programs. Others working with Apple to develop the new AI chip include Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, which will be responsible for mass-producing the chip. Apple’s AAPL stock rose briefly on Wednesday following the announcement of the partnership with Broadcom to $250 before falling to $247. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s AVGO stock rose 7.5% to $184.73 before slipping to $182.98 in after-hours trading.

Title: Bitcoin Crosses Above $101K as XRP, AI Tokens Lead Crypto Rally Following CPI

The crypto market is in recovery mode on Wednesday following a cascade of selling earlier in the week that for now appears to have flushed out much of the long leverage. The move higher comes alongside a sizable rally in the U.S. stock market following this morning's Consumer Price Index report that matched economist forecasts. The news was enough to convince traders that the Federal Reserve is certain to trim its benchmark fed funds rate another 25 basis points at its meeting next week. The Nasdaq is ahead 1.5% and the S&P 500 just shy of 1%. After having fallen to as low as $94,100 at one point earlier this week, bitcoin (BTC) has recovered to $101,000, up more than 6% over the past 24 hours. The broader CoinDesk 20 Index is ahead nearly 11% over that same time frame, led by XRP's 15% advance.

Title: Broadcom’s (AVGO) AI Growth: Why JP Morgan is Bullish on Its Future

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 AI News That Broke The Internet. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stands against the other AI stocks. Should original content contributors be paid every time large language models use their work? OpenAI CEO Sam Altman believes they should, much like Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) deals for college athletes, he said on Wednesday at the New York Times’ DealBook Summit. “I think we do need a new [standard] for how creators are going to get rewarded. We need to find new economic models where creators can have new revenue streams”. READ ALSO: 10 Buzzing AI Stocks Making Headlines and Top 10 AI News Stories For The Weekend Even though developing such an economic model will be complex, it is unclear how people getting paid for their original work could become a norm in the future even if it does. The news comes amidst ChatGPT, Altman’s AI chatbot, which has itself been under fire numerous times over the years over copyright infringement and unpermitted use of published articles. “A particular passion of mine has always been, can we figure out how to do micropayments where, if you generate a story in the style of [a writer, they] can opt into that ... and get paid for it.” Regardless of Altman’s company facing criticism over copyright infringement concerns and ethical debates surrounding its AI models, the company continues to push boundaries in AI innovation, introducing groundbreaking tools and features that redefine the tech landscape. In its latest, OpenAI has introduced its buzzy AI video-generation tool, Sora, on Monday, December 9th. Working similar to OpenAI’s image-generation AI tool, DALL-E, Sora will be able to develop a high-definition video clip each time a user types out a desired scene. The video generation tool will also be able to generate video clips inspired by still images and extend existing videos or fill in missing frames. As per OpenAI’s YouTube live stream, the tool will debut to U.S. users as well as to “most countries internationally” on Monday, December 9th. However, it also said that there is “no timeline” yet for launching the tool in Europe and the U.K., as well as some other countries. In October, the company closed its latest funding round with a valuation of $157 billion, securing $6.6 billion from a wide range of investment firms and major tech companies. All of the company’s strategic initiatives and funding are part of a thoughtful growth plan for OpenAI as the company competes with other strong AI startups such as Anthropic, Elon Musk’s xAI, and other tech giants. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A technician working at a magnified microscope, developing a new integrated circuit. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 128 Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), a technology company, offers custom chip offerings and networking assets that has helped it establish a strong position in the AI space. On December 9, JP Morgan analyst Harlan Sur maintained an Overweight rating on Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) with a price target of $210. With the technology company set to report its earnings on Thursday, the firm remains bullish on the stock on the back of a strong demand profile for AI products, continued cyclical recovery in its diversified semiconductor (ex-AI) end markets, and unlocked VMWare revenue synergy. Sur affirmed that software renewals from major corporate customers will lead to strong growth in the VMWare business, a cloud computing technology company that Broadcom acquired in November 2023. Overall, the analyst projects revenue and EPS upside for the full year, continued strong demand for AI products, and a coordinated end market recovery in its diversified semiconductor (ex-AI) end markets for fiscal year 2025. With a $30 billion pipeline of AI revenue opportunities per AI customer over the next 4-5 years, and strong VMWare momentum, Sur projects strong dividend growth and sustained AI leadership for the company. “Broadcom is set to report October quarter (F4Q24) earnings Thursday, and we continued to see a strong demand profile for its AI products combined with continued cyclical recovery in its diversified semiconductor (ex-AI) end markets (e.g., enterprise, server/storage) and VMWare revenue synergy unlock.” Overall, AVGO ranks 1st on our list of AI news that broke the internet. While we acknowledge the potential of AVGO as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AVGO but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.
