Investing Stocks that plunged on the open on the Federal Reserve subpoena news reversed sharply and ended higher across the board by the close. Fourth-quarter earnings will kick off with the big Wall Street banks reporting this week With some spicy economic news on tap, like today’s December Consumer Price Index print, which is expected to be 2.7% year-over-year, it could move markets. Sending You to Google News in 3 © Chaay_Tee / iStock via Getty Images The futures are trending higher after the December consumer price index came in at 2.7%, which matched Wall Street expectations. The reversal in the futures comes after a wild Monday that saw stocks get hammered on the open, amid news of Department of Justice subpoenas sent to Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell regarding his testimony to Congress last summer. Initially, all the major indices plunged on the news, then reversed sharply to finish higher on the day. Both the Dow Jones Industrials, which closed up 0.17% at 49,590, and the S&P 500, which ended the day higher by 0.16% at 6,977, once again printed new all-time highs as the January strength continues. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was last seen at 23,833, up 0.25%, and the Russel 2000 continued its red-hot start to the year, closing at 2,635, up 0.44%. The R2K is leading all the major indices in 2026, up 5.7% on the year. Wall Street is now looking forward to the start of the fourth-quarter earnings, with the big money-center banks reporting later this week. Yields were higher across the entire Treasury curve on Monday, and you can bet that the controversy with the Federal Reserve receiving subpoenas was a big reason for the selling. The uncertainty about Fed independence and the potential for government intervention pushed bond prices down, echoing past “Sell America” events in 2025. The reality is this will likely blow over quickly, as a mountain of economic news and the start of earnings season will redirect attention. The 30-year bond closed at 4.84%, while the benchmark 10-year note was last seen at 4.19%. Prices were higher across the energy complex on Monday as geopolitical tensions in multiple regions around the globe and the potential for long-term changes to the global oil supply drove crude oil prices higher, with the WTI and Brent benchmarks both climbing. Brent Crude closed trading on Monday at $64.01, up 1.06%, while West Texas Intermediate finished the session at $59.63, up 0.85%. Natural gas stormed back after a wave of frigid weather swept across a large swath of the U.S. Monday, closing up 6.5% at $3.38. In what seems like a never-ending story, Gold closed Monday at $4,596, up another 1.94%. Wall Street’s $5,000 price targets for the precious metal could arrive much sooner than expected. The combination of numerous geopolitical hotspots and Federal Reserve news once again provided the stiff tailwind that has been present for well over a year. Silver also bolted higher on Monday, climbing a massive 6.6% to close trading at $85.14. Wall Street’s $100 price targets are getting closer by the week, and with most rebalancing finished, the path for Silver looks higher. The crypto market traded range-bound and sideways on Monday, influenced by a “risk-off” environment, much like other asset classes, driven by rising geopolitical tensions and uncertainty over U.S. monetary policy, including the escalating dispute between the Trump administration and Federal Reserve Chair Powell. At 8A EST, Bitcoin was quoted at $92,010, while Ethereum was posted at $3, 131. 24/7 Wall St. reviews dozens of analyst research reports daily to identify new investment ideas for both investors and traders.
