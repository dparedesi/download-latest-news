We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Financial Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) stands against the other best financial stocks to buy according to hedge funds. According to the Business Research Company, the market for financial services has expanded significantly in the last several years and is further expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 7.7% in the next few years. The year 2024 was remarkable for the financial sector, as seen by the Financial Sector Index, which rose over 30% as of mid-December and outperformed the broader market by almost 5 percentage points. This expansion came after worries over mid-sized bank failures in early 2024, which turned out to be isolated events rather than a problem affecting the entire industry. As of January 7, 2025, the market’s financial sector produced returns of 5.51% over three years, 9.68% over five years, and 9.49% over ten years. These numbers, however, pale in comparison to the sector’s remarkable success during the previous 12 months, which saw a return of 28.01%. Looking forward, according to Fidelity’s report, the financial industry’s prospects for 2025 seem promising, backed by consistent economic expansion in the United States. It is projected that the Federal Reserve’s move to rate decreases in the second half of 2024 will boost confidence and lower credit risk. Falling rates have the potential to boost lending and deposit growth while also reducing net interest margins. As per Fidelity analyst Matt Reed: “Lower rates boost economic momentum, benefiting banks and payment processors alike.” Banks that are well-diversified and have solid fundamentals are better equipped to handle a soft landing situation. Sensitive to consumer spending, payment processors are likewise poised for expansion as more accommodating monetary policy and strong consumer activity coincide. Risks still exist, though. As per the aforementioned report, if the economy weakens, some lenders may face difficulties due to their exposure to commercial real estate and possible nonperforming loans. Nonetheless, financials start 2025 with significant momentum due to a less stringent regulatory agenda following the election and more prospects for mergers and acquisitions. Michael Kantrowitz, chief investment strategist at Piper Sandler stated: “I think investors have rotated a little bit out of some of the big tech companies and into the big financial companies,” He claimed that while a lot of optimism about artificial intelligence (AI) is priced into tech businesses, some investor movement made sense since the rate environment has improved for bank earnings. Deloitte’s 2025 banking and capital markets outlook report states that banks can strengthen their basis for sustainable growth with creativity and discipline as the banking industry adjusts to a low-growth, lower-rate environment. According to the report, the baseline scenario for economic growth in 2025 is projected to fall to 1.5%, with possible deviations between 1.0% and 1.9% due to slowing consumer spending, greater unemployment, and sluggish business investment. By Q2 of 2024, consumer debt had risen to $17.7 trillion, and by March 2024, savings from the pandemic had been spent, further straining the economy. Inflation is forecast to be around 2%, allowing for three to four rate cuts, bringing the federal funds rate down to 350-375 basis points. Treasury yields are projected to fall, and following two years of inversion, the yield curve may normalize. With the exception of economies that are under pressure, global central banks will likely choose to cut benchmark rates.
