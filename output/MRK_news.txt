Investing A change at the top of the Federal Reserve could pave the way for more rate cuts in 2026. After three rate cuts in 2025, investors could see two more in 2026. Quality high-yield companies like the Small Dogs of the Dow could rule in 2026. Sending You to Google News in 3 © marekuliasz / iStock via Getty Images The Dogs of the Dow is a well-known strategy first published in 1991 by Michael O’Higgins. The plan aims to maximize investment returns by purchasing the 10 highest-yielding dividend stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average each year. The highest-yielding stocks are also the lowest-priced stocks in the venerable average, as the lower a stock (or bond) is priced, the higher the attached yield or coupon becomes. Since the turn of the century, the Dogs of the Dow have outperformed the overall Dow, and the Small Dogs of the Dow, which are the five highest-yielding stocks, even more so. The fact that investors are buying the highest-yielding companies in the venerable index improves the chances for total return gains. From 2000 through the early 2020s, the Dogs strategy posted strong average annual returns, generally beating the Dow by a few percentage points over the entire period. The plan is not foolproof; it struggled during the dot-com bust (early 2000s) and the tech-driven growth surge post-pandemic (2020 to 2021), when growth stocks soared, and value stocks lagged. They also lagged in 2025 as the AI-driven rally continued for the third straight year. The Dogs often shine in tough markets (like 2008 or 2022), protecting investor capital much better than the broader market by holding stable, high-yielding blue-chip companies. This makes them an excellent choice for Baby Boomers seeking safety and passive income. While the AI/data center rally has pushed stocks and indices to all-time highs, and it could still be a force in 2026, the reality is that the stock market, as measured by the S&P 500, is expensive. It trades at 31 times trailing earnings and 24 times forward earnings. With the midterm elections on the way this year, investors can expect some heightened volatility. So, the Small Dogs may be the perfect play for 2026 for growth and income investors wary of a major sell-off. alexei_tm / iStock via Getty Images Dividend stocks like the Small Dogs of the Dow offer investors a reliable source of passive income.

Merck & Co. Inc. (NYSE: MRK) develops and produces medicines, vaccines, biological therapies, and animal health products. It is not just a healthcare company but a global force in the industry.
