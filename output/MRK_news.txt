[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, Feb. 13, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against Merck & Co., Inc. (“Merck” or the “Company”) (NYSE: MRK) and reminds investors of the April 14, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that Merck’s expected revenue of $11 billion from sales of Gardasil by 2030. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck’s purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil’s growth in China. Defendants provided these overwhelmingly positive statements to investors while, at the same time, disseminating materially false and misleading statements and/or concealing material adverse facts concerning the true state of Gardasil’s demand in China; notably, that Merck lacked visibility into demand for Gardasil in China among eligible and otherwise targeted populations, resulting in the inflated inventory of its distributor, Zhifei. Such statements absent these material facts caused Plaintiff and other shareholders to purchase Merck’s securities at artificially inflated prices. On February 4, 2025, before the market opened, Merck filed a current report on Form 8-K with the SEC. In the current report, Merck announced their fourth-quarter and full-year 2024 financial results, in which it stated that “GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 [s]ales [d]eclined 3% to $8.6 Billion.” In addition, the current report stated Merck’s “decision to temporarily pause shipments of GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 into China beginning February 2025 through at least mid-year.” On this news, Merck’s stock price fell $9.05 per share, or 9.1%, to close at $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding Merck’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

February 12, 2025 18:31 ET | Source: Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP SAN DIEGO, Feb. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd LLP announces that purchasers or acquirers of Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE: MRK) securities between February 3, 2022 and February 3, 2025, inclusive (the “Class Period”), have until April 14, 2025 to seek appointment as lead plaintiff of the Merck class action lawsuit. Captioned Cronin v. Merck & Co., Inc., No. 25-cv-01208 (D.N.J.), the Merck class action lawsuit charges Merck and certain of Merck’s top executives with violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. If you suffered substantial losses and wish to serve as lead plaintiff of the Merck class action lawsuit, please provide your information here: https://www.rgrdlaw.com/cases-merck-co-inc-class-action-lawsuit-mrk.html You can also contact attorneys J.C. Sanchez or Jennifer N. Caringal of Robbins Geller by calling 800/449-4900 or via e-mail at info@rgrdlaw.com. CASE ALLEGATIONS: Merck operates as a healthcare company worldwide. The Merck class action lawsuit alleges that defendants throughout the Class Period made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) defendants created the false impression that they possessed reliable information pertaining to Merck’s projected revenue outlook and anticipated growth of Gardasil while also minimizing risk from competition and drug approval development, such as China’s approval to shift Gardasil to a 2-dose regimen; (ii) in truth, Merck’s optimistic reports of growth, claims of successful consumer activation and education in China, overall ability to drive demand, and efforts to downplay the impact of competition on Gardasil fell short of the reality; and (iii) Merck’s ability to push Gardasil in China had materially diminished. The Merck class action lawsuit further alleges that on July 30, 2024, Merck revealed that in the second quarter of 2024 “there was a significant step down in shipments from our distributor and commercialization partner, Zhifei, into the points of vaccination, compared with prior quarters, resulting in above normal inventory levels at Zhifei.” On this news, the price of Merck stock fell nearly 10%, according to the complaint. Then, on February 4, 2025, the Merck class action lawsuit alleges that Merck published its fourth quarter fiscal year 2024 results, disclosing that “GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 Sales Declined 3% to $8.6 Billion; Excluding the Impact of Foreign Exchange, Sales Declined 2%” “primarily due to lower demand in China, partially offset by higher demand in most international regions, particularly in Japan.” On this news, the price of Merck stock fell more than 9%, according to the complaint. THE LEAD PLAINTIFF PROCESS: The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 permits any investor who purchased or acquired Merck securities during the Class Period to seek appointment as lead plaintiff in the Merck class action lawsuit. A lead plaintiff is generally the movant with the greatest financial interest in the relief sought by the putative class who is also typical and adequate of the putative class. A lead plaintiff acts on behalf of all other class members in directing the Merck class action lawsuit. The lead plaintiff can select a law firm of its choice to litigate the Merck class action lawsuit. An investor’s ability to share in any potential future recovery is not dependent upon serving as lead plaintiff of the Merck class action lawsuit.

February 12, 2025 17:00 ET | Source: Levi & Korsinsky, LLP Levi & Korsinsky, LLP NEW YORK, Feb. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The following statement is being issued by Levi & Korsinsky, LLP: To: All persons or entities who purchased or otherwise acquired securities of Merck & Co., Inc. (“Merck” or the “Company”) (NYSE: MRK) between February 3, 2022 to February 3, 2025, both dates inclusive. You are hereby notified that the class action lawsuit Michael Cronin v. Merck & Co., Inc., et al. (Case No. 2:25-cv-01208) has been commenced in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. To get more information go to: https://zlk.com/pslra-1/merck-co-inc-lawsuit-submission-form or contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. either via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. There is no cost or obligation to you. According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning Merck’s expected revenue of $11 billion from sales of Gardasil by 2030. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in Merck’s purported ability to utilize successful consumer activation and education efforts on the benefits of Gardasil in order to drive demand and capitalize on eligible populations for vaccination, resulting in confidently optimistic reports and forecasts of Gardasil’s growth in China. The full truth finally emerged on February 4, 2025, when Merck announced it would no longer achieve the long-forecasted $11 billion in sales of Gardasil by 2030, as it would cease shipments of Gardasil to China “through at least midyear” to facilitate a “rapid reduction of inventory.” Defendants claimed this was necessitated by the continued over-inflation of overall channel inventories as demand in China for Gardasil had “not recovered to the level we had expected.” Following this news, Merck’s common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $99.79 per share on February 3, 2025, Merck’s stock price fell to $90.74 per share on February 4, 2025, a decline of more than 9% in the span of just a single day. If you suffered a loss in MRK securities, you have until April 14, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn’t require that you serve as a lead plaintiff.
