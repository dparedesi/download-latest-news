ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA - MAY 3: The Amazon logo is displayed on a sign outside of a sort center on ... More May 3, 2025 in San Diego, California. (Photo by Kevin Carter/Getty Images) Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock price is currently trading 20% below its February peak of over $240. This decline followed the imposition of tariffs by President Trump on several of the U.S.'s trading partners. Since then, the government has been actively pursuing new trade agreements, most recently achieving a landmark deal with the UK. The specifics of the U.S.-UK agreement indicate that the U.S.’s baseline 10% tariff is likely to persist for most other trading partners, with minimal exceptions. However, the exemption of steel and aluminum from tariffs in this deal suggests a greater willingness to negotiate sectoral tariffs than previously anticipated. This flexibility in the U.S.-UK deal could also foster some optimism that a trade agreement with China, a crucial factor for companies like Amazon given the significant volume of Chinese goods sold on its platform, could eventually be reached. Although Amazon undoubtedly faces inherent risks that could exert downward pressure on its stock, it's also plausible that some of these potential headwinds are already factored into the current price. Our positive assessment of Amazon’s stock stems from a comparative analysis of its present valuation against its recent operating performance, as well as its current and historical financial standing.
