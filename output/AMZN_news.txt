Title: Watch These Visa Price Levels as Stablecoins Threaten to Bypass Card Fees

Visa (V) shares slid this week after the Senate on Tuesday passed the GENIUS Act, providing a regulatory framework for companies issuing stablecoins. The crypto-friendly legislation could open the door for merchants to bypass card-based payment systems offed by Visa and other payments providers. Reports surfaced last week that Walmart (WMT) and Amazon (AMZN) were looking into launching their own stablecoins, a move that could potentially eat away at the billions of dollars the retail titans pay in credit transaction fees. Shares of Visa were little changed in Friday afternoon trading, just above $338, leaving them down about 4% for the week. Still, they've gained roughly 7% year-to-date, outpacing the S&P 500, which added less than 2% over the same period. Below, we take a closer look at Visa’s chart and use technical analysis to identify major price levels worth watching out for. Earlier this month, the stock climbed above its prominent March and May peaks, before staging a sharp reversal to form a bull trap, a trading event that lures investors to buy upon a breach of major resistance—the two peaks in this case—before the price makes a sudden move lower. As recent peaks on the chart made higher highs, the relative strength index (RSI) made comparatively shallower peaks to create a bearish divergence and indicate waning buying momentum. The stock closed decisively below the respected 50-day moving average (MA) in Wednesday’s trading session, possibly paving the way for further selling. The first support level to watch sits around $328. A retracement to this area may attract buying interest near the March swing low, which currently lies just above the upward sloping 200-day MA. A more significant drop could see the shares revisit lower support near $302. Investors may look for entry points in this region around the stock’s April sell-off low and last November’s breakaway gap. During upswings in the stock, investors should initially monitor the $350 level. The shares may face overhead selling pressure in this area near the rising 50-day MA, which currently sits alongside the late March peak and minor February trough. Buying above this level could fuel a move toward $367. Investors who have bought Visa shares at lower prices may look for exit points in this location near the March and May peaks. This level sits in the same neighborhood as a projected downside target that takes the stock’s move lower from March to April and repositions it from the May high, potentially providing clues as to how a new downtrend may play out.

Title: Amazon (AMZN) Analysis: Performance, Market Dynamics, and AI-Driven Insights as of June 17, 2025 (Serhii Bondarenko)

Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) remains a titan in the technology, e-commerce, and cloud computing sectors, consistently shaping market trends through innovation and scale. As of June 17, 2025, AMZN’s stock has exhibited robust performance, driven by its strategic investments in artificial intelligence (AI), cloud infrastructure, and operational efficiencies. This article provides a comprehensive financial analysis of AMZN’s recent market movements, key news driving its performance, a comparison with a correlated stock, insights into trading with inverse ETFs, and the role of AI-driven tools in navigating its volatility. Over the five trading days ending June 8, 2025, AMZN stock surged by 6.75%, outpacing the broader market and reflecting strong investor confidence in Amazon’s growth trajectory. This momentum continued into mid-June, with the stock rising 1.57% on June 16, 2025, according to The Motley Fool. Amazon’s year-to-date performance has been remarkable, with shares rebounding 42% from a 52-week low of $151.76, fueled by record earnings projections for 2025 and 2026. For the first quarter of 2025, Amazon reported a 62% year-over-year increase in earnings per share (EPS), with net sales reaching $155.7 billion, a 9% increase from the prior year. Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company’s cloud computing division, posted $29.3 billion in sales, up 17% year-over-year, though margins softened slightly to 39.5%. Operating income climbed 20% to $18.4 billion, surpassing estimates of $17.48 billion. Looking ahead, Amazon’s guidance for Q2 2025 projects net sales between $159 billion and $164 billion, representing approximately 9% growth at the midpoint, with operating income expected between $13 billion and $17.5 billion. The company’s forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has contracted significantly, dropping from 90 in 2021 to 30 as of March 2025, while trading at 17 times operating cash flow, its lowest ever. This suggests AMZN may be undervalued relative to its growth potential, particularly given its 50% revenue growth and doubled operating margins since 2021. However, free cash flow declined 48% over the last twelve months, reflecting heavy capital expenditures, including a $100 billion+ investment planned for 2025, primarily in AI and AWS infrastructure. Several macroeconomic and company-specific developments have influenced AMZN’s stock movement as of June 17, 2025. On June 16, the broader market saw gains, with the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq rising amid optimism over contained geopolitical tensions between Israel and Iran, boosting risk appetite. Amazon benefited from this sentiment, particularly due to its exposure to global trade. The company’s e-commerce operations, which account for nearly 40% of U.S. online sales, are poised to capitalize on easing trade tensions, as Amazon sells and facilitates imported goods. Additionally, Amazon’s partnership with Roku, announced on June 16, 2025, to create the “largest authenticated Connected TV (CTV) footprint” in the U.S. through Amazon Ads, drove a 10% surge in Roku’s stock and further bolstered AMZN’s advertising segment, which grew 18% year-over-year in Q1 2025. Amazon’s increasing reliance on AI to optimize operations, including robotics in its fulfillment network and custom silicon for AI workloads, has also garnered Wall Street attention, with analysts projecting new highs for AMZN in the second half of 2025. However, risks persist. High tariffs on Chinese imports, as noted by Zacks, could pressure Amazon’s retail margins, though the company’s diversified revenue streams—particularly AWS—mitigate this exposure. Softer-than-expected inflation data and hopes for Federal Reserve rate cuts, reported on June 12, 2025, further supported growth stocks like AMZN, as lower interest rates reduce borrowing costs for capital-intensive investments. Amazon’s stock performance is closely correlated with other mega-cap technology companies, particularly Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), due to their shared dominance in cloud computing and AI. Over the five trading days ending June 8, 2025, MSFT gained 5.2%, trailing AMZN’s 6.75% increase, indicating Amazon’s stronger short-term momentum. Both companies benefit from the surging demand for AI infrastructure, with Microsoft’s Azure competing directly with AWS. However, Amazon’s broader exposure to e-commerce and advertising provides a diversified revenue base, giving it an edge in certain market conditions. While Microsoft’s cloud growth is robust, AWS’s projected 17-20% year-over-year growth and record-high margins of 39.5% in Q1 2025 underscore Amazon’s leadership in the cloud sector. Investors eyeing AMZN may find MSFT a complementary holding, but Amazon’s multi-sector presence makes it a more versatile growth play. For traders seeking to hedge or capitalize on AMZN’s volatility, inverse ETFs like the ProShares Short QQQ (PSQ) offer a strategic tool. PSQ is designed to deliver daily inverse performance to the Nasdaq-100, which includes AMZN as a major holding. Given AMZN’s high correlation with the Nasdaq-100 (beta of approximately 1.2), PSQ provides a near-perfect anti-correlation, making it ideal for short-term strategies. When AMZN rallies, PSQ typically declines, and vice versa, allowing traders to profit from downward movements without shorting the stock directly. However, inverse ETFs carry higher risks due to daily rebalancing, which can lead to compounding losses in volatile markets. Traders must employ disciplined risk management, using tools like stop-loss orders, to mitigate these risks. Pairing AMZN with PSQ enables a balanced approach, capturing gains from bullish trends while hedging against potential corrections. The integration of AI into financial markets has transformed how investors approach stocks like AMZN. Advanced platforms leverage machine learning to analyze vast datasets, identifying patterns that human traders might miss. One such platform, led by CEO Sergey Savastiouk, utilizes Financial Learning Models (FLMs) to combine technical analysis with AI, offering precise entry and exit signals for high-liquidity stocks like AMZN. These tools, including user-friendly trading bots and Double Agents that detect both bullish and bearish signals, empower traders to navigate AMZN’s volatility with greater confidence. For instance, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) for AMZN turned positive on June 6, 2025, signaling a bullish trend that AI-driven tools could have capitalized on. Such innovations highlight the growing role of AI in optimizing trading strategies. Amazon’s stock remains a compelling option for investors seeking exposure to technology, e-commerce, and cloud computing. Its robust Q1 2025 performance, driven by AWS growth and operational efficiencies, positions it for further gains, though heavy capital expenditures and potential tariff pressures warrant caution. The company’s AI investments, including a 70% increase in in-house chip shipments projected for 2025, signal long-term growth potential. Traders can leverage AMZN’s momentum while using inverse ETFs like PSQ for hedging, supported by AI-driven tools to enhance decision-making. As market optimism grows with easing trade and geopolitical tensions, AMZN is well-positioned to lead the next phase of the tech bull market, potentially hitting new highs by year-end
