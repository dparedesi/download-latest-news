Investors greeted President Donald Trump’s reciprocal tariffs less than enthusiastically, sending the Magnificent 7 and other stocks lower. Futures linked to the the S&P 500, the Nasdaq 100, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average point to a lower opening Thursday. For the Mag 7, stock price declines in post-market trading were 4.7% for Apple (AAPL-9.76%), 3.8% for Amazon (AMZN-9.05%), 3.7% for Meta (META-8.71%), 3.6% for Tesla (TSLA-5.86%), 3.2% for Nvidia (NVDA-7.00%), 1.7% for Microsoft (MSFT-1.77%), and 2.4% for Google’s parent, Alphabet (GOOGL-3.68%). Palantir (PLTR-4.23%) fell 5.2%. General Motors (GM-4.02%) and Stellantis (STLA-9.41%) also moved lower. “One big question was: Did Trump really mean to impose the tariffs” or were they a feint aimed at drawing concessions, said Melissa Brown, head of investment decision research at SimCorp (SIM0.00%). “From what he said, it does seem more likely that he’s actually going to impose them. It’s not just talk.” That said, the implementation and effects of the tariffs are still not 100% clear, which will make it difficult for CEOs to plan, Brown told Quartz. The tariffs also make the Federal Reserve’s job much difficult because the levies could both increase costs and depress output. “I don’t think a trade war is particularly good for the stock market,” Brown said. “It’s not the death knell for the U.S. economy, but it could be very harmful for pockets of it.” The baseline 10% tariff on all countries will go into effect Saturday at 12:01 a.m. ET; the reciprocal levies are scheduled for enactment on April 9 at 12:01 a.m. ET. China will be hit with 34% tariffs, while the European Union will be slapped with 20% duties, according to a graph Trump held up at a news conference. Vietnam, Taiwan, and Japan will be hit with respective duties of 32%, 24%, and 26%. Existing import taxes on Canadian and Mexican goods won’t be affected, with exemptions for USMCA-compliant products continuing. Trump’s tariffs will close the de minimis exemption that allows small-value packages to be shipped directly, duty-free. The shares of PDD (PDD-4.84%), which owns Chinese shopping site Temu — a beneficiary of the current system — fell 4.9% in post-market trading. David Wagner, portfolio manager and head of equities at Aptus Capital, was less concerned about the tariffs, saying they’ll only affect about 15% of the economy — which continues to benefit from consumer strength and a strong labor market. “There’s a buffer here where consumers can absorb the tariffs and continue to spend,” Wagner said. He added that the strong dollar will help moderate the duties’ impact and that there’s “no playbook” for this situation. “No one knows the ramifications of tariffs and the threats and how other countries will react,” Wagner said.

Title: Elon Musk says his DOGE gig has cost him and Tesla 'a lot'

Elon Musk acknowledged that his role overseeing President Donald Trump’s efforts to slash federal spending is costing him — and Tesla (TSLA-5.86%) — “a lot.” Backlash over Musk’s job leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) was swift and has grown in recent weeks as the group continues to direct the Trump administration’s approach to downsizing the government. Musk claimed last week that DOGE cuts an average of $4 billion in federal spending each day. His Tesla has become an easy target for protesters angered by his support of Trump and his work in the federal government. Non-violent, anti-Tesla protests have been held across the U.S. and other countries, while vandalism against the company’s customers and facilities has ramped up. Forty-seven percent of voters surveyed by NBC News (CMCSA-2.23%) earlier this month had a negative view of DOGE, while 51% had a negative view of Musk himself. The idea of DOGE, however, was more popular, with 46% calling it a good idea and 40% saying it was bad. “What they’re trying to do is put massive pressure on me, and Tesla I guess, to you know, I don’t know, stop doing this,” Musk said on Sunday. “My Tesla stock and the stock of everyone who holds Tesla has gone, went roughly in half. I mean it’s a big deal.” Telsa shares hit a record price of $479.86 at its post-election fueled peak on Dec. 17, but most of those gains have since been wiped out. The stock has fallen by more than 30% year-to-date, sending Musk’s net worth down $102 billion to $330 billion. He still has a more than $100 billion lead over the next richest person in the world, Amazon (AMZN-9.05%) founder Jeff Bezos. Tesla stock dropped by more than 5% to $248 per share in pre-market trading on Monday as investors await weaker first-quarter sales than previously expected. Deliveries are expected to have taken a hit from the “Tesla Takedown” protests that have continued to put pressure on Tesla, as well as weaker sales in Europe and China. “Long term I think Tesla stock’s going to do fine, so maybe it’s a buying opportunity,” Musk said from a political event in Wisconsin, where he took the stage wearing a cheesehead hat. The Tesla CEO was in Wisconsin on Sunday to support Brad Schimel, who has been endorsed by Republicans in the state’s Supreme Court election scheduled for Tuesday. Musk and his allies have spent more than $20 million campaigning across the state. On Sunday, Musk handed out $1 million checks to two local voters who had expressed support for Schimel and signed a petition supporting his candidacy. A third individual had earlier received a $1 million check. Those people were also named as spokespeople for his America PAC, a tactic that allows the group to side-step accusations of running an illegal lottery. A similar strategy was employed by Musk to hand out $1 million checks to more than a dozen people during the 2024 presidential election. “Easiest money you ever made!” Musk said on Monday, advocating for people to get Wisconsin residents to sign America PAC’s petition and post a photo supporting Schimel. “Every time you do that you get $20 and they get $20. The goal is to build awareness about the election tomorrow, so this offer applies to today and tomorrow.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.
