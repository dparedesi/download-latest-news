ByJoe Cornell ByJoe Cornell Contributor. (AP Photo/Richard Drew, File) Deal OverviewAs per media articles on March 17, 2025, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN; $196.21, Market Capitalization: $2.1 trillion), the world’s largest e-commerce company, is considering spinning off its India business and listing it on the domestic stock market. If implemented, this strategy would enable Amazon to strengthen its foothold in one of the rapidly expanding digital markets while adhering to India’s stringent e-commerce regulations. Data localization requirements and the ability to maintain direct inventory are among the key factors driving this consideration. Indian regulations only permit domestic companies to use an inventory model in e-commerce, limiting foreign players like Amazon from operating under a marketplace model. Post-separation, Amazon India (SpinCo) would retain its existing operations, including an online marketplace, which would continue to offer a diverse range of products across various categories to cater to the Indian market. In addition to its e-commerce platform, it will also continue to own Amazon Prime platform for an expedited shipping and streaming service, Amazon Pay for digital payments, and Amazon Business for B2B transactions. Amazon.com Inc Price Performance Spin-Off Details and Top 5 Shareholders On the other hand, Amazon (RemainCo) would remain focused on its core operations, including e-commerce, cloud computing, online advertising, digital streaming, and artificial intelligence services. The separation would enable the company to allocate resources more efficiently while allowing Amazon India to focus on local expansion and innovation. Amazon has begun conversations with banking advisors regarding a potential spin-off and local listing in India. Recently, the company’s management, including senior executives from India and the US, held discussions with a couple of investment bankers, including its Wall Street banker, JP Morgan. While these discussions are in the preliminary stages, they signify Amazon’s intent to adapt its business model to better align with local market dynamics and regulatory frameworks. Deal Rationale Amazon India, a subsidiary of Amazon.com, Inc., operates as an online marketplace, offering various products across various categories to cater to the Indian market. In addition to its e-commerce platform, Amazon India provides services such as Amazon Prime for an expedited shipping and streaming service, Amazon Pay for digital payments, and Amazon Business for B2B transactions. Amazon’s consideration to spin off its Indian division and pursue a domestic listing is likely influenced by several strategic factors dependent on the dynamics of the Indian market. One of the key factors is India’s regulatory framework, which prohibits companies with foreign direct investment of 51.0% or more from running inventory based e-commerce operations. These regulations mandate that foreign companies function as marketplaces connecting buyers and sellers, limiting their control over inventory management. In contrast, domestic companies can manage inventory directly, enabling faster deliveries, improved branding, and reduced shipping costs. By spinning off its Indian operations into a locally listed entity, Amazon could potentially navigate these restrictions more effectively, aligning its business model with local regulations. Another significant factor is data localization. Indian regulations mandate that data generated within the country must be stored locally. By creating a separate entity for its Indian operations, Amazon can ensure compliance with these regulations more effectively, thereby avoiding potential legal and operational challenges. In recent years, Amazon has also faced certain challenges in India, losing market share to Flipkart, which now holds around half of the country’s e-commerce market. Furthermore, it is encountering increasing competition from SoftBank-backed Meesho, which recently raised over $500 million in new funding. The company’s recent struggles in the quick commerce segment have also likely influenced the spin-off decision. While pilot services have begun, it faces stiff competition from established players such as Flipkart’s Minutes, JioMart, Swiggy Instamart, Blinkit, and Zepto, all of which have a strong foothold in the segment. A spin-off could enable Amazon to compete more effectively by aligning its operations closely with local market dynamics. The Indian e-commerce market is projected to grow from $123 billion in 2024 to $292.3 billion in 2028, reflecting a CAGR of 18.7%. This rapid growth presents a compelling opportunity for Amazon. A more autonomous and locally attuned entity would position Amazon to capitalize on this growth. We believe, a spinoff would enable the company to tailor its strategies more precisely to local consumer behaviors and preferences, enhancing its competitiveness against domestic rivals. In summary, Amazon’s potential spinoff and domestic listing of its Indian business are driven by regulatory navigation, market growth opportunities, and localization strategies. This strategic move aims to align Amazon’s operations more closely with India’s unique market dynamics, positioning it for sustained success in the region.
