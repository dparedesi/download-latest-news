We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Tesla's (TSLA) stock has known only one direction in February: reverse. Shares of the Elon Musk-led EV maker dropped another 2% to $321 each in pre-market trading on Wednesday, continuing an eye-opening slide from their recent 52-week high. At its current pre-market price, Tesla's stock is down 33% since hitting a record high on Dec. 18, 2024, weeks after the Election Day win for President Donald Trump — who was heavily backed by Musk. The stock is the worst-performing member of the closely watched "Magnificent Seven" group of tech megacaps: Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Apple (AAPL). Musk's net worth — which is closely connected to the fortunes of Tesla — has plunged $54 billion year to date, according to Bloomberg data. He is still the richest person in the world with a net worth of $378 billion "The bears are owning the narrative," Wedbush analyst Dan Ives told me. And the bears have a lot to feast on regarding Tesla at the moment. For starters, numbers on Tesla sales in important overseas markets have come in soft to kick off the year. The readings have triggered some concerns in Tesla circles that Musk's close proximity to Trump is damaging its brand. Tesla sold 63,238 vehicles in China in January, according to data released this week by the China Passenger Car Association. The figure marked a steep 33% drop from December. At the same time, Australia's Electric Vehicle Council reported that Tesla's overall sales fell 33% year over year in January. "We're cautious on what's happening for the EV maker," Oppenheimer analyst Colin Rusch said on Yahoo Finance's Market Domination. Meanwhile, fresh tariffs from the Trump administration stand to raise costs for Tesla and other automakers. On Monday, the president signed two executive orders imposing additional 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum. Both steel and aluminum are key raw materials used by Tesla. Trump's new trade war with China doesn't help either — a 2023 study by Nikkei found that 40% of the suppliers for materials used in Tesla's batteries are Chinese companies. "Changes in government and economic policies, incentives or tariffs may also impact our production, sales, cost structure and the competitive landscape," Tesla pointed out in its latest 10-K filing. And last, Tesla's fourth quarter left a lot to be desired. The company's EPS missed analyst estimates by a penny. Automotive sales fell 8% year over year alongside price cuts across the Tesla vehicle lineup. Podcast: how Musk delivers on his biggest promises "There's a bit of a disconnect, in our view, between what's happening fundamentally and what's happening from a sentiment perspective," Rusch said. The Oppenheimer analyst is also concerned that even with the sell-off in the stock, Tesla remains overvalued. Yahoo Finance data shows Tesla shares are valued at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 111 times. The forward PE ratio for the S&P 500 is about 22 times. Auto rivals Ford (F) and GM (GM) are valued at PE multiples of 6 times and 4 times, respectively. Rusch thinks Tesla's valuation will be "a little bit challenged" in the coming years, unless the company can "deliver on a number of promises" it has made to investors such as robotaxis and humanoids.

Title: Here are Three Reasons to Like Amazon.com (AMZN)

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published a list of Top 10 AI Stocks to Watch In February. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against other top AI stocks to watch in February. Barry Bannister, Stifel’s chief equity strategist, said in a latest program on CNBC that the macroeconomic factors are finally catching up to the AI-led bull market. He expects inflation to remain sticky and no further rate cuts from the Federal Reserve in the short term. The analyst also rejected the notion that the massive tech selloff after the launch of DeepSeek was a buying opportunity. “Over 30 years ago, we used to joke about how technology was such a displacement event business where new competitors would come in and destroy the entrenched stocks, that it deserved a lower multiple because of that. It’s a short life cycle business that’s got a very short competitive advantage period. But investors forgot about that. They bid up the stocks. The growth relative to value large-cap total return, one divided by the other on a 10-year compound basis, reached the absolute outer limits of the past 90 years. And that exact limit line is exactly where it peaked—the price earnings multiple and the outperformance of growth. So, for us, it’s just a very bubbly market that’s just gotta take some air out of it.” READ ALSO 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In For this article, we chose 10 AI stocks currently making moves in the market. With each stock, we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Copyright: prykhodov / 123RF Stock Photo Number of Hedge Fund Investors: 286 Jessica Inskip, Director of Investor Research at StockBrokers, explained in a latest program on Schwab Network her top three reasons to be bullish on Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). “I really do like Amazon, and there’s three primary reasons. First and foremost, of course, is AI. They have AI-driven cloud growth as AI agents are being developed, and that’s extremely important. The other is the impending TikTok ban. A ban may not be imminent, but platform diversification certainly is. One of the next innovations that I think we’ll see with the e-commerce space is the use of short-form video. That’s the next innovation that could lead to retail margin expansion with e-commerce sales from the Amazon front. Then the third, and maybe overlooked, is the AWS operational cost. I think that would be lowered actually with a stronger US dollar. The US dollar, as we see, is strengthening. I heard your previous guest even say that as well, and since many of AWS’s operational costs tend to be outside of the US, therefore that stronger dollar would actually just naturally help lower those operational costs. So, a lot working for Amazon in terms of margin expansion.” Simply beating earnings estimates is not enough for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) anymore, and the impact of high expectations will continue to weigh on the stock as growth cools. Nvidia’s forward P/E ratio for the fiscal year ending January 2026 is around 31. An EPS surprise of 8.5% was not able to help the stock. A similar trend occurred following the second-quarter earnings after a 5.6% EPS surprise. It’s difficult to see Nvidia maintaining a mid-70s gross margin by the end of 2026. Over the last two quarters, Nvidia has already reported a drop in its gross margin from 78% to 74.5%. Then there’s competition. Amazon (AMZN) recently disclosed its Trainium 3 chip, which is set to be released by the end of 2025. The chip is expected to be twice as fast with 40% more power efficiency than the previous generation, manufactured on TSMC’s (TSM) cutting-edge N3 technology. Vulcan Value Partners stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q4 2024 investor letter: “There were five material contributors to performance: Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Salesforce Inc., Live Nation Entertainment Inc., Carlyle Group Inc., and Alphabet Inc. Amazon.com is a dominant, world class company with powerful secular tailwinds in place including its e-commerce penetration, digital advertising growth, and the cloud transition. Amazon reported strong results during the quarter. The market is beginning to reward the company for its untapped margin opportunity in the core retail business as its consolidated operating margins expanded.” Overall, AMZN ranks 1st on our list of top AI stocks to watch in February. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: 3 new reasons to dump Magnificent 7 stocks
URL: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-new-reasons-to-dump-magnificent-7-stocks-200016898.html
Time Published: 2025-02-11T20:00:16Z

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. With the often-hot Magnificent Seven trade on the skids less than two months into the year, it may be time to exit stage left before the selling picks up. "Over the last several years we have maintained the view, that it was prudent for long-only US equity managers to be at least market-weight the Mag 7. Today, our views have evolved to the point where we are changing our mind and believe lowering exposure is prudent," Trivariate Research founder and CEO Adam Parker said in a new note Tuesday. The Magnificent Seven trade of Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA) has underwhelmed of late. Only one of the big-cap tech components — Meta — has posted double-digit gains out of the box, more in line with the sector's usual strong performance. Amazon is the only other Mag Seven component to be up on the year to the tune of 5.2%, slightly ahead of the 3.5% increase for the S&P 500 (^GSPC). Alphabet, Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Tesla are all down year to date, with an average drop of 3% based on Yahoo Finance's calculations. Tesla is the worst performer, off by 17% this year. Reasons for the sell-off range from weakening sales (Tesla) to rising fears tech companies are spending too much to build AI infrastructure (the rest of the Mag Seven). Veteran markets expert Parker thinks now is a good time for investors to reduce exposure for three reasons. For one, the Street is unlikely to stop scrutinizing how much is being spent on capex for AI in 2025 and 2026. Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet are slated to spend a cumulative $325 billion in capital expenditures and investments this year, Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports. This would mark a 46% increase year over year for the four tech stalwarts. Amazon alone sees $104 billion in capital expenditures this year, well above prior analyst forecasts of $80 billion to $85 billion. The stocks have tended to react negatively to these bold spending commitments, points out Parker. "There is no question either way that the high capital spending will continue to come under increasing scrutiny until investors can better understand the return on today’s massive investments," says Parker. Valuation on Mag Seven stocks — despite their sell-off — also remains a concern for Parker. Parker's research shows the relative price to forward earnings multiple of the Mag Seven versus the rest of the S&P 500 is at a 42% premium. That's toward the upper range of its 25-year average. Warns Parker, "The high beta and increasingly high capital intensity combined with the elevated valuation of the Magnificent 7 is, in our judgment, an increasing cause for concern." Podcast: Buy, sell, or hold Mag 7 darling Nvidia? And lastly, the stocks just look too over-owned by investors. "We are apprehensive of the elevated beta-adjusted exposure of the Mag 7 vs. the top 500 US equities excluding the Mag-7. Today, the aggregate exposure of the Mag 7 is 31.3%, or almost a third of the market cap opportunity is Mag-7. However, on a beta-adjusted basis the current exposure of the Mag-7 is 44.7%. This means that a portfolio manager who owns in market-weight all the Magnificent 7 stocks has nearly half their fund’s beta-adjusted exposure in these stocks! This remains near highs of the last 25 years," Parker said. One bonus reason Yahoo Finance found when studying Parker's research: The stocks have an outsized exposure to all-out Wall Street bullishness. Only 4.8% of the 504 analyst recommendations on the Mag Seven are a Sell, Parker's team found. With the investment thesis on the Mag Seven changing, the uber-bullishness could prove to be misaligned with reality. — Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

Title: Why Tesla's stock has been cratering

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Elon Musk may be President Trump's first buddy, but Tesla (TSLA) investors have swung back to focusing more on the company's fundamentals than the billionaire's close proximity to the Resolute desk. Their decision? To send Tesla's stock tumbling less than two months into 2025. Shares of the electric vehicle maker led by Musk are down 28% to $349.18 since hitting a record high on Dec. 18, 2024, weeks after the Election Day win for Trump. The stock is the worst-performing member of the closely watched "Magnificent Seven," which includes Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Google (GOOG), and Apple (AAPL). At the time, enthusiasm was running high that Musk's fierce support of Trump would unlock big-time profits as driverless cars would get quicker approval — among other bullish lines of thinking. But since reaching that peak, Tesla's stock has fallen below its key 50-day moving average, according to Yahoo Finance data. The next test of investor sentiment on Tesla is coming at $334, or the 100-day moving average. Should the stock break below that important support level, it could have a clear shot to the 200-day moving average of $286. Tesla's 52-week low is $142.05 hit on April 22, 2024. "Given the considerable run up in the shares as performance and expected future performance have by equal measure deteriorated, we sense a high risk of mean reversion (including by potential catalysts that may be difficult to foresee at present) and for this reason continue to recommend caution with regard to an investment in Tesla shares," JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman wrote in a new client note. Brinkman is one of the most bearish sell-side analysts on Tesla, with an Underperform rating and $135 price target. The reasons Tesla's stock is under pressure are numerous. For one, numbers on Tesla sales from important overseas markets have come in soft to kick off the year. The readings have triggered some concerns in Tesla circles that Musk's close proximity to Trump is damaging its brand. Tesla sold 63,238 vehicles in China in January, according to new data released this week from China Passenger Car Association (CPCA). The figure marked a steep 33% drop from December. Australia's Electric Vehicle Council (EVC) reported Tesla's overall sales fell 33% year over year in January. Meanwhile, fresh tariffs from President Trump stand to raise costs for Tesla and other EV makers. On Monday, Trump signed two executive orders imposing new 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum. Both steel and aluminum are key raw materials used by Tesla. Trump's new trade war with China doesn't help either — a 2023 study by Nikkei found that 40% of the suppliers for materials used in Tesla's batteries are Chinese companies. "Changes in government and economic policies, incentives or tariffs may also impact our production, sales, cost structure and the competitive landscape," Tesla pointed out in its latest 10-K filing. And lastly, Tesla's fourth quarter left a lot to be desired. The company's EPS missed analyst estimates by a penny. Automotive sales fell 8% year over year due to price cuts across the Tesla vehicle lineup. "They missed their 2024 delivery guidance, which we knew about a month ago. Their margins were pretty weak ... And, if we're reading this correctly, the full self-driving rollout in Europe and China is not going to happen in the first quarter," Canaccord Genuity managing director George Gianarikas said on Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief, calling the results "kind of squishy." Yahoo Finance data shows analysts have aggressively marked down earnings per share estimates on Tesla for 2025 and 2026 in the wake of the lackluster earnings report. "Tesla faces a variety of risks given its broad reach. On automotive, we believe the largest risk is demand softness/stagnation related to EV fatigue and/or competition," Deutsche Bank analyst Edison Yu pointed out in a note.

Title: Why the Federal Reserve could shock the markets this summer: Economist

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, or wherever you find your favorite podcasts. If there is shock coming to markets, it could arrive this summer. And it could be in the form of a rate hike from the Federal Reserve. Apollo Global Management chief economist Torsten Slok says the US economy is already running at a healthy 3% Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth pace, supported by high stock prices, investments in AI data centers by the likes of Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN), and strong defense spending. Layering on Trump tariffs would add fuel to the economic fire and drive up inflation, warns the veteran economist. "So if with that backdrop we have policies that are now lifting inflation modestly from an already too high level, then my view would certainly be that then maybe we are not done with the Fed hiking rates. There is a risk that we could still have a rate hike later this year," Slok told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen in below). Slok believes that should inflation accelerate as tariffs take hold, the first rate hike from Fed could come at its mid-June meeting. More may follow, Slok says, which could surprise a market that has settled into the view of the Fed standing pat on rates this year — if not lowering them further. "If we have a significant increase in inflation because of a strong economy and potentially some policies that give a modest lift to inflation, then you could have several hikes later this year," Slok added. The seeds for a renewed bout of inflation are being planted. On Monday, president Trump signed two executive orders imposing new 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum. Last Tuesday, the president imposed a 10% tariff on all Chinese imports on top of existing tariffs on the country. China retaliated, placing tariffs on select chips and metals. It also began investigating Google (GOOG) and blacklisted US apparel brands Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, operated by PVH Corp. (PVH). Trump recently agreed to pause 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico for 30 days. Estimates on the impact of tariffs on inflation vary, but economists agree there will some consequences. A new report from Deutsche Bank economists project the steel and aluminum tariffs alone could boost the core personal expenditures price index (PCE) — a key read on inflation — by 0.4%. Should the tariffs on Mexico and Canada go through, inflation could rise more than 3.5%, Deutsche Bank said. On this front, Goldman Sachs economists estimated "long-term" 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico imports could lift the PCE by 0.7% and hurt GDP by 0.4%. Slok says the market hasn't priced in the prospect of rate hikes yet. The markets would be forced to adjust their profit estimates lower, explained Goldman Sachs chief US strategist David Kostin. If the US implements sustained tariffs on exports consistent with those currently outlined, it would likely cut earnings per share for the S&P 500 by 2% to 3%, Kostin found. “If company managements decide to absorb the higher input costs, then profit margins would be squeezed. If companies pass along the higher costs to end customers, then sales volumes may suffer. Firms may try to push back on their suppliers and ask them to absorb part of the cost of the tariff through lower prices," said Kostin. — Three times each week, I field insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

We recently published a list of 10 AI News Updates You Should Not Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against other AI news updates you should not miss. Europe is putting itself on the artificial map with France and the United Arab Emirates having agreed to a framework accord for a 1 gigawatt data center dedicated to artificial intelligence. The French presidency said in a statement that the center will be the core of a new AI “campus” and will have up to 1 gigawatt of capacity, “which represents investments of 30 to 50 billion euros”. READ ALSO: Top 10 AI Stocks Trending On Wall Street and 12 High-Flying AI Stocks This Week The move is said to be a part of a larger AI agreement signed between French President Emmanuel Macron and his UAE counterpart Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan in Paris. President Emmanuel Macron hosted his Emirati counterpart on Thursday. “The two leaders expressed their desire to create a strategic partnership in the field of AI and committed to exploring collaborations on projects and investments supporting the development of the AI ​​value chain”. According to the leaders, the investments would go into both French and Emirati AI and would include buying advanced chips, building data centers, talent development, and establishing virtual data embassies to secure AI and cloud systems in both countries. France is also going to be hosting the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Action Summit at the Grand Palais on February 10-11, 2025. The country has deemed the summit a “wake-up call” for Europe in the global race for AI. “The summit comes at exactly the right time for this wake-up call for France and Europe, and to show we are in position” to take advantage of the technology, an official in Macron’s office told reporters. Attendees at the summit will include Sam Altman, head of OpenAI, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and Nobel Prize winner Demis Hassabis, who leads the company’s DeepMind AI research unit, amongst many other industry leaders, government officials, and similar figures from around the world. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) is an American technology company offering e-commerce, cloud computing, and other services, including digital streaming and artificial intelligence solutions. On February 7, RBC Capital analyst Brad Erickson raised the firm’s price target on the stock to $265 from $255 and kept an “Outperform” rating on the shares. The analyst told investors in a research note that the company’s Q4 results were mixed with a slight miss on third-party seller services and advertising revenues. There is also an implied $100B+ capex guide. These factors outweigh the company’s solid figures from Amazon Web Services (AWS) and continued EBITDA outperformance. The firm also stated that Amazon.com shares are “crowded” and the AI “spend money to make money” debate will undoubtedly continue, but AWS’s high margin growth and further network cost efficiencies will help the company grow its earnings at a level that justifies its valuation. Overall, AMZN ranks 1st on our list of AI news updates you should not miss. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

Title: The Magnificent 7 trade is struggling — Here's why

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. The Magnificent Seven has turned into the Stupendous One as AI spending fears weigh on sentiment. The usually reliably hot Magnificent Seven trade of Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla (TSLA) has underwhelmed more than one month into 2025. Only one of the big-cap tech components — Meta — has notched double-digit gains out of the box. In fact, shares of Meta have risen for 15 straight sessions through Monday — bringing its year-to-date advance to a stellar (or stupendous...) 20%. Amazon is the only other Mag Seven component to be up on the year to the tune of 5.9%, slightly ahead of the 3.4% increase for the S&P 500 (^GSPC). Alphabet, Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Tesla are all down year to date, with an average drop of 3% based on Yahoo Finance's calculations. Tesla is the worst performer on the year, down 6% as it has been hit with less-than-inspiring sales news from across the world. Tariff concerns have also weighed on the stock, similar to other auto plays like General Motors (GM) and Ford (F). Digging deeper, six out of seven Mag Seven members have reported fourth quarter earnings so far: All but Meta are down since their reports. Alphabet is down the most at 10.4%, as the Street reacted very negatively to its initial 2025 outlook. "Price reactions suggest growing concerns around monetization vs. capex for hyperscalers," said BofA strategist Savita Subramanian in a client note on Monday. To Subramanian's point, the capital expenditure numbers being tossed for 2025 by Big Tech to build out AI infrastructure have been eye-popping — and have caught investors off guard. Collectively, they have the Street worried about whether profit margins for the Mag Seven hit a short-term peak in 2024. Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet are slated to spend a cumulative $325 billion in capital expenditures and investments this year, Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports. This would mark a 46% increase year over year for the four tech stalwarts. Amazon alone sees $104 billion in capital expenditures this year, well above prior analyst forecasts of $80 billion to $85 billion. RBC Capital Markets analyst Brad Erickson warned last week Mag Seven names such as Amazon are "crowded" trades and that the "AI 'spend money to make money' debate will undoubtedly continue." The question now beginning to circulate on the Street is if Mag Seven weakness bleeds into the broader market. If so, it could have an outsized impact on stocks not directly tied to tech. The combined weighting of the Mag Seven within the S&P 500 surged from 21.9% in 2020 to over 30% in 2024, the highest concentration ever recorded, according to data from First Trust. "While the main S&P 500 index has been able to hold up incredibly well in the face of the Mag 7 weakness, should the market get further concerning news on tariffs, and/or inflation, the indices could be susceptible for a much larger decline than we have seen thus far given the overall weakness from the top-weighted names. In addition, should these names remain under pressure that likely puts a 'cap' to the index upside in the shorter-term given their importance," explains 22V Research strategist Jeff Jacobson. A near-term test for the Mag Seven bulls will come with Feb. 26 earnings from Nvidia, says Jacobson. — Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

Earnings season continues this week, with notable economic releases for inflation and consumer ... [+] spending. However, with President Trump threatening reciprocal tariffs, fundamental data could take a backseat to politics. With almost two-thirds of the fourth-quarter earnings season complete, the pace slows slightly with 77 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report. Seventy-seven percent of S&P 500 firms reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter. Two of the Magnificent 7 reported earnings last week, with only Nvidia (NVDA) remaining on February 26. The Magnificent 7 consists of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Tesla (TSLA). S&P 500 Earnings Season Despite robust earnings growth and a noisy but solid jobs report, concerns about President Donald Trump’s threatened additional tariffs and some worries about artificial intelligence spending caused some market consternation. The S&P 500 fell 0.2% for the week, but the Magnificent 7 lost 2.8%. Market Returns According to FactSet data, industrials, consumer discretionary, and healthcare contributed most significantly to last week's earnings growth improvement, while the industrials sector was the largest detractor. Uber Technologies (UBER) was the most significant contributor to industrials, with Amazon.com (AMZN) being the most critical contributor to the consumer discretionary sector. Within healthcare, earnings beats by Pfizer (PFE) and Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) increased the earnings growth rate. The financial sector is expected to show the most rapid year-over-year growth rate in the S&P 500, followed by communications services and consumer discretionary. The energy sector is at the bottom, with a forecasted almost twenty-eight percent decline in year-over-year earnings. Estimated Earnings By Sector Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. At this point in the earnings season, sales growth at 5.2% exceeds expectations, with the tailwind from 5% year-over-year nominal GDP growth. Estimated Sales By Sales Due primarily to the robust earnings growth for financials, communication services, and consumer discretionary, the blended earnings performance has significantly outperformed expectations at the end of the quarter. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at +16.4% year-over-year, above the expectation of +11.9% at the end of the quarter. S&P 500 Earnings Summary Because these companies are a critical driver of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 are the group to watch this earnings season. Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) reported last week. While earnings growth was robust for both, it was below very high expectations, and the stocks were sent lower for the week. Separately, investors are questioning whether both companies' increased AI infrastructure spending will yield a good return on investment. Looking at Alphabet specifically, their cloud business revenue, including AI infrastructure demand, grew by 30% year-over-year, but that slowed from the 35% growth in the previous quarter. Notably, the company said capacity constraints, not demand, were the issue. The company expects to spend about $75 billion in 2025 on additional AI infrastructure, an increase of 43% over 2024. Aside from focusing on AI, Alphabet’s core businesses, search and YouTube, performed well in the quarter. Nvidia (NVDA) is the final group member to report earnings, scheduled for February 26. The introduction of DeepSeek led to worries that demand for their AI chips might falter, so the stock had been down over 20% from its peak until last week’s 8% rally. Alphabet and Amazon announced significant increases in capital spending to meet AI capacity demands, which helped reduce worries that a decline in demand for NVIDIA’s chipsets could be imminent. Notable companies reporting this week are McDonald’s (MCD), Coca-Cola (KO), Humana (HUM), Kraft Heinz (KHC), Applied Materials (AMAT), and Airbnb (ABNB). Magnificent 7: Q4 Earnings Growth It was a noisy monthly jobs report on Friday. Non-farm payrolls grew by 143,000 in January, which was below consensus. More recent months were revised higher but offset by downward revisions to farther out months. Both household employment measures are distorted by a much higher than typical adjustment for immigration-related adjustments. These adjustments also helped send the unemployment rate down to 4%. The workweek fell to a 5-year low of 34.1 hours, and hourly earnings rose more than expected. Though the government said that the numbers showed no impact from the L.A. fires and weather conditions, it seems likely that there was an impact, so it's best to take this month’s job data with a grain of salt. Monthly Job Growth Looking at other labor market data for some clarity, initial claims for unemployment benefits remain low, so there is no sign of a collapse in the job market. Initial Jobless Claims Given the mixed and noisy monthly jobs report, markets and the Federal Reserve (Fed) will wait for more straightforward data to make any decisions about the economy. The Fed is expected to be on the sidelines until mid-year when it might resume short-term interest rate cuts. Regarding the U.S. economy, the crucial releases will be Wednesday’s consumer inflation (CPI) and Friday’s retail sales numbers. CPI is expected to hold steady at an above-target 2.9% rate, but the details will be more critical with housing costs and services inflation closely watched. Retail sales are expected to slow from December’s rapid pace, but the U.S. consumer is the lifeblood of the economy. U.S. CPI Inflation Estimate Earnings season slows, but plenty of important companies are reporting this week. Fundamental data could take a backseat to politics. President Trump announced he would roll out reciprocal tariffs this week to match the levies other countries put on U.S. imports. Markets would probably see these as positive relative to the original thought of a 10% to 20% global tariff, but it would almost certainly add the European Union to the targeted regions. The duration of the higher tariffs, retaliatory action by impacted countries, the strength of the U.S. dollar, and the ability to switch to domestically produced or imports from non-impacted countries will impact any price increases or demand shocks caused by the tariffs, so the ultimate result is impossible to know. In any case, markets dislike uncertainty, so tariff news should add to volatility. Disclosure: Glenview Trust holds many stocks mentioned in this article within its recommended investment strategies.
