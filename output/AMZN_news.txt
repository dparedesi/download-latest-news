Title: Ways To Invest In Tesla Beyond Buying TSLA Stock

© 2024 Bloomberg Finance LP Tesla (TSLA) is one of the most closely followed and debated stocks. That’s what happens when you create a new industry (electric vehicles) and trade in a price range from $100 to $400, and back to $100 again, all within a few years time. And let’s not forget the emergence of Tesla founder Elon Musk on the political front. All this may lead investors to wonder how best to get exposure to Tesla stock, other than buying it directly. That’s where exchange-traded funds can represent a wide range of “access points” for different types of objectives. Popular indexes like the S&P 500 have ETFs that allow investors to profit from its declines, to earn extra income from it via option positions, and to add leverage. More recently, allowing investors to put those types of enhancements around individual stocks has been a priority for some ETF product creators. But in the case of Tesla, we might just have the widest array of choices for how to “drive” your profits forward. Here are seven I picked out, and how I’d potentially use them. Note that these are my own observations and research. They are not recommendations, simply a way to expand the range of what is possible for investors who don’t drill down on this as I have been doing for decades.

AMZN is 22% and Home Depot (HD) checks in at 8%. So nearly half of XLY is in these three stocks. XLY has $24.3 billion in assets under management and a low expense ratio of 0.09%. I want to own Tesla but with some diversification around it. This is one way in which my approach to ETF investing is likely very different from most. I like concentrated funds, since it allows me to zero in on a smaller basket of names that at times are really all I want from that market segment. I don't need a piece of 93 stocks in a single sector! This is for investors who prefer to reduce the risk of any single stock. The focus of this ETF is long-term growth of capital achieved by investing in companies that benefit from the development of new products and technologies, such as autonomous mobility, intelligent devices, adaptive robotics, neural networks, reusable rockets and advanced batteries. Tesla is ARKQ’s top holding (17% of assets). ARKQ has total assets of $968 million and an expense ratio of 0.75%. Complements TSLA exposure with allocations to defense, cybersecurity and space exploration. Volatility. Made a big “round trip” in price the past three years, losing 50% and then gaining 100% to net out to a break-even over that period. I want to own TSLA and other autonomous tech stocks, but not Amazon. This is also a diversification move around Tesla stock, though using a thematic group of stocks instead of just those in the same consumer discretionary sector. This is TSLA times 2, though it is not always that simple. As with all ETFs that, like this one, employ leverage, the concept of making 2x the gain or loss of TSLA should be assumed to only be good on a daily basis.Still when TSLA goes on one of those manic upside runs, 2x is an attractive consideration to me. TSLL has an expense ratio of 0.96%. “All bulled up” on Tesla, with potential to make twice as much as owning the regular common stock. What Tesla giveth twice as much, it also taketh away twice as much. Since I'm a chartist at the core, I can decide to buy a good TSLA chart or buy a good TSLL chart with half the assets at risk. This ETF might appeal to those who are comfortable with leverage, pursuing twice the gain with twice the risk. Leveraged ETFs are a relatively new creation. Single inverse ETFs have been around since 2006. And that means I've been using them liberally for 18 years. The ones that move opposite major market indexes have been a "go-to" for me as an offense-defense investor since prior to the global financial crisis. Newer on the scene are single stock inverse ETFs, such as the ones offered by Direxion, T-Rex and other fund firms. Again, the daily objective means that longer time periods often will not be the mirror image of the underlying "long" stock performance. TSLS has an expense ratio of 1.07%. Efficient way to essentially “short” TSLA, on a 1:1 daily basis. Investors tend to undereducate themselves on the “math of investment loss.” In other words, if TSLA goes up 20% as it has done in short time periods many times, this would drop approximately 20%. But that means you need to make 25% just to get back to even, not 20%. When I think TSLA is overpriced short-to-intermediate term, and want to try to profit from a potential decline of some magnitude. TSLS could appeal to those who wish to try to profit from a decline in TSLA. Note that big “round trip” move I noted at the start of this article.

That would not have worked well if held throughout 2024. But don't be fooled by that full-year summary. During the course of this, its first full year of existence, TSLZ has had 1-month up moves of 80%, 50% and 30%. These are tactical vehicles, period. Potentially a “cleaner” way to try to capitalize on declines in Tesla stock than using put options. That’s because TSLA is so volatile, buying options can be very expensive. I own TSLA but am concerned about its near-term price picture, so I can consider this to hedge some of that, and try to avoid the full downside risk. Or, I can use this to try to profit from the next major dip in TSLA. For those who don’t just think the stock will fall, but do so quickly, this ETF, like other inverse funds, aims to be held for short time periods. This is another in the series from YieldMax ETFs that I've written about here recently. TSLY aims to deliver a very high income return and a total return of about 80% of the ups and downs of TSLA stock. TSLY has total assets of $1.0 billion and an expense ratio of 1.0% Big income payout, aims to capture about 80% of up moves in TSLA on a total return basis. Tends to track about 80% of the downside in the stock. Bullish on TSLA but prefer to earn more of my total return as income, with some upside potential beyond that. This relatively new ETF might appeal to those who want to ride along with Tesla, but exchange some potential capital appreciation for current income. Finally, another one from YieldMax, but a departure from their core product line. This fund, which has an expense ratio of 0.99%, started trading in May, so I'll use this directly from the fund management firm: YieldMax Short TSLA Option Income Strategy ETF is an actively managed ETF that seeks to generate monthly income from a synthetic covered put strategy on TSLA, while providing indirect short exposure to the share price of TSLA. CRSH seeks to benefit when the TSLA share price decreases, however CRSH’s potential corresponding benefit from decreases in the TSLA share price is limited. CRSH seeks to manage potential losses (i.e., cap losses if the TSLA share price experiences significant gains) by purchasing OTM call options. Big income payout. This brand new ETF is only for the very bold, and who are bearish on Tesla stock. It produces a high income level, but declined more than 40% of its price during its first six months in existence. The good news on TSLA: it has more than doubled since last spring. The bad news on TSLA: that giant move brought it back to where it traded about three years ago. I'm no fan of "dead money” (old Wall Street term) especially when it comes in the form of a political football, which was halfway to a meme stock even before the founder ended up in a potentially influential quasi-government position. There's a lot to consider here, and this story is much more complex than a lot of places I can decide to put my money. Knowing that these ETFs exist is step one. Understanding them is step two. Determining how to use them, when to use them and how to avoid getting burned from anything related to Tesla's volatile underlying stock price movement is all part of the "next level" of learning how to design portfolios for modern markets.

Title: Amazon should buy Bitcoin, shareholders say
URL: https://qz.com/amazon-shareholders-add-bitcoin-1851716582
Time Published: 2024-12-09T16:42:04Z
Full Content:
Shareholders of Amazon (AMZN-0.48%) have submitted a proposal to add Bitcoin to the balance sheet. The shareholders of the e-commerce giant are urging the company to learn from MicroStrategy (MSTR+3.28%), which heavily invested in Bitcoin, resulting in an increase in its share price. “MicroStrategy – which holds Bitcoin on its balance sheet – has had its stock outperform Amazon stock by 537% in the previous year,” according to a shareholder proposal shared by conservative think tank the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR). “At minimum, Amazon should evaluate the benefits of holding some, even just 5%, of its assets in Bitcoin,” the proposal added. The proposal comes at a time when shareholders of tech giant Microsoft (MSFT-0.64%) are set to vote on Tuesday on whether to invest in Bitcoin. As of this writing, Bitcoin is currently around $99,000 after surpassing the historic $100,000 milestone. The think tank highlighted several institutional and corporate examples to illustrate why Amazon should consider investing in Bitcoin. It pointed to public companies like Tesla (TSLA+2.79%) and Block (SQ-1.44%), which have already added Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Furthermore, the think tank noted that Amazon’s second and fourth largest institutional shareholders, BlackRock (BLK+1.15%) and Fidelity, have launched Bitcoin ETFs, signaling growing confidence in the cryptocurrency’s potential. Additionally, it suggested that even the U.S. government might establish a Bitcoin strategic reserve as early as 2025, underscoring the increasing mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin as a strategic asset. The think tank emphasized the importance of diversifying Amazon’s holdings, even considering Bitcoin’s volatility. According to the proposal, as of September 30, 2024, Amazon’s total assets amounted to $585 billion, with $88 billion held in cash, cash equivalents, and bonds. “Since cash is consistently being debased and bond yields are lower than the true nation rate, Amazon isn’t adequately protecting billions of dollars of shareholder value simply by holding these assets,” said NCPPR. The think tank argued that Bitcoin outperforms bonds as an investment. As of December 6, 2024, Bitcoin’s price had risen by 131% over the past year, surpassing corporate bonds, which saw an average increase of just 5%, per the proposal. This performance highlights Bitcoin’s potential as a more lucrative alternative to traditional bond investments. Whether or not Amazon decided to add Bitcoin, that’s in the future. However, the way its shareholders have argued in favor of Bitcoin represents how the perception of Bitcoin has changed over the years and how it is getting accepted and becoming more mainstream with each passing day.

Title: Amazon Faces Major Proposal to Invest 5% of Assets in Bitcoin

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. A group of Amazon (AMZN, Financial) shareholders, led by the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), has recommended that Amazon invest at least 5% in bitcoins. The measure interceptor for review ahead of the 2025 AGM will seek to fix the issue caused by Amazon entering the cryptocurrency market, given that Bitcoin has outperformed most assets, including corporate bonds. Interestingly, MicroStrategy (MSTR, Financial), the company that has chosen to integrate Bitcoin as part of its treasury management, had a significantly better score of 537% when compared to Amazon's stock price in the last year. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with AMZN. This proposal has also highlighted the increasing institutional adoption of bitcoins; different stakeholders, such as Amazon's shareholders, BlackRock, and Fidelity, offer bitcoin ETFs to their clients. This is well in tune with the trend of big firms like Tesla and Block incorporating cryptocurrencies in their working capital. The NCPPR thinks that Bitcoin may create inflation protection and increase steadiness in shareholder value with time. Amazon has yet to make a public response to the proposal; however, its board will have to analyze and decide whether or not to propose the change in the proxy statement for the 2025 meeting. The NCPPR's push comes after an attempt to get Microsoft(MSFT, Financial) to include the digital currency on its balance sheet, which was rejected by the shareholders.

Title: Will Amazon Buy Bitcoin? Shareholders Propose 5% Investment
URL: https://bitcoinist.com/will-amazon-buy-bitcoin-shareholders/
Time Published: 2024-12-09T07:00:02Z
Full Content:
Shareholders of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) have submitted a proposal urging the $2.3 trillion technology conglomerate to consider adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet. The measure, submitted by the National Center for Public Policy Research and slated for discussion at Amazon’s 2025 annual shareholder meeting in April, calls on the company’s Board to assess whether incorporating BTC as a treasury asset would serve the best long-term interests of shareholders. In the proposal, shareholders stress that Amazon’s current treasury management may be insufficient in the face of ongoing inflation. As stated in the submission: “Corporations that invest their assets wisely can – and often do – increase shareholder value more than more profitable businesses that don’t.” According to the supporting materials, Amazon’s current treasury includes approximately $88 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, out of a total $585 billion in assets (as of September 30, 2024). The proposal’s authors argue that inflationary pressures and sub-inflationary bond yields are eroding the purchasing power of these holdings. They cite a US Consumer Price Index (CPI) average annual rate of 4.95% over the past four years, at times peaking at 9.1%, while suggesting that “in reality, the true inflation rate is significantly higher.” Against this backdrop, the submission suggests that Amazon has a “fiduciary duty” to consider inflation-resistant assets. The shareholders point to Bitcoin’s historical returns to bolster their case. They note that as of December 6, 2024, BTC price rose 131% over the previous year, outperforming corporate bonds “by 126% on average.” Over a five-year horizon, Bitcoin’s price increased by 1,246%, surpassing corporate bond returns by an estimated 1,242% during that period. “Amazon should – and perhaps has a fiduciary duty to – consider adding assets to its treasury that appreciate more than bonds, even if those assets are more volatile short-term,” the proposal states. The document also references other publicly listed firms that hold BTC. MicroStrategy, one of the earliest corporate adopters, saw its stock outperform Amazon’s by 537% over the previous year, according to the proposal. In addition, institutional players such as BlackRock and Fidelity—both of which hold significant stakes in Amazon—have introduced Bitcoin-focused investment products for their clients. The shareholders further suggest that U.S. government policy could shift toward a “Bitcoin strategic reserve” by 2025, possibly signaling broader mainstream acceptance. “Shareholders request that the Board conduct an assessment to determine if adding Bitcoin to the Company’s treasury is in the best long-term interests of shareholders,” the proposal concludes. This push at Amazon comes on the heels of a similar initiative at Microsoft. As reported by Bitcoinist, Microsoft (MSF) shareholders are set to vote on December 10 on a proposal to include Bitcoin in its treasury as a reserve asset. However, analysts note that the chances of approval are low after the Microsoft Board recommended a “no” vote. At press time, BTC traded at $99,136. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.

Title: 6 Top Undervalued Stocks To Buy In December 2024

getty With one interest rate cut in September and more likely on the way, 2025 could be a standout year for consumer spending. World Data Lab has projected next year's global consumer spending will reach $3.2 trillion. That translates to growth of almost 6%, fueled by 131 million new consumers. If the growth materializes, consumer discretionary stocks—and their shareholders—will benefit. That means it may be time to increase your exposure to the consumer discretionary sector. Even better, you can make the move with one of the potentially undervalued stocks introduced below. I picked the six top undervalued stocks for December by screening on these criteria: Note that these best stock picks are concentrated in one sector, so they are not intended to represent a diversified portfolio. They are presented as options for investors who want to capitalize on falling interest rates in 2025 and the positive effect that trend may have on consumer confidence.

For smaller companies, see our small-cap value stock picks. You may also want to reference our list of value stocks for 2024. Amazon generates revenue from several sources. They include online and store-based retail sales in the U.S. and globally, online advertising, Amazon Prime memberships, logistics and support services for retailers and cloud computing. Since Amazon's third-quarter earnings release, at least 15 analysts have raised their AMZN price targets. The headlining takeaway from the release was 19% quarter-over-quarter growth in the AWS cloud computing business, attributed to strong AI infrastructure demand. AWS is faster-growing and higher-margin than retail sales for Amazon. However, e-commerce, including Prime memberships, still provides most of the company's revenue. Amazon is also the market share leader in U.S. e-commerce sales. Globally, the company accounts for 12% of gross merchandise volume sold online. With that positioning, Amazon should benefit from any measurable uptick in consumer spending. Like Amazon, Alibaba operates a diversified business model that includes e-commerce sales, display advertising, logistics and delivery services and cloud computing. The company is based in China and generates more than half of its revenue from retail e-commerce in its home country. At least five analysts have raised their price targets on Alibaba since the company's last earnings release. Others reiterated their targets and two lowered them. Alibaba also grew its cloud computing revenues, but growth in the company's international digital commerce group was much stronger. Revenues there were up 32% quarter over quarter. The division includes retailers AliExpress and Trendyol plus wholesale site Alibaba.com. One risk to note for Alibaba is the uncertain state of the Chinese economy. Recent stimulus efforts by the Chinese government have helped China's financial markets but consumer confidence remains low. Lululemon produces athletic apparel, footwear and accessories, with an emphasis on technical fabrics and functional designs. The company has deep roots in the yoga community. Products are sold through third-party retailers and directly to consumers via lululemon.com and company-owned stores. Analysts' reactions to Lululemon's last earnings report were mixed, with more target price reductions than increases. While the company beat earnings expectations, it missed on revenue. In 2024, LULU is down 37%. Investors have been worried about rising competition in the luxury athleisure space and the departure of the company's Chief Product Officer Sun Choe. Despite those issues, analysts largely still see upside for the apparel maker, particularly at the lower trading price. If the company can keep its line-up relevant and compelling, it should benefit from increasing consumer confidence next year.

The brand portfolio includes UGG, Hoka, Teva, Koolaburra and ANHU. The products are sold to customers around the world, online and through company-owned retail stores and third-party retailers. Deckers Outdoor has been handily beating analysts' revenue and earnings expectations for several quarters running. The latest earnings release outpaced EPS expectations by more than 28%, prompting several analysts to raise their price targets. DECK stock is up nearly 50% for the year on double-digit revenue gains plus a rising gross margin. Given the five-year EPS growth outlook of 64%, many believe DECK's impressive results will continue in the intermediate term. SharkNinja makes a range of lifestyle products under the Shark and Ninja brand names. Shark products include vacuums and hair styling tools. The Ninja line-up features cookware and small kitchen appliances, such as air fryers and beverage makers. Products are sold online and through third-party retailers. Like Deckers Outdoor, SharkNinja has made a habit of beating expectations recently. Highlights of the company's last earnings release included 33% net sales growth versus the prior-year quarter and a 160-basis-point increase in adjusted gross margin. SharkNinja's success is related in part to its ability to innovate solutions and launch products faster than competitors, according to JPMorgan analysts. The company routinely announces new products and line expansions as it works to optimize the supply chain. Investors like the balance of topline growth with expense control. SN stock is up nearly 80% on the year. Skechers designs, makes and sells footwear, apparel and accessories for men, women and children. The company sells to retailers, marketplaces and directly to consumers (DTC). The DTC channels are skechers.com and a chain of retail stores. In its latest earnings release, Skechers reported 15.9% sales growth and 35.5% diluted EPS growth. The company also raised its full-year revenue and EPS outlook. One negative in the quarter was an 80-basis-point gross margin decline due to lower average selling prices. Despite the raised guidance and several analyst price target increases, SKX stock has not moved much since the late-October release. Given the upside and the generally bullish outlook on the company's five-year earnings outlook, now may be the time to buy. A 2025 uptick in consumer spending could deliver a nice lift to consumer discretionary stocks that already have business momentum. If you are ready to claim your piece of the potential profits, retailers like Amazon and Alibaba plus brand portfolios such as Decker Outdoors and SharkNinja, bought at the right price, could be perfect choices.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks mostly rose on Friday as investors digested the last monthly jobs report of the year, a crucial test of the prospects for interest rate cuts in December and beyond. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) lost about 0.3%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose roughly 0.3%. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) increased 0.8% as Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), and Meta (META) gained, tapping all-time intraday highs. The daily results of the major gauges also reflected their weekly performances. The Dow shed 0.6% for the week, while the S&P 500 gained close to 1%. The Nasdaq climbed more than 3%. The US economy added 227,000 jobs in November, slightly more than expected, as the labor market rebounded from October data that was dinged by severe weather and labor strikes. The unemployment rate unexpectedly ticked up to 4.2%. Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer has all the details here. The report largely matched hopes for a "Goldilocks" reading — strong enough to dampen concerns about the economy but soft enough to keep the Fed's options open on lowering rates this month and into next year. On Friday, markets were pricing in near-90% odds the Fed lowers rates by a quarter percentage point on Dec. 18, per the CME FedWatch Tool, compared with about 70% before the report. Meanwhile, the rally in bitcoin (BTC-USD) continued after slipping, trading around $101,000 Friday afternoon. Options show some investors are hedging against a deeper pullback after the leading token's record-breaking surge to over $100,000 for the first time. The rally has been spurred by hopes of support for digital currencies from President-elect Donald Trump, who on Thursday named former PayPal (PYPL) COO David Sacks as his "White House AI & Crypto Czar." On the corporate front, shares of Lululemon (LULU) and Ulta Beauty (ULTA) jumped after the retailers both boosted profit forecasts. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy US stocks mostly rose on Friday and notched gains for the week as investors took the latest monthly jobs report as a sign that the Fed will likely cut interest rates again later this month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) lost about 0.3%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose roughly 0.3%. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) increased 0.8%, with several tech giants touching new highs. The daily results of the major gauges also reflected their weekly performances. The Dow shed 0.6% for the week, while the S&P 500 gained close to 1%. The Nasdaq climbed more than 3%. If Friday's labor market reading likely kept the Federal Reserve on track to cut interest rates later this month, next week's inflation reading is perhaps the final key data point that could alter that storyline. On Wednesday, a closely watched report on US inflation will give the Federal Reserve another glimpse into consumer prices before they are set to meet for their last policy huddle of the year. If the Consumer Price Index (CPI) surprises to the upside, that might pressure central bankers to halt their interest rate cutting. But as of Friday afternoon, Wall Street largely expects the Fed to cut rates by another quarter percentage. The economic calendar also includes wholesale inventories and the import price index. A handful of major corporate names are set to deliver earnings reports next week. Among the tickers are GameStop (GME), Macy's (M), Costco (COST), and Broadcom (AVGO). Yahoo Finance's Brent Sanchez has a graphical breakdown of what to watch next week: TikTok's loss is Meta (META)'s gain. Shares of Facebook's parent company rose nearly 3% Friday afternoon following a US appeals court decision that upheld a law banning TikTok from operating in the US under Chinese ownership. The decision, which could be overturned by the Supreme Court, increases the likelihood that the short-form video app will be banned in the US. That would seriously diminish a rising competitor to American social media and digital advertising platforms. The stocks of several US tech giants rose on the news. Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), the corporate parent of Google and YouTube, gained 1%. TikTok's future isn't set, however. In addition to the legal challenges that ByteDance could pursue, there is also the unknown of what resident-elect Trump could do. As Yahoo Finance's Alexis Keenan reports, his statements on the campaign trail suggest he may at least try to tinker with the impact of the law. Here are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance’s trending tickers page during afternoon trading on Friday: Lululemon (LULU): Shares of the athletic apparel company soared Friday afternoon on the back of strong third quarter results. Lululemon raised its full-year revenue forecast after beating estimates across the top and bottom line, thanks in large part to the brand's strength in international markets. Palantir (PLTR): The big data analytics company rose more than 5% Friday after signing a new AI partnership with defense contractor Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH). Palantir is up more than 300% so far this year, riding the momentum of advancements in AI technology. Shopify (SHOP): Shares of the e-commerce platform gained 5% Friday following an upgrade from Loop Capital from a Hold to a Buy, nodding to the company's use of AI. Loop raised its price target to $140, reflecting a 23% potential upside to the stock. Ulta Beauty (ULTA): The cosmetic store chain is rallying after the company beat third quarter earnings estimates Thursday and as executives raised their forecasts for full-year earnings. Net sales for the quarter increased by 1.7% to $2.5 billion. Shares rose 10% Friday afternoon. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) shot up above $101,000 at around 1:10 p.m. ET on Friday after falling below the $100,000 milestone level. On Thursday evening President-elect Donald Trump announced venture capitalist David Sacks will be his incoming administration's "AI and crypto czar." Bitcoin reached new highs late Wednesday, surpassing $100,000 for the first time following Trump’s nomination of Paul Atkins to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission. Atkins is seen as a crypto-friendly pick for the position. The token cleared $103,000 after Trump took to his social media platform Truth Social early Thursday to cheer the recent all-time highs, telling crypto enthusiasts that they are welcome for the rally that has followed his election win last month. "CONGRATULATIONS BITCOINERS!!! $100,000!!! YOU'RE WELCOME!!!" Trump wrote. "Together, we will Make America Great Again!" A jobs report that largely matched hopes for a "Goldilocks" reading sent stocks higher in afternoon trading Friday as investors digested a crucial test of the prospects for interest rate cuts in December and beyond. Several Big Tech names also hit intraday highs, including Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), and Meta (META). The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was the outlier among the major indexes, shedding about 0.1%. But the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.2% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) increased roughly 0.6%. A US federal appeals court upheld a new law that outlaws TikTok from operating in the US under Chinese ownership, reports Yahoo Finance's Alexis Keenan. The plan could still be altered by the Supreme Court or affected by President-elect Donald Trump, who in September suggested in a social media post that he would "save TikTok" and prevent federal law enforcement from shuttering the app. The law, called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (PAFACAA), gives TikTok’s Chinese owner, ByteDance, an ultimatum to either sell TikTok to a US owner by Jan. 19, 2025, or have it banned from operations in the country. TikTok challenged the law by arguing it violated the US Constitution in taking away the First Amendment rights of TikTok's US entity and its users. But a panel of three judges from the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit concluded that the government's law withstood constitutional scrutiny by protecting free speech in the US "from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary's ability to gather data on people in the United States."

A labor market rebound announced Friday is likely to keep the Federal Reserve on track to cut interest rates by another quarter percentage point later this month, absent any upside surprises to inflation, reports Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger. "For the Fed, this doesn't change the narrative," Robert Sockin, Citigroup's senior chief economist, told Yahoo Finance. The new jobs numbers are "right in the spot of what they were looking for and they are comfortable with to continue easing policy" at the last meeting of the year, on Dec. 17-18. Traders boosted the odds of a rate cut at that meeting to 91% following the data release. But Fed watchers agreed that the robust jobs picture and recent stickiness in inflation reinforce a mounting conviction that the pace of rate cuts in 2025 will be less aggressive than once expected. Read about how the latest labor market readings will steer the Federal Reserve's next policy decision here. Consumers are growing more concerned about the path forward for inflation over the next year. The latest consumer sentiment survey from the University of Michigan revealed that consumers expect inflation to hit 2.9% in a year, an increase from last month's expectation of 2.6%. December's reading is the highest in six months but within the 2.3% to 3% range seen in the two years before the pandemic. Expectations for long-run inflation slipped higher, though, falling to 3.1% from 3.2% the month prior. The overall consumer sentiment index popped to a reading of 74, up from 71.8 in November. Overall, consumer views on inflation varied based on political party, Surveys of Consumers Director Joanne Hsu noted. "Democrats voiced concerns that anticipated policy changes, particularly tariff hikes, would lead to a resurgence in inflation," Hsu said in the release. "Republicans disagreed; they expect the next president will usher in an immense slowdown in inflation." Also in this month's data, the survey showed a large increase in buying conditions for durable goods, which boosted current economic conditions by more than 20%. "Rather than a sign of strength, this rise in durables was primarily due to a perception that purchasing durables now would enable buyers to avoid future price increases," Hsu said. A jobs report that largely matched hopes for a "Goldilocks" reading sent stocks higher as investors digested a crucial test of the prospects for interest rate cuts in December and beyond. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained about 0.3% and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.2% after the gauges drifted away from all-time highs at Thursday's close. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) increased roughly 0.3%. The US economy added 227,000 jobs in November, slightly more than expected, as the labor market rebounded from October data that was dinged by severe weather and labor strikes. The unemployment rate unexpectedly ticked up to 4.2%. The US labor market rebounded from an October swoon, adding more jobs than expected in November, while the unemployment rate ticked higher to 4.2%.
