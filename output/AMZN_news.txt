Earnings season continues this week, with notable economic releases for inflation and consumer ... [+] spending. However, with President Trump threatening reciprocal tariffs, fundamental data could take a backseat to politics. With almost two-thirds of the fourth-quarter earnings season complete, the pace slows slightly with 77 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report. Seventy-seven percent of S&P 500 firms reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter. Two of the Magnificent 7 reported earnings last week, with only Nvidia (NVDA) remaining on February 26. The Magnificent 7 consists of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Tesla (TSLA). S&P 500 Earnings Season Despite robust earnings growth and a noisy but solid jobs report, concerns about President Donald Trump’s threatened additional tariffs and some worries about artificial intelligence spending caused some market consternation. The S&P 500 fell 0.2% for the week, but the Magnificent 7 lost 2.8%. Market Returns According to FactSet data, industrials, consumer discretionary, and healthcare contributed most significantly to last week's earnings growth improvement, while the industrials sector was the largest detractor. Uber Technologies (UBER) was the most significant contributor to industrials, with Amazon.com (AMZN) being the most critical contributor to the consumer discretionary sector. Within healthcare, earnings beats by Pfizer (PFE) and Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) increased the earnings growth rate. The financial sector is expected to show the most rapid year-over-year growth rate in the S&P 500, followed by communications services and consumer discretionary. The energy sector is at the bottom, with a forecasted almost twenty-eight percent decline in year-over-year earnings. Estimated Earnings By Sector Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. At this point in the earnings season, sales growth at 5.2% exceeds expectations, with the tailwind from 5% year-over-year nominal GDP growth. Estimated Sales By Sales Due primarily to the robust earnings growth for financials, communication services, and consumer discretionary, the blended earnings performance has significantly outperformed expectations at the end of the quarter. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at +16.4% year-over-year, above the expectation of +11.9% at the end of the quarter. S&P 500 Earnings Summary Because these companies are a critical driver of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 are the group to watch this earnings season. Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) reported last week. While earnings growth was robust for both, it was below very high expectations, and the stocks were sent lower for the week. Separately, investors are questioning whether both companies' increased AI infrastructure spending will yield a good return on investment. Looking at Alphabet specifically, their cloud business revenue, including AI infrastructure demand, grew by 30% year-over-year, but that slowed from the 35% growth in the previous quarter. Notably, the company said capacity constraints, not demand, were the issue. The company expects to spend about $75 billion in 2025 on additional AI infrastructure, an increase of 43% over 2024. Aside from focusing on AI, Alphabet’s core businesses, search and YouTube, performed well in the quarter. Nvidia (NVDA) is the final group member to report earnings, scheduled for February 26. The introduction of DeepSeek led to worries that demand for their AI chips might falter, so the stock had been down over 20% from its peak until last week’s 8% rally. Alphabet and Amazon announced significant increases in capital spending to meet AI capacity demands, which helped reduce worries that a decline in demand for NVIDIA’s chipsets could be imminent. Notable companies reporting this week are McDonald’s (MCD), Coca-Cola (KO), Humana (HUM), Kraft Heinz (KHC), Applied Materials (AMAT), and Airbnb (ABNB). Magnificent 7: Q4 Earnings Growth It was a noisy monthly jobs report on Friday. Non-farm payrolls grew by 143,000 in January, which was below consensus. More recent months were revised higher but offset by downward revisions to farther out months. Both household employment measures are distorted by a much higher than typical adjustment for immigration-related adjustments. These adjustments also helped send the unemployment rate down to 4%. The workweek fell to a 5-year low of 34.1 hours, and hourly earnings rose more than expected. Though the government said that the numbers showed no impact from the L.A. fires and weather conditions, it seems likely that there was an impact, so it's best to take this month’s job data with a grain of salt. Monthly Job Growth Looking at other labor market data for some clarity, initial claims for unemployment benefits remain low, so there is no sign of a collapse in the job market. Initial Jobless Claims Given the mixed and noisy monthly jobs report, markets and the Federal Reserve (Fed) will wait for more straightforward data to make any decisions about the economy. The Fed is expected to be on the sidelines until mid-year when it might resume short-term interest rate cuts. Regarding the U.S. economy, the crucial releases will be Wednesday’s consumer inflation (CPI) and Friday’s retail sales numbers. CPI is expected to hold steady at an above-target 2.9% rate, but the details will be more critical with housing costs and services inflation closely watched. Retail sales are expected to slow from December’s rapid pace, but the U.S. consumer is the lifeblood of the economy. U.S. CPI Inflation Estimate Earnings season slows, but plenty of important companies are reporting this week. Fundamental data could take a backseat to politics. President Trump announced he would roll out reciprocal tariffs this week to match the levies other countries put on U.S. imports. Markets would probably see these as positive relative to the original thought of a 10% to 20% global tariff, but it would almost certainly add the European Union to the targeted regions. The duration of the higher tariffs, retaliatory action by impacted countries, the strength of the U.S. dollar, and the ability to switch to domestically produced or imports from non-impacted countries will impact any price increases or demand shocks caused by the tariffs, so the ultimate result is impossible to know. In any case, markets dislike uncertainty, so tariff news should add to volatility. Disclosure: Glenview Trust holds many stocks mentioned in this article within its recommended investment strategies.

Title: What's Happening With AMZN Stock?

LAS VEGAS, USA - JANUARY 09: Logo of Amazon seen during the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2025 in ... [+] Las Vegas, Nevada, on January 9, 2025. (Photo by Artur Widak/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) surpassed street expectations from its fourth quarter performance, delivering revenue of $187.8 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $1.86 - topping analysts’ projections of $187.3 billion and $1.49, respectively. While Amazon Web Services remained a key growth driver, the company provided a cautious first-quarter forecast that could potentially pressure its stock price in the near term. Separately, after a good fourth quarter should you Buy, Sell, Or Hold LLY Stock At $870? AMZN stock, with 57% returns since the beginning of 2024, has outperformed the S&P 500 index, up 28%. The company’s substantial investments in rebuilding its infrastructure over recent years are now yielding results, which is evident from the improvement in operating profits. This has boded well for its stock. But, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. Amazon’s revenue of $187.8 billion in Q4 reflected a 10% y-o-y growth. Looking at segments, North America saw a 10% rise to $115.6 billion, International sales were up 8% to $43.4 billion, and AWS saw a 19% jump to $28.8 billion. Amazon also saw its operating margin expand by 350 bps y-o-y to 11.3% in Q4, thanks to an uptick in its high-margin AWS business. Higher revenues clubbed with margin expansion resulted in the bottom line of $1.86, up 86% y-o-y. Amazon’s first-quarter revenue guidance ranges between $151 billion and $155.5 billion, falling short of analysts’ expectations of $158.5 billion. This forecast includes an anticipated negative impact of $2.1 billion from unfavorable foreign exchange movements. Furthermore, the company raised its capital expenditures to $100 billion this year, reflecting its continued investments in AI. Amazon is focused on expanding its infrastructure to keep pace with the surging demand for generative AI services. Although Amazon posted an upbeat Q4, its stock is trading lower in after-hour trading amid a bleak Q1 outlook. Even if we look at a slightly longer period, the increase in AMZN stock over the last four-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last four-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts, impending tariff wars, and the rise of DeepSeek, could AMZN face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months — or will it see a strong jump? While we will soon update our model for Amazon, to reflect the latest results, we think its stock has little room for growth. At its current levels of around $230, AMZN is already trading at 3.9x trailing revenues, versus the stock’s average P/S ratio of 3.2x over the last five years. Investors have awarded Amazon a premium to its historical valuation multiple, reflecting the company’s enhanced profitability. In light of Amazon’s recent performance and future outlook, we see limited opportunity for its valuation multiple to expand further. Also, check out our note on What’s Happening With GOOG Stock? While AMZN stock looks like it has little room for growth, it is helpful to see how Amazon’s Peers fare on metrics that matter.

Title: Amazon wants to spend $104 billion, and the stock gets clipped: What Wall Street is saying

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Amazing what some foreign-exchange fluctuations and eye-popping capital expenditures guidance will do to a large-cap tech stock. Amazon stock (AMZN) was clipped by 3% to $231.80 each in premarket trading on Friday after the tech giant delivered mixed first quarter guidance and promised big spending on AI infrastructure in 2025. The company's ticker page was the most active on the Yahoo Finance platform, ahead of retail investor favorite Palantir (PLTR), which has been on a post-earnings tear this week. Amazon guided to first quarter revenue of between $151 billion and $155 billion. Analysts were anticipating $158 billion, with the miss the function of a $2.1 billion expected hit from currency fluctuations. Similar to Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) this earnings season, Amazon uncorked a whopper of a capital spending guide. It sees $104 billion in capital expenditures this year, well above analyst forecasts of $80 billion to $85 billion. The Street has opted to stay bullish on Amazon after its results for two reasons, however. Most analysts have pointed to a sales reacceleration in the key Amazon Web Services cloud business later this year, amid the company's aggressive spending. Watch: How Salesforce's CEO is planning for the AI future "The shares have pulled back on the guidance and the fact that 2025 is likely an investment year, but we expect by second half 2025 this heavy capex investment + accelerating AI adoption (which we believe will also accelerate the move to the cloud) should begin to materially re-accelerate cloud revenue," Pivotal Research analyst Jeffrey Wlodarczak said in a client note. The other factor is that Amazon just had a good quarter. What stood out to Yahoo Finance: Three straight quarters of 19% sales growth for AWS. AWS operating profit margin of 46.9%, versus 29.6% a year ago. The second consecutive quarter of accelerated sales growth at Amazon's physical stores. Amazon delivered its highest quarterly operating income ever at $21.2 billion. Here are several of the best Wall Street insights on Amazon's quarter and outlook. Rating: Buy/Reiterated Price Target: $260/Reiterated "Amazon has a deep moat around their core businesses driven by their unmatched scale and appears to have numerous healthy organic revenue growth opportunities driven primarily by their high margin AWS cloud segment (which we expect to grow from 17% of revenue to ~35% in 5 years), extension of their e-commerce/fulfillment arms into new segments/internationally, continued rapid growth in their advertising business [already #3 in the world behind GOOG (BUY) and META (BUY)] and proven ability to develop new successful products/revenue streams leveraging their massive scale. This is all enhanced by what we believe is the potential to materially boost operating margins driven by scale, leveraging robotics/AI and benefits from an increasing % of revenue from high margin cloud computing/advertising combined with what appears to be an attractive valuation. AMZN remains on track at AWS and appears ahead of schedule on better monetization in its core retail/advertising/subscription businesses." Rating: Buy/Reiterated Price Target: $280/Previous: $235 "Commentary from management suggested that AWS is healthy with adoption across their services, whether they be AI-related or non-AI. Furthermore, it was noted that while it wasn't a huge impact, once AWS becomes less capacity constrained, they expect they'll be able to accelerate growth even more which they expect to occur in the back half of the year. We continue to believe that AWS is the best positioned of the three hyperscalers, as conversations with our DEN experts indicate that Amazon has quickly caught up and now surpassed Azure in AI-related services." Rating: Overweight/Reiterated Price Target: $270/Reiterated "Amazon views GenAI as the largest opportunity since cloud and the biggest tech shift since the Internet, w/virtually every app likely to infuse GenAI and most companies utilizing agents over time. Amazon views the $26.3B capex in 4Q as a reasonable representation of its 2025 capital investment rate, translating to about $105 billion in 2025 annual capex. The majority of spend will support growing need for tech infrastructure for demand across AI services, along w/support for North America and International. Amazon noted it only procures infrastructure given strong demand signals, which we view as bullish for AWS’ multi-year growth trajectory. In light of DeepSeek, CEO Andy Jassy believes the cost of inference will substantially come down over time. However, similar to cloud, where AWS cut prices 134 times between 2006-2023, Amazon believes lower inference costs will increase customers’ total spending as customers infuse applications w/inference and GenAI (i.e. Jevons Paradox). Like for Meta (META) and Alphabet (GOOG), heavy infrastructure investment should be a competitive advantage, and we believe the spending bodes well for multiple years of strong AWS revenue growth." Rating: Outperform/Reiterated Price Target: $280/Reiterated "We reiterate our Outperform rating and $280 price target and highlight possible catalysts in the intermediate-term, including (1) growing AI contributions to AWS growth as capacity constraints abate beginning in 2H25, (2) more meaningful improvements in cost to serve driven by deeper automation and robotics, (3) commercialization of AI capabilities in Alexa, (4) monetization of Project Kuiper which could begin late this year or in 1H26, and (5) an expected increase in Prime Subscription prices early next year."

Title: Temu and Shein's strategy to beat Trump's tariffs
URL: https://qz.com/temu-shein-amazon-trump-tariffs-china-retail-shipments-1851756879
Time Published: 2025-02-06T16:27:00Z
Full Content:
Chinese e-commerce giants Temu and Shein have been preparing to maintain their U.S. customer base following the end of the de minimis exemption. This rule, which allowed goods worth less than $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free, has played a key role in their rapid growth in the American market. But with President Donald Trump’s recent decision to suspend the provision, both companies are stepping up efforts to navigate new tariffs and customs rules. To reduce the impact of the changes, Temu has increased its focus on promoting items stored in U.S. warehouses, allowing it to bypass the tariffs that would have affected direct shipments from China. Shein has adopted a similar strategy, using warehouses in states like California and New Jersey. While this strategy may help them compete with Amazon, it also means both companies are working with less inventory. However, focusing on local inventory allows them to speed up delivery times – a critical advantage in the crowded e-commerce space. This has already paid off for Temu, with a significant portion of U.S. sales now coming from U.S.-based sellers. Temu had been exploring faster delivery options from local sellers even before the tariffs. Amazon (AMZN+2.02%), however, still leads the way in same-day and next-day delivery, with over nine billion items delivered in 2024. Shein, which has already been localizing its operations, has expanded its U.S. distribution centers. This shift enables Shein to fulfill orders from local stock, reducing its reliance on cross-border shipments while easing the impact of tariffs. The move also cuts down on delivery wait times, potentially boosting sales. However, Shein’s U.S. IPO plans are now uncertain as the company faces challenges, including concerns over its labor practices, which have delayed its public debut. The uncertainty surrounding cross-border shipments grew when the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) briefly stopped accepting packages from China, throwing a wrench in operations for companies like Temu and Amazon. The Postal Service quickly reversed course, allowing packages to be accepted once again. Still, the episode highlighted the volatility that Chinese e-commerce firms face as they navigate shifting customs requirements. For now, Temu and Shein’s strategies to go local signal that both companies have been preparing for these regulatory shifts and are taking steps to soften the impact. While critics argue that the de minimis exemption gave Chinese companies an unfair advantage, experts believe both Temu and Shein will continue to thrive. Santa Clara University Professor Kirthi Kalyanam told Business Insider that Shein’s success is driven by its manufacturing model, not its reliance on de minimis shipments. While the “tightening” of de minimis may remove any price advantage, Kalyanam believes Shein’s core strengths will remain intact.
