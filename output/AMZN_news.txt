ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Costco (NASDAQ: COST) completed fiscal 2025 (August fiscal year) with a solid quarter, slightly surpassing expectations and highlighting the strengths that distinguish it. Its Q4 earnings of $5.87 per share, a rise of 11% year-over-year, on $86.2 billion in revenue, an increase of 8%, exceeded forecasts. U.S. comparable sales increased by 5.1%, outpacing Walmart’s (NYSE: WMT) 4.6% and significantly surpassing Target’s (NYSE: TGT) 1.9% decline, underscoring the attractiveness of the warehouse model and indicating resilient traffic and consistent member spending. However, U.S. comp sales have gradually weakened—from 8.3% in Q2 to 6.6% in Q3 and 5.1% in Q4—suggesting a slowdown in domestic growth. COST shares have increased by roughly 180% over five years but have underperformed the market this year, rising only 3% against the S&P 500’s 12% increase. Also see, Buy or Sell Costco Stock? Digital growth was particularly notable in Q4: e-commerce sales rose by 13.6%, broadening Costco’s reach beyond its physical stores. Membership income—the high-margin profit generator—increased by 14% to $1.7 billion, highlighting the stickiness of its subscription model. At first glance, it presents a retail dream. But here’s the caveat. Costco is trading at 52x earnings and 57x free cash flow, indicating a meager 1.8% cash flow yield. For comparison, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), which exhibits more rapid top-line growth and has exposure to high-margin areas such as cloud and advertising, trades at a lower multiple. Costco may possess scale, strategy, and market favor—but it carries a high price tag. Even with a solid Q4, escalating costs due to inflation, tariffs, and labor suggest that investors may focus more on Costco’s future outlook than on the quarterly results. Unlike many of its competitors, the company does not provide a full-year forecast, making the stock more responsive to any forward-looking commentary. Additionally, check Qualcomm Stock To 2x? Costco is priced for perfection, and even minor slowdowns can lead to turbulence. For context, this stock is not immune to volatility. Shares fell nearly 49% during the 2008 financial crisis, 20% during the early 2020 Covid-19 panic, and 32% in the inflation-driven decline of 2022. Investors should consider this historical context, even as the current fundamentals appear robust. For those seeking lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio offers an alternative—having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Costco’s valuation relies on consistent performance. Over the last three years, annual top-line growth averaged 7.3%. In the past twelve months, revenues increased by 8.1% to $275 billion. Operating income was around $10 billion, with an operating margin of 3.8% and a cash flow margin of 4.6%, generating nearly $12 billion in operating cash flow. Net income reached $8 billion, yielding a net margin of 2.9%, demonstrating Costco’s proficiency in converting growth into profitability. Recurring membership revenue, characterized by high margins, has proven particularly resilient. Last autumn, Costco raised membership fees for the first time since 2017, adding $5 or $10 for higher-tier members without negatively impacting retention. Costco operates 914 warehouses globally, including 629 in the U.S., maintaining its pricing advantage through razor-thin margins and the effectiveness of Kirkland Signature (Costco’s exclusive private label brand). In Q4, shopping frequency increased by 3.7%, while the average ticket rose by 2.6%, indicating that growth is driven by traffic rather than price. Its flexible supply chain reduces risks from tariffs and global sourcing. Two-thirds of merchandise is procured domestically. Localizing Kirkland production and the steady demand for essentials such as groceries and gas further diminish risk. Scale enhances pricing power, a crucial factor in maintaining its premium valuation. Costco continues to be a top-tier operator, but its high valuation may not align with fundamentals. Revenue growth is solid but not extraordinary. The pace of store expansion is slowing, and some new locations might cannibalize existing sales. The premium assumes sustained elevated growth. If comparable sales keep decelerating, investor confidence—and Costco’s valuation multiple—could be under pressure. Investing in a single stock carries inherent risks. You could look into the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to deliver strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive approach to maximize the benefits of favorable market conditions while minimizing losses during downturns, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.
