ByJason Kirsch, Contributor. Income-seeking investors continue hunting for yield in a market where traditional dividend stocks often fall short of expectations. Enter YieldMax ETFs—a unique breed of exchange-traded funds that use sophisticated options strategies to generate monthly distributions from high-profile growth stocks that typically don't pay dividends. These innovative funds have captured significant investor attention by promising attractive yields from companies like Tesla, Netflix and Meta. But with dozens of YieldMax offerings now available, selecting the right ones requires careful analysis of performance metrics, volatility patterns and income sustainability. This article examines five top YieldMax ETFs that deserve consideration for income-focused portfolios. YieldMax ETFs represent a specialized category of funds that seek to generate monthly income by pursuing options-based strategies on one or more underlying securities, without actually owning the underlying stocks. Instead of relying on traditional dividend payments, these funds employ synthetic covered call strategies combined with U.S. Treasury holdings to create income streams from volatile growth stocks. The strategy works by selling call options against positions that mirror the performance of popular stocks like Tesla or Amazon. When these options expire worthless or at lower values, the premiums collected become distributable income for shareholders. However, this approach comes with trade-offs—investors sacrifice unlimited upside potential in exchange for regular monthly distributions. YieldMax ETFs are designed to deliver an alternative source of income for dividend-seeking investors through a covered-call strategy, making them particularly appealing during periods when traditional income investments underperform. After analyzing performance data, asset size, yield sustainability and underlying security volatility, five YieldMax ETFs stand out as the most compelling options for income investors. This evaluation focused on funds with substantial assets under management, consistent distribution histories, and exposure to fundamentally strong underlying companies that generate sufficient option premiums. The selected funds represent different risk-reward profiles while maintaining YieldMax's core income-generation approach. Some offer more conservative yields with steadier performance, while others provide extreme income potential with correspondingly higher volatility. CONY has emerged as YieldMax's flagship fund with $1.4 billion in assets under management, making it the most extensive offering in the family. The fund targets Coinbase (COIN), capitalizing on the cryptocurrency exchange's notorious volatility to generate exceptional option premiums. With a staggering 127.73% forward yield, CONY offers income potential that dwarfs virtually all other investment options, though this comes with corresponding risks tied to crypto market fluctuations. Despite Coinbase's volatile nature, CONY has demonstrated relative stability in 2025 with a modest 1.4% year-to-date return. This performance suggests the fund's income strategy has successfully cushioned against some of the underlying stock's price swings, though investors should remember that crypto-related investments remain inherently unpredictable. The fund's substantial asset base indicates strong investor confidence and provides operational advantages through economies of scale. CONY's appeal lies in its ability to transform Coinbase's high implied volatility into consistent monthly income. While the triple-digit yield might seem unsustainable, it reflects the premium investors receive for accepting capped upside participation in one of the market's most volatile sectors. For income investors comfortable with crypto exposure, CONY represents an intriguing way to monetize volatility rather than simply enduring it. TSLY commands significant attention with $1.09 billion in assets under management, making it the second-largest YieldMax fund. The ETF focuses on Tesla (TSLA), one of the most actively traded and volatile stocks in the market. While Tesla's stock price movements have challenged the fund in 2025, resulting in a -19.5% year-to-date decline, TSLY continues generating substantial income with a 45.65% forward yield that provides meaningful compensation for price volatility. Tesla's position as an electric vehicle pioneer and its expansion into energy storage, autonomous driving and artificial intelligence create ongoing option premium opportunities. The stock's high implied volatility stems from its sensitivity to production updates, regulatory changes and CEO Elon Musk's public statements. This volatility, while creating principal risk, also generates the option premiums that fuel TSLY's distributions. Despite recent underperformance, TSLY remains relevant for investors seeking exposure to the electric vehicle revolution while generating monthly income. Tesla's long-term growth prospects in multiple high-growth sectors suggest that periods of volatility present opportunities rather than permanent impairments. For investors willing to accept Tesla's inherent unpredictability, TSLY offers a way to collect income while maintaining exposure to one of the market's most innovative companies. NFLY has delivered impressive performance in 2025, posting a 27.1% year-to-date return while maintaining a respectable 29.97% forward yield. The fund capitalizes on Netflix's position as a streaming industry leader, benefiting from the company's global expansion, content investment cycles, and subscriber growth announcements. Netflix's stock typically exhibits significant reactions to quarterly earnings reports and subscriber metrics, creating attractive option-writing opportunities. The streaming giant's volatility patterns make it well-suited for covered call strategies. Netflix often experiences sharp moves following earnings releases or major content announcements, allowing NFLY to capture premium from these price swings. The company's transition from a growth-focused model to one emphasizing profitability and free cash flow has created more predictable business patterns while maintaining enough volatility to support option strategies. NFLY's $176 million in assets under management, while smaller than CONY and TSLY, represents solid investor interest in the streaming sector's income potential. The fund offers exposure to the digital entertainment revolution while generating monthly distributions from an industry leader. For investors seeking balanced exposure to technology growth with meaningful income generation, NFLY presents an attractive middle ground between conservative and aggressive YieldMax offerings. AMZY targets Amazon (AMZN), providing income investors access to one of the world's most dominant technology companies while generating a substantial 50.45% forward yield. Amazon's diverse business model spanning e-commerce, cloud computing, advertising and logistics creates multiple volatility drivers that support robust option premiums. The fund posted a solid 6.6% year-to-date return, demonstrating resilience despite broader market uncertainties. Amazon Web Services continues driving significant profit margins while the company's e-commerce operations benefit from ongoing digital transformation trends. The stock's sensitivity to cloud growth metrics, earnings surprises and macroeconomic factors creates regular option premium opportunities. AMZY's $282 million in assets reflects growing recognition of Amazon's suitability for income-generating strategies. The fund's appeal extends beyond its impressive yield to include exposure to Amazon's long-term secular growth themes. Cloud computing, artificial intelligence and digital advertising represent multi-trillion-dollar markets where Amazon maintains leading positions. AMZY allows investors to participate in these growth trends while receiving substantial monthly distributions, creating a compelling combination for those seeking both income and growth potential from a single investment. FBY focuses on Meta Platforms (META), delivering strong 2025 performance with a 16.1% year-to-date return alongside a 34.06% forward yield. Meta's transformation from a social media company to a "metaverse" and artificial intelligence leader has created significant stock volatility, particularly around quarterly earnings and major product announcements. This volatility provides excellent raw material for FBY's covered call strategy. Meta's substantial investments in virtual reality, augmented reality and AI infrastructure create ongoing uncertainty about future profitability timelines, leading to stock price fluctuations that benefit option strategies. The company's core advertising business remains highly profitable, providing fundamental support while newer initiatives drive volatility. FBY's $177 million in assets indicates solid investor interest in monetizing Meta's transformation story. The fund offers exposure to next-generation computing platforms while generating meaningful monthly income from one of technology's most ambitious companies. Meta's position in social media, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence ensures continued relevance in the global technology landscape. FBY presents an opportunity to participate in the potential metaverse revolution while collecting substantial distributions during the uncertain transition period. Bottom Line YieldMax ETFs offer income investors a unique approach to generating monthly distributions from growth stocks that traditionally don't pay dividends. The five funds highlighted—CONY, TSLY, NFLY, AMZY, and FBY—represent the most established and liquid options in this specialized category, each offering different risk-reward profiles through exposure to leading technology and innovation companies. While these funds can generate impressive yields ranging from 30% to over 120%, investors must understand that high income comes with trade-offs, including capped upside participation and significant volatility risk. For income-focused investors comfortable with these dynamics, YieldMax ETFs provide an innovative way to harvest yield from some of the market's most dynamic companies.
