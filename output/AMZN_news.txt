Amazon's third-quarter earnings beat estimates and it gave strong guidance for the current quarter on Thursday, sending shares up after the closing bell. Net sales for Q3 hit $158.9 billion, outperforming the consensus analyst estimate of $157.3 billion, and Amazon also forecast sales for its current quarter of $181.5 billion to $188.5 billion, compared to an estimated $186.36 billion. The tech titan beat on EPS, too. Big Tech companies have come under increasing scrutiny recently to demonstrate that the billions of dollars they've been spending over the last few years on AI infrastructure are starting to deliver returns. During the investor call, CEO Jassy said Amazon plans to spend over $75 billion in 2025, the majority in its key AWS cloud computing unit. Jassy said the increase is driven by generative AI and that customers and shareholders will feel good about it in the long term. AI "is a really unusually large, maybe once-in-a-lifetime type of opportunity," he said. On the retail side, Amazon's CFO Brian Olsavsky said that "Prime remains a core contributor" to growth this year. Paid membership growth in the US and internationally continued to rise in the third quarter, he said, helped by Prime Day events in July. While the company didn't really comment on the state of the US consumer, Olsavsky said Amazon's "faster delivery speeds" are helping fuel growth in purchases of everyday items. Amazon's stock climbed as much as 6% in volatile after-hours trading shortly after the results. Despite a sharp 3.3% drop during regular trading on Thursday, the stock is still up 23% so far in 2024. Jassy didn't say much about the state of the consumer, but he did say Amazon's "speed of delivery" offers significant advantages to customers. "The faster that we're able to promise customers that we can get them their items, the more frequently they buy," Jassy said. "And then more they actually use Amazon for their shopping needs." Amazon said some consumers are trading down and orders of everyday essentials are growing. Those everyday essentials "are really predicated on speed." he said. Amazon gave a peek at its key capex plans. It expects to spend about $75 billion in 2024 and more than that in 2025. Jassy the said majority of that spending in 2025 will be for AWS. "The increased bumps here are really driven by generative AI, as I was mentioning my own opening comments," Jassy said. Jassy said that AI "is a really unusually large, maybe once in a lifetime type of opportunity," but "customers, the business and our shareholders will feel good about this long term." "I think we've proven over time, that we can drive enough operating income and free cash flow to make this a very successful return on invested capital business," Jassy said. "And we expect the same thing will happen here with generative AI." Paid membership growth accelerated in the third quarter in the US and internationally, Amazon CFO Brian T. Olsavsky said in the call. As of March, the share of US consumers who have Amazon Prime was about 75%, Bloomberg reported. Jassy said new Kindle sales "significantly outperformed" expectations. "Kindle is having an excellent year with customers reading more than ever," Jassy said. "We now have over 20 billion average monthly pages read on Kindle devices worldwide." Amazon's AI business is a "multi billion dollar business that's growing triple digit percentages year over year," Jassy says. It's "growing three times faster at its stage of evolution than AWS did itself." Jassy also says that while the company has a "deep partnership" with Nvidia, customers want better price performance for AI workloads. Jassy says the company is seeing "significant interest" in its custom silicon chips. Jassy mentions a number of its own AI offerings including the expansion of Amazon's shopping assistant Rufus, AI shopping guides, and Project Amelia. "We're seeing meaningful growth in a very large base," Jassy said. "We see further opportunity in driving even better performance for advertisers, further improving the relevancy of the ads we show, and by providing additional optimization controls." Amazon's head of IR kicks off the call before handing it over to Andy Jassy, who recaps the earnings report. "As always, we're focused on making our customers' lives better and easier and thinking long-term with respect to how we can keep helping customers and build a successful business," Jassy said. Truist Securities said in a note to investors that Amazon is expected to discuss four key topics during the call: the health of the consumer leading up to the holidays, AWS headed into the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2025, North America and international operating margins, and management's thoughts on capital expenditures heading into 2025. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy highlighted the company's October Prime Days in the report. "We kicked off the holiday season with our biggest-ever Prime Big Deal Days and the launch of an all-new Kindle lineup that is significantly outperforming our expectations," he said, saying the company is excited about what's in store for customers during the key holiday shopping period. "Amazon continues to be the primary beneficiary of the US consumer's shift to online shopping and a healthy Prime Day helped boost revenues for the retail and ad businesses," EMARKETER analyst Canaves said. He also said Amazon would share information about "over 100 new cloud infrastructure and AI capabilities" at an AWS re:Invent event the week after Thanksgiving. EMARKETER principal analyst Sky Canaves told BI Amazon beat expectations "on the strength of the three pillars of its business: ecommerce, advertising, and cloud services." While Amazon has had to increase AI-related spending, Canaves said it is in a good spot since it has been steadily growing "AWS capacity and faces fewer constraints." 3rd quarter Net sales: $158.88 billion, +11% y/y, estimate $157.29 billion Operating income: $17.41 billion, +56% y/y, estimate $14.75 billion 4th quarter Source: Bloomberg Amazon fell as much as 3.9% on Thursday and was trading 3.5% lower as of 3:25 p.m. in New York. Morgan Stanley suggested that investors stick with Amazon, even if the firm's fourth-quarter guidance might disappoint. Analysts led by Brian Nowak suggested that the company's outlook regarding earnings before interest and taxes could underwhelm investors, given ongoing retail-side pressures. "We see AMZN's high and growing focus on lower-priced, lower-margin essentials driving merchandise margin pressure... which is holding back the near-term slope of its N. America retail profit ramp. Expected discounting in a competitive holiday season (and picky discretionary consumer) create further near-term uncertainty," they said. The bank expects fourth-quarter EBIT of around $17.5 billion, 1% below consensus expectations. This could create some weakness in the stock. However, Morgan Stanley is treating that as an opportunity to buy, as 2025 will unleash multiple profit drivers. That includes Amazon's transition into high-margin ad revenue, as well as upcoming corporate and shipping efficiencies. As with Wedbush Securities, Morgan Stanley doesn't project a meaningful profit impact from Amazon's latest investments, such as Project Kuiper. The bank holds a $210 price target, indicating 13% upside ahead. Wedbush Securities sees two key reasons to celebrate Amazon over the long term: its expanding cloud platform and a revenue shift toward high-margin advertising. "We think the risk/reward is attractive heading into results as investor expectations for 2H profitability have moderated, AWS growth continues to accelerate, and advertising momentum is building into 2025," a team of analysts led by Scott Devitt wrote. Alongside growing cost efficiencies and Amazon's broadening supply chain, AWS and ad revenue will lead significant margin expansion over the next five years. According to Wedbush, investors should take advantage of today's relative underperformance. Instead, Wall Street has pulled back profit expectations amid near-term uncertainty related to Amazon's newest investments, the firm noted. But while initiatives such as Project Kuiper — Amazon's plan to deploy thousands of satellites — may add on costs, Wedbush doesn't expect these to have a meaningful impact on the upcoming results. The firm reiterated its "outperform" rating and $225 price target, implying a 20% increase from current levels. Amazon's third-quarter results will be a mixed bag as consensus revenue estimates are too high, says Bank of America. BofA's Justin Post expects revenue to underwhelm at $157 billion, but predicts that investors underestimate Amazon's operating profits, which should reach $15 billion. The analyst cited AI-driven cloud demand as a top reason to hold Amazon, and noted that accelerating AWS growth might surprise Wall Street. "AI demand likely improved further in 3Q, and we think investors may be expecting 20% y/y growth for 3Q, which would suggest the largest 3Q in terms of sequential dollars added at $1.39bn," Post said. While shifts in consumer spending will remain in place, retail margin growth could reaccelerate in the second half of 2025. The firm has a "buy" rating on the stock and a $210 price target, which implies a nearly 13% gain from current levels. CFRA analyst Arun Sundaram is cautious about Amazon's near-term trajectory, even if the company has compelling prospects over the long run. The firm expects Amazon to notch a "modest" earnings beat after the bell: it predicts revenue to rise 10.5% year-over-year and GAAP operating profit to climb 36%. While AWS and advertising momentum work in Amazon's favor, Sundaram will monitor how the firm's other investments affect profits. Though growth in other parts of Amazon's business should cover these investments, CFRA expects profits to expand more moderately into 2025. CFRA also cited that Amazon is experiencing a tepid spending environment as consumers shift to lower-priced products. The company trimmed its Amazon price target to $219 a share on October 21, indicating 17% upside ahead. JPMorgan highlighted Amazon Web Services, the firm's cloud computing system, as a chief reason to stay bullish on the stock. AWS will continue accelerating through 2025, aided by optimizations, new workload migrations, and Amazon's growing monetization of artificial intelligence. The bank predicts AWS grew 21% year over year, surpassing Wall Street expectations. JPMorgan expects third-quarter net sales to reach $157 billion, falling under consensus estimates of $157.3 billion. Retail profits were likely pressured in the last quarter amid spending headwinds, including Prime Day discounts. According to the bank, consumers have turned cautious on discretionary items, while indicating a preference for deals. Together, these factors have depressed Amazon's average selling prices. JPMorgan has an "overweight" rating on Amazon and a $230 price target. This suggests nearly 23% upside from current levels. 3rd quarter Net sales estimate: $157.29 billion Operating income estimate: $14.75 billion 4th quarter Correction: October 31, 2024 — Amazon expects to have around $75 billion in capital expenditures this year, not $75 million.

Title: Increasing Ways To Get AI Investment Exposure

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has clearly been the dominant investment theme of 2024 and is the next major technology wave. According to IDC, spending on AI will be in excess of $631 billion by 2028. With ever increasing interest and spending in AI, there are also a rising number of ways to participate in this massive theme. ETF baskets are a great way to gain exposure. Just this week, the world’s largest asset manager, Blackrock, launched two new ETFs, the iShares A.I. Innovation and Tech Active ETF (BAI) and the iShares Technology Opportunities Active ETF (TEK). There are likely many more on the way. However, not all are created equal. Some of the beneficiaries of AI may not be immediately obvious. These include Data Center REITs like Digital Realty Trust (DLR) and Equinix (EQIX) as well as companies that are involved with the construction the infrastructure for data centers as represented in the ETF PAVE. Also, the need to generate increased electrical production in the U.S. has had a positive effect on Utilities. In addition, nuclear power is making a comeback in the U.S. Hence, uranium stocks are performing better as one can see in the performance of URA. Stronger Performing AI Beneficiary ETFs: Figure 1: Weekly Charts of Leading AI-Related ETFs Weaker Performing AI Beneficiary ETFs: Figure 2: Weekly Charts of Lagging AI-Related ETFs Broad Market ETFs: Figure 3: Weekly Charts of the Above Two ETFs There are many use cases for AI, most relating to costs savings and efficiency/productivity gains across nearly every sector. Some of the larger being search assistance, automated machine learning, data-driven marketing, fraud/network intrusion detection, financial robo-advisory, supply chain optimization, factory automation, self-driving technology, drug discovery, and more recently generative AI, among others. There will be many opportunities in those companies that can harness the technologies. But we would like to now take a closer look at some of the beneficiaries of all of the spending happening to create the necessary infrastructure, in particular the powering of all of the growing use cases: data centers. In terms of data centers, according to industry estimates, the market size could rise from around $200B in 2022 to nearly $450B by 2028. McKinsey notes that electricity demand from data centers is expected to rise by over 150% by 2030. It usage will rise from under 2% compared to total installed capacity to >4% over the period. While it is a small portion, it is still a huge amount of new power needed. Hyperscalers like Alphabet, Meta, Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft, and Oracle (ORCL) account for around 40% of the data center capacity. Non-hyperscalers (colocation) account for ~25% and on premise for the remainder. Figure 4: Growth in Data Center Electricity Demand As we mentioned in our May Forbes article, “Power Up Your Portfolio With Utilities,” United States overall electricity demand should rise +1 to 3% a year for the next decade. Current estimates could continue to rise. Other more aggressive estimates put the percentage of electricity consumption from data centers in the high-single digits by 2030. Recent power supply deals from Microsoft and Alphabet underscore the coming growth, as well as the continued need to shift towards clean energy sources. Although the Nasdaq 100 and Mega Cap growth groups were huge outperformers over about an 18-month period from the beginning of 2023, they have trailed off in relative terms recently. There has been a shift in leadership from the spenders (hyperscalers) as the leaders to the infrastructure product and services, and energy providers, particularly related to data centers. Below are 25 O’Neil Industry Groups related in some way to data centers, detailed with some price performance and other metrics. Nearly all have been winners over the trailing 52 weeks, however, over eight to 13 weeks, there is a large separation between the top few and the rest. Figure 5: List of O’Neil Industry Groups Related to Data Centers In Conclusion The AI revolution offers many exciting investment opportunities beyond simply semiconductors and software. In particular, companies that construct, operate, and power data centers are likely to be strong beneficiaries of this massive trend. We encourage investors to explore these areas in greater detail as we believe many of these stocks will be market leaders over the next decade.­­ Kenley Scott, Director, Global Sector Strategist at William O’Neil + Co., made significant contributions to the data compilation, analysis, and writing for this article.

Title: BXP Touts 25% Year-Over-Year Increase in Leasing Activity in Third Quarter

Time Published: 2024-10-30T17:28:48Z

© 2024 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy Boston-based developer, owner and manager BXP touted a boost in its leasing so far this year, as leasing activity grew by 25 percent in the first three quarters of 2024 compared to the same period last year. During the third quarter, BXP — formerly known as Boston Properties — signed 74 leases totaling more than 1.1 million square feet with an average term of 7.2 years. “Our performance in the third quarter demonstrated BXP continued resilience and provided evidence of property and capital market recovery,” BXP Chairman and CEO Owen Thomas said on the company’s third-quarter earnings call Wednesday. “Interest rates, corporate earnings, return to the office behavior, outperformance of premier workplaces and valuation in the public and private markets are all currently working in our favor.” The growing return-to-office movement has been a particular boon to BXP’s leasing activity, Thomas said on the call. And that doesn’t appear to be slowing, especially when you consider giant employers such as Amazon (AMZN), Starbucks and Salesforce have all recently initiated some kind of mandatory return-to-office policy for white-collar workers. Indeed, some 83 percent of global CEOs are predicting a full — pre-COVID-19 style — return to office within the next three years, according to 2024 KMPG data. “Asking rents for premier workplaces are 50 percent higher than the broader market,” Thomas said, noting that “approximately 90 percent of our [net operating income] comes from assets located in [central business districts] that are predominantly premier workplaces. The CBD assets are 90.1 percent occupied and 92.1 percent leased as of the end of the third quarter.” When it comes to the New York City market, BXP is still searching for an anchor tenant for its planned office tower at 343 Madison Avenue. But earlier this month BXP broke ground — alongside the Metropolitan Transportation Authority — on a new Grand Central Terminal entrance that will be accessible from the building’s concourse. “When complete, the building will comprise 942,000 square feet, and include state-of-the-art sustainability features, as well as direct escalator access into Grand Central Terminal,” Thomas said on the call. “We hope to launch this approximately $2 billion project next year.” For the first three quarters of 2024 — across all markets — BXP completed 3.3 million square feet of signed leases, Doug Linde, president of BXP, said on the call. Beyond the third quarter, BXP’s pipeline of leases sits at 1.5 million square feet, a 15 percent jump compared to the 1.3 million square feet it had in the works after the second quarter. “If we execute most of the remaining leases during the fourth quarter, we will end the year at over four and a half million square feet of transactions,” Linde said. Additionally, the firm reported its third-quarter 2024 earnings results on Oct. 29 with revenue rising 4.2 percent to $859.2 million for the quarter, compared to $824.3 million for the same period in 2023. Net income was $83.6 million, or 52 cents per diluted share, and it had a net loss of $111.8 million, or 71 cents per diluted share, for the 2023 third quarter. BXP stock was trading in the red on Wednesday afternoon at $82.01 per share, a nearly 5 percent drop from its opening price. Amanda Schiavo can be reached at aschiavo@commercialobserver.com.

Title: Your Mag 7 Earnings Guide
URL: https://dailyreckoning.com/your-mag-7-earnings-guide/
Time Published: 2024-10-29T13:56:43Z
Full Content:
By Greg Guenthner Posted October 29, 2024 Short sellers took a beating last week following Tesla’s post-earnings romp that shot the stock higher by more than 25%. TSLA posted its best trading day in over a decade when management announced it topped Q3 profit estimates and improved automotive gross margins. Just two days later, the shorts banked losses of $4.2 billion closing out bets against the stock during its historic rally, according to data from S3 Partners. Not bad for a company so many investors love to hate… It’s no secret Tesla is a company that evokes strong emotions from just about everybody. Whether we’re talking about Elon Musk’s politics or online trolling, the latest Cybertruck recalls, or dwindling demand throughout the EV space, even casual investors held negative opinions on Tesla following its ugly first-half performance. Tesla shares were driven into the ground despite a roaring bull market for mega-cap tech earlier this year. And even as the stock began to show signs of bottoming out over the summer, most investors continued to expect the worst. I started getting bulled up on TSLA in late June as the beaten-down stock approached a potential breakout at $200. My reasoning was simple: The stock chart was quickly improving, posting a positive reaction to mediocre earnings back in April. Meanwhile, the bearish arguments were getting louder. Well, that $200 breakout lit the fuse for a quick 30% rally in July. And after a hard reset, shares were once again perking up as the fourth quarter began. Following last week’s earnings beat, the stock is now green on the year and threatening to run to $300… and beyond. Why does any of this matter? Because TSLA’s earnings rally was a potential preview of what’s coming when more of the Mag 7 mega-caps report this week. Earnings are unavoidable for anyone with a trading timeframe longer than a couple of months. But momentum and swing traders can mostly avoid earnings surprises if they so choose. That’s usually my style: selling (or partially selling) open swing trades ahead of earnings announcements, and making a point to avoid jumping into a new play directly in front of an earnings release. But I do keep a close watch on earnings, specifically how the Street reacts to the numbers. If TSLA is any indication, we could be in for more than a few powerful post-earnings rallies this week as many of the biggest names report. Here’s what you should expect… Alphabet Inc. (GOOG)Market cap: $2.06 trillion Reports Tuesday (Oct 29) After the Close Estimates:Earnings – $1.84 per shareRevenue – $86.39B Previous Call:Earnings – Consensus: $2.95 per share Actual: $2.94 per share Revenue – Consensus: 64.38B Actual: $68.71B Google (I refuse to call this company Alphabet) missed its annual earnings estimates for the 2022 fiscal year. But revenue remained on track. The company is back in the habit of beating earnings regularly, crushing April’s estimates by 25%. Turning to the chart, we have a lovely setup for a post-earnings rally should the numbers impress investors: GOOG is up more than 90% since the Nov. 2022 bottom, yet it’s approximately 15% off its all-time highs logged on July 10. The stock decisively cleared its 2021 peak in April, breaking into new all-time highs. Price has retested those former highs, found support, and now challenges the upper bounds of a multi-month consolidation. I love springboard plays like this where price retests an area of resistance-turned support. GOOG has already started to bounce – and could quickly run back to those all-time highs near $200 following a positive earnings reaction. Apple Inc. (AAPL) Market cap: $3.56 trillion Reports Wednesday (Oct 30) After the Close Estimates:Earnings – $1.59 per shareRevenue – $94.46B Previous Call:Earnings – Consensus: $1.34 per share Actual: $1.40 per share Revenue – Consensus: $393.09B Actual: $383.29B AAPL is a beast, and arguably the most magnificent of the seven mega-caps. The company has exceeded earning estimates since 2020 – no small feat! And it has crushed its past four earnings reports. Oh, and did I mention the chart is a thing of beauty? Check it out: The stock is up more than 85% off its early 2023 lows. And despite a maximum drop of approximately 30% during its most recent drawdown, the stock continues to power higher off each and every one of those lows. AAPL shares are coiled tightly just below all-time highs. Barring a major negative surprise or a seismic shift in the market, it’s difficult to imagine this stock failing to post new highs in the weeks ahead. Microsoft (MSFT) Market cap: $3.18 trillion Reports Wednesday (Oct 30) After the Close Estimates:Earnings – $3.10 per shareRevenue – $64.57B Previous Call:Earnings – Consensus: $2.94 per share Actual: $2.95 per share Revenue – Consensus: $244.82B Actual: $245.12B Like many companies, Microsoft had a tough time during the 2022 bear market, missing top and bottom line estimates. But it’s back on track and exceeding quarterly projections. Everyone on Wall Street is expecting a strong performance. If MSFT’s performance off its 2022 lows is any indication, we should see a continuation higher: MSFT has more than doubled since Nov. 2022. But the stock has essentially moved sideways for the past eight months. It’s now about 10% off its all-time high set back in July. The big question: Can MSFT escape its choppy, sideways range and continue higher? We’ll see if Wednesday’s earnings can ignite a fresh move higher to begin the journey… Meta (META)Market cap: $1.46 trillion Reports Thursday (Oct. 31) Halloween Night Estimates:Earnings – $5.21 per shareRevenue – $40.19 B Previous Call:Earnings – Consensus: $14.41 per share Actual: $14.87 per share Revenue – Consensus: $133.68B Actual: $134.90B Meta was one of the hardest-hit tech names of the 2022 bear market. The company had just changed its name from Facebook to Meta and was feeling the heat, falling short of earnings estimates as the stock sunk into the abyss. But Meta has miraculously gone from worst to first since bottoming out in late 2022. Now, it’s back on track delivering beats since Q1 of last year. Just look at that comeback rally: Say what you like about Zuck and his metaverse plans – META is up 545% off its 2022 lows. Today it sits just about 5% off its all-time highs posted earlier this month. The stock just completed a 5-month consolidation on its way to new all-time highs, making it the strongest chart of the Mag 7s heading into earnings. A solid beat could keep the party going to $600 and beyond… Amazon (AMZN) Market cap: $1.99 trillionReports Thursday (Oct. 31) Halloween Night Estimates:Earnings – $1.14 per shareRevenue – $157.26 B Previous Call:Earnings – Consensus: $2.70 per share Actual: $2.90 per share Revenue – Consensus: $570.87B Actual: $574.78B Here’s the thing about AMZN: those boxes will keep showing up on your doorstep, no matter what. But the company hasn’t exactly set the world on fire lately. Revenue fell short in 2021 and earnings missed in 2022, yet it steadily beats estimates since the start of 2023. Is there a bigger comeback in the works? Let’s check the chart: If you had to pick a dog to run with TSLA, it has to be AMZN. While we’ve witnessed a strong comeback from its 2022 lows, the stock has yet to post a significant rally above its 2021 peak. If AMZN can impress investors this week, could we finally see a bigger breakout? It’s possible! This is a great chart from a risk/reward standpoint.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks climbed on Monday as Middle East war fears cooled, ahead of a pivotal week packed with Big Tech earnings, an inflation update, and a crucial monthly jobs report. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped roughly 0.7%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) also moved up about 0.5%. The market was bolstered by relief that Israel limited its retaliatory strikes on Iran to military targets, and not oil or nuclear facilities as feared. Oil futures tumbled nearly 6%, taking Brent (BZ=F) down to almost $71 a barrel and West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) to near $67. The focus is on tech stocks with five of the "Magnificent Seven" megacaps due to release earnings this week, after the Nasdaq Composite bucked Friday's losing trend to close near a record. Investors are looking to Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta (META) results to help boost the S&P 500 to new heights, too. But questions remain as to whether Big Tech's investments in AI are paying off in profits. Some on Wall Street are anticipating the slowest growth in earnings for tech megacaps in six quarters. The reports are the highlight in a very busy week of results, with 169 of the S&P 500's members expected to release updates. Philips (PHG) shares sank 16% after the medical device maker cut its full-year sales outlook, citing a strong decline in Chinese demand. Ford (F) is on Monday's docket after the bell. At the same time, investors are bracing for a rush of economic data that could put bets on a "soft landing" to the test. In the forefront are the latest reading on the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge and the October jobs report — both seen as crucial to policymakers' decision on whether to cut interest rates at their November meeting. Read more: What the Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards Elsewhere, stocks in Japan rallied after the country's ruling party failed to hold onto its majority in elections on Sunday — underscoring political risks to markets with the US presidential vote just days away. Spotify (SPOT) shares rose nearly 1% in morning trading after Wells Fargo (WFC) named the stock a top pick, maintaining its Overweight rating and raising its price target from $420 to $470. Spotify has soared over 120% as the company has made good on its turnaround plan. After weak performance in late 2022, Spotify has announced layoffs, enacted price hikes, changed its royalty model, and picked up big podcast deals. The music streaming giant reported a record profit in its most recent quarterly earnings report this summer. Wells Fargo analyst Steven Cahall said in his note to investors Monday that Spotify "continues to demonstrate success on long-term margin expansion." Spotify reports third quarter earnings on Nov. 12, and analysts expect adjusted earnings per share to rise over 400% to $1.82 and revenue to jump 19% to $4.4 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Wall Street analysts covering the stock, on average, see shares rising to $410 over the next 12 months, according to Bloomberg data. Stocks opened higher on Monday to start a pivotal week packed with Big Tech earnings, an inflation update, and a crucial monthly jobs report. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped roughly 0.7%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) also moved up about 0.5%. Oil slid nearly 6% after Israel's retaliatory strikes on Iran spared the country's crude infrastructure. Brent (BZ=F) hovered near $71 a barrel while West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) traded near $67 in early trading. Investors await earnings from Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta (META) this week. The monthly inflation print and jobs report for September are also due out this week. Boeing (BA) shares ticked slightly lower in premarket after the plane maker launched an almost $19 billion share sale in a move to shore up its liquidity and avoid a credit downgrade. The company plans to sell about 90 million common shares and about $5 billion of depositary shares. Wall Street analysts had widely expected a large offering after a difficult year for the plane maker. S&P Global recently placed Boeing on CreditWatch Negative, which increased the likelihood of a downgrade if the machinist union strike at the company continues until the end of the year. Last week, a majority of workers rejected the latest labor contract proposal from Boeing. Earlier this month, the jet manufacturer said it would cut about 17,000 jobs, or 10% of its workforce. As of Sept. 30, Boeing had $56.9 billion of outstanding senior unsecured indebtedness, according to a company filing.

U.S. stock futures are higher as investors prepare for big tech earnings this week; McDonald's (MCD) is bringing its Quarter Pounders back to more than 900 restaurants following an E. coli outbreak; Boeing (BA) announces a $19 billion capital raise amid a costly strike; U.S.-listed shares of Philips (PHG) are plunging as the Dutch conglomerate lowers its full-year sales outlook on a "significant deterioration" in Chinese demand; and crude futures are sinking after an Israeli strike on Iran spared the country's oil facilities. Here's what investors need to know today. U.S. stock futures are pointing higher as investors prepare for a busy week of earnings and economic data. Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Apple (AAPL), and Amazon (AMZN) all report quarterly earnings this week, and the tech giants have helped the Nasdaq post gains for seven straight weeks and advance 0.7% in premarket trading Monday. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are up 0.3% after delivering losses in each session last week, while S&P 500 futures also are higher, by 0.5%. Gold is trading lower, while bitcoin is up about 1%. McDonald's (MCD) will bring its Quarter Pounders back to the menu in more than 900 restaurants in Colorado, Kansas, and Wyoming, as well as portions of nine other states, after an E. coli outbreak last week. Company officials identified slivered onions from distributor Taylor Farms' Colorado Springs facility as the likely source, and won't be serving them on the burger when sales resume there. The news comes ahead of McDonald's third-quarter earnings Tuesday, with analysts expecting revenue to rise but profits to drop slightly. Shares of McDonald's are up by 1% in premarket trading. Boeing (BA) announced it will seek to raise more than $19 billion in capital through public offerings of common stock and depositary shares. The aircraft maker will offer 90 million shares of common stock, which at its most recent closing price of $155.01 would be valued at $13.95 billion, as well as $5 billion in depositary shares. Boeing will use the funding for general corporate purposes including repayment of debt it said. The move comes as Boeing has been struggling with a strike by its union machinists that has lasted more than six weeks. Shares of Boeing initially rose on the news but are now 1% lower in premarket trading. American depositary receipts (ADRs) of Koninklijke Philips (PHG) are 17% lower in premarket trading after the Dutch conglomerate cut its 2024 sales outlook amid a "significant deterioration" in Chinese demand. Philips said it now expects 2024 comparable sales growth between 0.5% and 1.5%, down from its previous forecast of between 3% and 5%. The company's third-quarter revenue, net income, and earnings per share (EPS) all came in lower than estimates from analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha. Oil prices are sinking after Israel avoided hitting energy facilities in its latest strike on Iran. Israel struck several Iranian military facilities Saturday in retaliation for an earlier attack by Iran, but did not disrupt its oil operations. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures are falling by almost 6% to trade at around $67.60 a barrel, while Brent crude is down more than 5% at $71.40 a barrel. Iran makes up about 4% of the global oil trade, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Title: Sam Altman-backed energy stock surges amid AI-driven 'nuclear power renaissance'

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Sam Altman-backed nuclear power company Oklo (OKLO) has boomed on the stock market over the past month as investors look to nuclear energy as the next big AI trade. Shares in the company, which is designing so-called small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs), have surged nearly 140% over the past month on Big Tech’s growing interest in nuclear power. SMRs are designed to produce cheaper, faster, greener energy than traditional nuclear facilities. Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOG) in mid-October announced substantial investments in SMR projects as they look to balance their climate goals with the growing energy demands of the data centers powering their various AI software. Oracle's (ORCL) Larry Ellison announced in September that the company intends to build a data center powered by SMRs. “A nuclear power renaissance is underway with nuclear increasingly viewed as a solution which solves both the increased need for baseload power and the need to decarbonize,” wrote Craig-Hallum analyst Eric Stine in a recent note to investors. Baseload power refers to the day-to-day energy demand on an electrical grid. Stine said Google and Amazon’s investments are “truly just the beginning of a multi-decade megatrend.” Goldman Sachs estimates that global data center power consumption will grow 160% by 2030, driven by demand from artificial intelligence. Meanwhile, separate data from the International Atomic Energy Agency shows nuclear power production in North America potentially doubling by 2050. Stocks of other firms making similar tech to Oklo’s, such as NuScale (SMƒR) and NANO Nuclear Energy (NNE), also surged following news of Google's and Amazon's investments on Oct. 14 and Oct. 16, respectively, before paring gains this week. “The opportunity is so massive here in the market that there's going to be a good number of folks that are successful,” Oklo CEO Jacob DeWitte told Yahoo Finance. In fact, the SMR market could grow to $300 billion by 2040, according to research cited by Citi analysts. Oklo went public in May through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company, AltC Acquisition Corp., which Altman co-founded. In addition to Altman, Cathie Wood and Peter Thiel are on its list of investors. Sam Altman owned a 2.6% stake in the company, according to a regulatory filing in June. He became chair of Oklo in 2024 after serving as its CEO for three years. While Oklo was founded in 2013, well ahead of the AI boom, the energy needs of artificial intelligence have been a boon to the firm as it builds its client book, DeWitte said. “AI does make [up] the bulk of our order book that we've talked about,” DeWitte said in an interview. That includes clients in the chip sector as well as data centers, he added. Publicly, the company has said it's working with hyperscalers Equinix and Prometheus Hyperscale. It has yet to disclose any deals with Big Tech firms. But Wall Street analysts caution that the company and its competitors face regulatory and supply chain hurdles before they can produce anywhere near the amount of power needed to run artificial intelligence data centers. Nuclear projects have been subject to stringent regulations in response to high-profile global nuclear meltdowns at Three Mile Island in 1979, Chernobyl in 1986, and Fukushima in 2011. On average, it takes the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission 80 months to approve nuclear plant construction in the US, compared to an average of 54 months in the UK, according to research cited by Canaccord Genuity. While a number of companies are developing SMRs — including Bill Gates’ TerraPower — none have been deployed in the US to date, and long licensing processes mean profitability isn't exactly on the horizon. In Oklo’s first earnings report since going public on Aug. 13, the company reported a net loss of about $53 million for the first six months of the year, wider than the roughly $9 million loss it posted in the year-earlier period. Fuel is also an issue for companies in the space: Many SMRs, such as those of Oklo, NuScale, and TerraPower, require a specific type called high-assay low-enriched uranium, also known as HALEU, which is imported from Russia. There's little to no domestic supply since the West at large has avoided developing a HALEU supply chain. That's because enriched uranium is used in nuclear weapons, according to Canaccord Genuity. “A developed Western HALEU supply chain is absent, particularly given efforts to limit enrichment due to concerns over proliferation,” wrote Canaccord Genuity analyst George Gianarikas in a note to investors early this year. Citing supply constraints and long and difficult licensing processes, Citi’s Vikram Bagri recently reduced his price target on Oklo stock from $11 to $10. “There are too many ‘ifs’ in this process,” Bagri said. “The new technology and new nuclear installs, it seems like, will happen only after 2030. After 2030, it remains to be seen who gets successful and how successful they get, how many nuclear reactors we see.” But Seaport analyst Jeffrey Campbell sees Oklo having advantages in the burgeoning market, pointing to its ability to use “much cheaper” recycled fuel. Whereas a traditional nuclear plant can take billions of dollars to build, Oklo has said the cost of bringing one of its SMRs online is a few hundred million dollars. For his part, DeWitte is optimistic about the future of the market — and Oklo’s place in it. DeWitte cited mounting bipartisan support to reduce regulatory hurdles and enhance the domestic supply of HALEU. He said Oklo is unique because the company is looking to own and operate its facilities and sell energy directly to customers, rather than the traditional model of licensing its technology to utilities. DeWitte believes this will enable the company to bring its reactors online faster. “In the world today, where this opportunity is so massive — diverse customers that need different things, want different things … you're going to see a diverse ecosystem evolve,” he said. He added, “You're not going to see one winner take all.” Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow her on X @LauraBratton5.

Title: Magnificent 7 shake-up: Why Wall Street is reassessing Tesla's position and looking toward Netflix

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Tesla (TSLA) has work to do if it wants to remain among tech elites. Despite a surprising third quarter earnings report that sent the EV maker's stock surging — resulting in its biggest intraday jump in over a decade — Wall Street is once again reevaluating its inclusion in the Magnificent Seven. The group’s members — Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla — dominated markets in 2023 and have returned as a potential key driver as third quarter earnings season gets underway. The group is expected to lead with 18.1% year-over-year earnings growth in Q3, and four of the stocks — Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta — are projected to be in the top 10 contributors to S&P 500 earnings growth, according to FactSet. The debate over Tesla has returned as concerns linger despite its earnings resurgence. Tesla's third quarter profits jumped 17%, a dramatic turnaround after two quarters of declines. That’s not enough for Wall Street: Strategists tell me it's still at risk of falling behind the rest of Big Tech due to overhyped fundamentals. Freedom Capital Markets chief global strategist Jay Woods likened Tesla to bitcoin, suggesting the stock trades more on “hopes and dreams” than fundamentals. “Tesla had its moment in the sun … to me, it's more like a Cisco (CSCO) or an Intel (INTC) during the dot-com bubble, and now we're moving on to other things,” Woods warned on Yahoo Finance’s Morning Brief. While CEO Elon Musk has often categorized Tesla as a tech company, the firm’s AI and robotics bets will likely take years to pay off. In the meantime, Tesla must rely on improving its core auto business — a stark contrast to its Magnificent Seven peers. “I've been in the tech sector since 1990, and I remember the Four Horsemen … We didn't add an auto stock with Cisco, Intel, Dell (DELL), and Microsoft,” longtime tech investor Dan Morgan told me. Tesla’s recent underperformance and high valuation further strain its standing among its Mag Seven peers. At nearly 73 times forward earnings per Yahoo Finance data, its forward price-to-earnings multiple far exceeds others in the group. As of Friday afternoon, just over 40% of analysts covering Tesla rated the stock a Buy, according to Bloomberg data, making Tesla the least favored Magnificent Seven stock among analysts. As far as Tesla’s replacement, Netflix has emerged as a strong contender. Wealth Enhancement Group’s Ayako Yoshioka noted to me that Netflix “makes the most sense,” as shares of the original FAANG member recently hit an all-time high, buoyed by strong earnings and solid guidance. Since the start of the year, the stock has surged 55%, behind only Nvidia and Meta in the Magnificent Seven. Portfolio Wealth Advisors’ Jesus Alvarado-Martinez told me being a member of the Mag Seven is all about being a “cash flow machine," and Netflix “fits the bill.” “Netflix’s free cash flow has been relentless … Magnificent earnings, magnificent free cash flow, and magnificent subscribers numbers,” Alvarado added. The streamer's free cash flow has steadily climbed since the pandemic, growing to $2.19 billion in the third quarter, up from $1.89 billion a year earlier. For 2023, its free cash flow totaled $6.93 billion, compared to $1.62 billion in 2022. Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich sees Netflix’s growing free cash flow as a “catalyst” for the stock and estimates free cash flow to rise to $8.9 billion in 2025 and $11.16 billion in 2026. As of Friday, analysts are overwhelmingly bullish on Netflix. 87% of analysts covering the stock rate it a Buy, while only 3% recommend selling the stock. While Tesla’s fate in the Magnificent Seven remains uncertain, Netflix’s recent surge reminds investors why it was once a favorite, further bolstering the case that now might be the right time to consider a switch-up in the dominant group.
