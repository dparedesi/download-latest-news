Amazon (AMZN-2.87%) founder Jeff Bezos will sell billions of dollars in Amazon stock over the next year, according to a regulatory filing. The former Amazon CEO and current executive chair will sell up to 25 million shares between now and May 2026, according to the SEC disclosure, which was made publicly available Friday. The value of those transactions would amount to about $4.8 billion at Amazon’s current stock price. The filing says Bezos adopted the plan in March. The disclosure comes a day after Amazon reported its first-quarter earnings. Net sales rose 9% to $155.7 billion, while net income reached $17.1 billion, or $1.59 per share, easily topping Wall Street’s forecast of $1.37 earnings per share. Amazon’s North American sales came in at $92.9 billion and international sales hit $33.5 billion, climbing 8% and 5% over last year, respectively. AWS posted $29.3 billion in revenue, with segment operating income climbing to $11.5 billion — suggesting that demand for cloud and AI workloads remains strong. Ad sales also surpassed estimates, rising 19% year-over-year. Still, Amazon shares were up only 0.2%, to 190.62, on Friday afternoon. The stock is down 13.5% since the start of the year. Bezos unloaded about $13.5 billion worth of Amazon stock last year, the first time he’d sold his shares since 2021. That included 50 million shares in the span of nine trading days in February 2024 and another 25 million shares in July, when the stock was near its all-time high. The timing of those sales coincided with Bezos’ full-time move from the Seattle area, where Amazon is headquartered, to Florida. If he still lived in Washington state, where a 7% capital gains tax was enacted in 2022, those transactions would have cost Bezos nearly $945 million. Bezos didn’t mention Washington state’s new capital gains tax as a reason for his move. But while living there, the billionaire didn’t sell any Amazon stock in 2022 or 2023 after the tax was enacted, Fortune reported. —Catherine Baab and Bruce Gil contributed to this article.

Title: Watch These Amazon Stock Price Levels After Company Issues Soft Outlook

Amazon (AMZN) wavered between gains and losses Friday after the e-commerce and cloud computing giant issued a cautious outlook amid uncertainty about the economy, offsetting strong quarterly results. During the company’s earnings call, CEO Andy Jassy told analysts the company hasn’t seen any significant impact from tariffs denting consumer demand or sellers setting product pricing, but cautioned that may change. He also said that Amazon has remained proactive to keep prices low. Amazon shares had lost 13% since the start of the year through Thursday's close and dropped 22% from their record high established in early February, weighed down by concerns that the company could get caught in the crosshairs of a protracted U.S.- China trade war. The stock was up about 1% at $192 in early-afternoon trading Friday, recovering from losses earlier in the session. Below, we break down the technicals on Amazon’s chart and point out key post-earnings price levels worth monitoring. Since bottoming out last month, Amazon shares have consolidated within a rising wedge. More recently, the price has rallied toward the wedge’s top trendline and 50-day moving average (MA), a move that has coincided with the relative strength index (RSI) crossing back into bullish territory. Let’s identify several key support and resistance levels on Amazon’s chart that will likely gain investors’ attention. A decisive breakdown below the rising wedge pattern's lower trendline could see the shares drop to around $170. This area on the chart would likely provide support near the late-April low and the trough of a minor pullback to the 200-day MA last August. Selling below this level brings lower support at $152 into play. Bargain hunters could seek buying opportunities at a location near last year’s early August sell-off low. This region also roughly aligns with a projected bars pattern downside target that extracts the trend lower that preceded the rising wedge and repositions it from the pattern’s top trendline, speculating where the shares may be headed if a continuation move lower plays out. A breakout above the rising wedge pattern’s top trendline would likely see the stock test overhead resistance near $199. The shares may run into selling pressure in this area near a horizontal line that connects a range of corresponding trading activity on the chart extending back to early July last year. Finally, a more bullish move higher in Amazon shares could propel a move up to $216. Investors who bought at lower levels may see this as high probability area to place sell orders near the stock’s November peak and January trough.

Title: Is Amazon Stock A Buy At $190?

More Amazon can be seen under the blue sky on the façade of Amazon Germany's headquarters in Parkstadt Schwabing in Munich (Bavaria) on April 29, 2025. Photo: Matthias Balk/dpa (Photo by Matthias Balk/picture alliance via Getty Images) Amazon stock (NASDAQ: AMZN) declined approximately 3% in after-market trading Thursday following the company’s March quarter results. While the company beat overall sales and earnings expectations, its cloud revenue came in at $29.27 billion, falling short of the anticipated $29.42 billion. Separately, see 1 Metric More Scary Than U.S. Trade Deficit Or Debt. The company’s Q2 outlook presented a mixed picture. Sales forecasts of $161.5 billion slightly exceeded analyst expectations of $161.2 billion, but projected operating income of $15.3 billion fell significantly below the consensus estimate of $17.6 billion. Amazon’s management acknowledged uncertainties around tariffs but reported no current slowdown in demand. Now, if you are looking for an upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. These kinds of diversified investment options may provide a buffer against the volatility that single stocks like Amazon could experience amid economic uncertainties. The moderate stock decline occurs against a backdrop of increasing economic challenges. The U.S. economy contracted in Q1 2025, and President Trump’s recently implemented tariffs on key trading partners raise inflation concerns. In an environment of slowing economic growth, these pressures could lead companies to cut costs, potentially impacting cloud spending. This would negatively affect AWS, Amazon's most profitable business segment. Furthermore, a significant portion of products sold on Amazon's marketplace are sourced from China. The implementation of higher tariffs would likely force Amazon and its third-party sellers to raise prices for consumers. This price inflation could dampen consumer purchasing power and overall demand, potentially impacting Amazon's core e-commerce revenue. While Amazon has a diversified supply chain, the scale of Chinese imports makes the company particularly vulnerable to escalating trade tensions. Despite these challenges, AMZN stock currently trades at 3.1x trailing revenues, in line with its four-year average P/S ratio of 3.2x. However, the growing AWS business is improving Amazon's overall profitability, suggesting the stock deserves a higher valuation multiple than its historical average. With the stock now down over 20% from February highs, we believe tariff-related risks are somewhat priced in. We consider AMZN a strong long-term investment opportunity at prices around $190. Still, investing in a single stock like AMZN can be risky. On the other hand, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index, less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Tech stocks roared on Thursday, lifting the Nasdaq 1.2%, with the S&P 500 rising 0.6% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 83 points by market close. Amazon’s after-the-bell earnings release showed a handy beat of analyst estimates as the e-commerce giant posted earnings of $1.59 per share, smashing Street estimates of $1.37. Net sales grew 9% to $155.7 billion and AWS segment sales grew 17% to $29.3 billion. Whether Wall Street loves the results is still up in the air, however, with Amazon stock slipping 2% after hours. Perhaps Microsoft’s cloud and AI-related growth set the bar too high. Earlier on Thursday, Mastercard (MA+0.14%) reported a solid first quarter, with net revenue climbing 14% year-over-year to $7.3 billion, or 17% on a currency-neutral basis, and adjusted earnings per share rising 13% to $3.73. Growth was driven by strong cross-border volume, which climbed 15%, and gross dollar volume and switched transactions, both up 9%. CEO Michael Miebach highlighted strategic partnerships with Microsoft and OpenAI, calling the company’s business model “diversified and resilient” despite macro uncertainty. In addition to Amazon results after the bell, investor were also waiting for results from Apple and Airbnb (ABNB-4.46%). U.S. markets rose Thursday morning, lifted by blockbuster earnings from Microsoft (MSFT-0.92%) and Meta (META-2.36%) that seemed strong enough to overshadow Wednesday’s unexpected GDP contraction. With Big Tech’s collective market cap nearing $10 trillion, investor sentiment looked ready to ride the rally — if Amazon (AMZN-2.87%) and Apple (AAPL-0.39%) can stick the landing after Thursday’s close. Unsurprisingly, the Nasdaq was leading the charge, up 1.8%. The S&P was up under 0.8%, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average rising 0.3%. Delivering their latest quarterlies after Wednesday’s bell, Microsoft and Meta both crushed expectations. Microsoft’s Azure cloud revenue surged 33% year-over-year, driving an 18% jump in earnings per share. Meta posted a staggering 89% profit increase on 27% revenue growth. Microsoft stock was up 9% before the bell Thursday. Shares of Meta added more than 6%. The underlying strength of both reports has markets betting that Amazon, as another “hyperscaler” helping bigwig enterprise customers get in on the AI revolution, will keep the momentum going. Apple, with its different mix of exposure to consumer spending, tariffs, and trade winds, was down about 1.5%. Microsoft’s quarter drew gushing praise from analysts both on and off the earnings call, with Wedbush calling it “an Aaron Judge-like performance” (referring to the New York Yankees slugger). Azure beat both the Street and internal targets, with AI workloads accounting for nearly half the cloud platform’s growth. The company reaffirmed its $80 billion FY25 capital expenditures forecast and said infrastructure investments will continue to rise in FY26 — putting to rest speculation about data center cutbacks. Wedbush raised its price target from $475 to $515. Meta stock jumped after hours as the company reported EPS of $6.43 on revenue of $42.3 billion, beating estimates on both the top and bottom lines. “While many companies have held back guidance amid tariff uncertainty, META did — a bullish sign,” Zacks strategist Andrew Rocco said. The company’s Q2 revenue forecast of $42.5 to $45.5 billion topped Street estimates, and planned 2025 capital expenditures of $64-$72 billion suggest Meta is betting big on sustained AI demand. Even after the Senate narrowly rejected a bipartisan push to block Trump’s new tariffs, trade tensions remain unresolved. U.S. Trade Representative Sarah Bianchi Greer said there are “no official talks yet” with China — though smaller deals with other nations may materialize in the coming weeks. The continuing ambiguity continues to haunt earnings calls and cloud forward guidance, and both Amazon and Apple will likely have to mention the elephant as they report later today. McDonald’s missed earnings expectations as global sales fell, revenue declined, and U.S. same-store sales lagged, with the company pointing to wary consumers and geopolitical headwinds. Harley-Davidson (HOG-4.26%), meanwhile, pulled its full-year guidance altogether after international sales tumbled — citing the growing weight of global trade uncertainty. These warnings reinforce that tariff fears aren’t just weighing on Wall Street — they’re reshaping strategy in C-suites across America. And it’s not just large caps like McDonald’s feeling the strain. The Russell 2000, a barometer of small-cap performance, is down 13.5% so far this year — by far the hardest hit of the four major indexes. It’s a reminder that smaller companies, lacking the pricing power and global leverage of Big Tech, may be the sheer most vulnerable. A Wall Street Journal report suggesting Tesla’s (TSLA-3.33%) board began looking to replace Elon Musk “about a month ago” was later denied by the board. Musk recently announced he’d been spending more time on Tesla, however. Tesla stock closed down slightly. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: I Don’t Get GitLab’s Stock Valuation

ByDavid Trainer ByDavid Trainer, Contributor. CHONGQING, CHINA - MARCH 3: In this photo illustration, the GitLab Inc. logo is displayed on a ... More smartphone screen, with the company's latest stock market performance and candlestick charts visible in the background, highlighting GitLab's real-time financial trends, stock price fluctuations, market volatility, and investment developments within the software development, DevOps, and cloud computing sectors, on March 3, 2025, in Chongqing, China. (Photo by Cheng Xin/Getty Images) I originally put Gitlab Inc. (GTLB) in the Danger Zone on October 8, 2021 prior to its IPO. Since the company’s IPO, it has outperformed as a short. Despite the outperformance as a short, this stock remains dangerous. After analyzing GitLab’s fiscal year 2025 10-K, my short thesis still stands. The company is dwarfed by its competition, remains unprofitable, and its stock price is too expensive and offers much more downside risk than upside potential. GitLab grew its total revenue 31% year-over-year (YoY) in fiscal 2025. Additionally, in fiscal 2025, the number of customers that generate: The company also beat on both the top- and bottom-line when it reported fiscal 4Q25 results. Just focusing on top-line growth, rather than trends, would be short-sighted. For instance, the customer segments noted above all grew at lower YoY growth rates in fiscal 2025 than in fiscal 2024. Slowing top-line growth is just one of the concerns of investing in GitLab at current levels, as I’ll show below. The freemium business model has been around for many years, and industry analysis estimates that most software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies have a 2%-5% freemium conversion rate. Conversion rate refers to the percentage of free users converted into paying users. There’s no doubt GitLab has successfully attracted users. Its total registered users have increased from an estimated 30 million in fiscal 2024 to “more than 50 million” in fiscal 2025. Over the same time, GitLab’s base customers, which are the customers that generate more than $5,000 in ARR, increased from 8,602 to 9,893. In other words, in a time when the company’s reported estimate of registered users increased 20 million, its base customers increased by 1,291, much less than the average 2-5% conversion noted above. The number of customers that generate higher ARR is also still a small portion of the company’s base customers. In fiscal 2025, the number of customers that generate more than $100,000 and more than $1 million in ARR were 1,229 and 123, respectively. GitLab’s revenue is largely dependent on converting free users into paying users. The fact that the company converts so few continues to be alarming. Figure 1: GitLab’s Revenue and NOPAT: Fiscal 2020 – 2025 GTLB Revenue & NOPAT As GitLab converts fewer free users to paid users, the recurring revenue generated by existing users is growing at slower rates in recent years. The company measures its ability to retain and expand revenue generated by its existing customers in the form of dollar-based net retention rate, which is calculated by the dividing the current period ARR by the previous period ARR derived from its customer base at a point in time. GitLab’s dollar-based net retention rate fell from over 145% in fiscal 2021 to 123% in fiscal 2025. See Figure 2. Figure 2: GitLab’s Dollar-Based Net Retention Rate: Fiscal 2021 – Fiscal 2025 GTLB Retention Rate 2021-2025 GitLab’s closest competition comes from industry giant Microsoft (MSFT), which owns GitHub after acquiring the company in 2018. Other competitors include large tech/cloud players such as Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Oracle (ORCL), International Business Machines (IBM), and Atlassian Corp (TEAM). The broad cloud services market is dominated by established tech companies that are consistently looking to take market share. More specifically, GitLab operates in the DevSecOps (development, security, and operations) market, which is a segment of the infrastructure as a service industry. The global DevSecOps market size was estimated to be worth $8.8 billion in 2024, which would give GitLab an approximate market share of 9% based on revenue. On the user front, Gitlab’s estimated 50 million registered users would still be half of the 100 million users GitHub reported in 2023. To calculate GitLab’s estimated current market share, I divided the company’s fiscal 2025 revenue (ending January 31, 2025) of $759 million by the global DevSecOps market size at the end of 2024, which was $8.8 billion. Not only do industry incumbents have more users and resources than GitLab, but they are significantly more profitable. Even though GitLab’s net operating profit after-tax (NOPAT) has improved, it is still negative. Per Figure 3, GitLab has the lowest NOPAT margin and return on invested capital (ROIC) in the industry. Figure 3: GitLab’s Profitability Vs. Peers: TTM GTLB Profitability Vs Peers Taking market share in an industry mainly occupied by behemoths will be hard for GitLab, especially considering that GitLab’s revenue is 100% dependent on its DevSecOps operations, while its competitors have many other revenue streams and are more profitable. On top of negative NOPAT, GitLab is burning cash. Since fiscal 2021, GitLab’s free cash flow (FCF) has been negative on an annual basis every year except one (it generated $7 million in FCF in fiscal 2024). On a quarterly basis, Gitlab’s FCF has been negative in 11 of the 12 quarters in my company model. From fiscal 2020 through fiscal 2025, GitLab has burned through a cumulative $1.4 billion (16% of enterprise value) in FCF excluding acquisitions. See Figure 4. Following the same trend, the company’s economic earnings, the true cash flows of the business that take into account changes to the balance sheet, fell from -$163 in fiscal 2020 to -$194 in fiscal 2025. Figure 4: GitLab’s Cumulative Free Cash Flow Since Fiscal 2021 GTLB Cumulative FCF Since 2021 Below, I use my reverse discounted cash flow (DCF) model to analyze the future cash flow expectations baked into GitLab’s stock price. GitLab’s stock is priced as if it will grow revenue at accelerated rates and will 5x its current market share in the DevSecOps industry. I also present additional DCF scenarios to highlight the downside risk in the stock if GitLab fails to achieve these overly optimistic expectations. To justify its current price of $48/share, my model shows GitLab would have to: In this scenario, GitLab would generate $13.1 billion in revenue in fiscal 2035, which is 17x the company’s fiscal 2025 revenue. This scenario also implies GitLab’s NOPAT would reach $2.2 billion in fiscal 2035, compared to the company’s -$93 million NOPAT in fiscal 2025. For reference, ServiceNow (NOW), a much larger and profitable SaaS company, generated $1.2 billion in NOPAT in 2024. The implied revenue in this scenario would be 40% of the estimated global DevSecOps market in 2034, which is far above the company’s estimated market share of 9% in 2024. To estimate the global DevSecOps market size in 2034, I assume the industry continues to grow at the projected 2025-2030 industry CAGR of 13.2% from 2031-2034 to calculate a projected market size of $33.2 billion. Furthermore, companies that grow revenue by 20%+ compounded annually for such a long period are “unbelievably rare”, making the expectations in GitLab’s share price even more unrealistic. If I instead assume GitLab: the stock would be worth $30/share today – a 38% downside to the current price. In this scenario, GitLab would grow revenue to $7.7 billion in fiscal 2035, which would be over 10x the company’s fiscal 2025 revenue. This scenario also implies GitLab achieves a NOPAT of $1.3 billion in fiscal 2035, which is still far above the company’s NOPAT in fiscal 2025. $1.3 billion in NOPAT would be almost 3x higher than Workday’s (WDAY) fiscal 2025 NOPAT. The implied revenue in this second scenario would represent 23% of the DevSecOps market in 2034, which is still nearly triple the company’s market share in 2024. If I instead assume GitLab: the stock would be worth just $12/share today – a 75% downside to the current price. Figure 5 compares GitLab’s implied future NOPAT in these scenarios to its historical NOPAT. For additional comparison, I include the TTM NOPAT of profitable SaaS companies ServiceNow (NOW) and Workday (WDAY). Figure 5: GitLab’s Historical and Implied NOPAT: DCF Valuation Scenarios GTLB DCF Implied NOPAT Each of the above scenarios assumes GitLab grows revenue, NOPAT and FCF without increasing working capital or fixed assets. This assumption is highly unlikely but allows me to create best-case scenarios that highlight the unrealistically high expectations embedded in the current valuation. For reference, GitLab’s invested capital grew 23% compounded annually from fiscal 2020 through fiscal 2025. If I assume GitLab’s invested capital increases at a similar rate in the DCF scenarios above, the downside risk is even larger. Given that the performance required to justify its current price is overly optimistic, I dig deeper to see if GitLab is worth buying at any price. The answer is no. The company has $45 million in minority interests, <$1 million in deferred tax liabilities, $140 million in outstanding employee stock options, and no excess cash. GitLab has an economic book value, or no-growth value, of -$5/share. In other words, I do not think equity investors will ever see $1 of economic earnings under normal operations, which means the stock would be worth $0 today.

Title: 'Best to be cautious': Tariff jitters are high as analysts head toward Amazon's first-quarter earnings

Amazon reported better-than-expected earnings on Thursday but provided an outlook below analysts' expectations, with tariff fears top of mind. The company said it's "heads down, pretty maniacally focused on" keeping prices low in the coming months as tariffs take effect. Though it hasn't seen prices from sellers increase, the company's leaders highlighted ways it's hoping to get ahead of possible disruptions. CEO Andy Jassy said the e-commerce giant's selection and focus on price could make it a destination for customers, much as it was during the COVID pandemic. Jassy also reiterated, as he has during previous earnings calls, that Amazon's investments in AWS will pay off as more businesses turn to Amazon for their AI needs. Amazon's advertising revenue grew 19% and was a significant profit driver, Amazon said. Total sales of $155.67 billion were higher than analysts' consensus expectations of $155.1 billion. Earnings per share of $1.59 beat estimates of $1.36. Sales from the AWS cloud segment came in just under analysts' expectations, while sales at Amazon's online stores segment came in stronger than forecast. For the current quarter, Amazon gave weaker guidance than expected, forecasting $13.0 billion to $17.5 billion in operating income, short of Wall Street's view of $17.82 billion. Shares dropped about 3% in extended trading after closing and are down 13% year-to-date. "What you've seen just in the last few months is really the explosion of coding agents," Jassy says while discussing AWS. One such agent is Cursor, which uses AI to edit code for users. Jassy said that "there's maybe never been a more important time in recent memory" to keep prices low and offer a wide selection of products on Amazon as now, when shoppers are worried about tariffs. Many third-party sellers have brought inventory to the US ahead of the tariffs to keep prices low, Jassy said. But Amazon has over two million sellers, he added, and some might eventually raise prices for shoppers while others avoid it. "We have a lot of different sellers in a lot of different countries, and not all of them will pursue the same tact," Jassy said. CEO Andy Jassy says that Amazon hasn't seen the average selling price of items on its website go up "appreciably" yet due to tariffs. But, he adds, Amazon sellers on its marketplace have an advantage over many more established retailers: Many sellers on Amazon sell products directly from China. Jassy said that's different from other retailers, which often rely on suppliers who source from China before adding their own markups. "The total tariff will be higher for these retailers than for China direct sellers" on Amazon's marketplace, Jassy said. Jassy also compared the tariff environment to the early days of the COVID pandemic, when many customers turned to Amazon for deals on masks and hand sanitizer. Due to its price and selection, Amazon was a reliable source for these items at the time, he said. "We have emerged from these uncertain eras with more relative market segment share than we started and better set up for the future," Jassy said. "I'm optimistic this could happen again." Amazon's call has started. CEO Andy Jassy, CFO Brian Olsavsky, and head of investor relations Dave Fildes are on the call. Analysts are listening for their remarks on AWS's growth, Amazon's AI investments, and how the company is navigating tariffs. AWS's sales came in slightly below analysts' expectations on Thursday. That's "concerning given its outsize role as a profit driver" for Amazon, wrote Sky Canaves, principal analyst at EMARKETER, a Business Insider sister company. That leads to a "big question," Canaves said: Will Amazon cut back on its planned $100 billion in capex spending in 2025? Amazon was one of the big tech companies that indicated it planned to spend heavily on AI infrastructure last earnings season. Amazon was also likely able to beat its guidance for the first quarter as shoppers stocked up on goods ahead of tariffs on imports, Canaves said. "Though Amazon bears heavy long-term exposure to tariffs on Chinese imports, the company remains better positioned than most in the retail industry" to manage the situation, Canaves said after the company reported its results. In its earnings release, Amazon added "tariff and trade policies" as one of the many unpredictable factors affecting its financial results. It appears tariffs are already having an impact: Amazon's second quarter operating income guidance was between $13 billion and $17.5 billion, far below the $17.85 billion street estimate. — Eugene Kim First quarter * Net sales: $155.67 billion, +8.6% y/y, estimate $155.16 billion ** Online stores net sales: $57.41 billion, +5% y/y, estimate $56.85 billion ** Physical Stores net sales: $5.53 billion, +6.4% y/y, estimate $5.41 billion ** Third-Party Seller Services net sales: $36.51 billion, +5.5% y/y, estimate $36.98 billion ** Subscription Services net sales: $11.72 billion, +9.3% y/y, estimate $11.65 billion ** AWS net sales: $29.27 billion, +17% y/y, estimate $29.36 billion ** North America net sales: $92.89 billion, +7.6% y/y, estimate $92.63 billion ** International net sales: $33.51 billion, +4.9% y/y, estimate $33.07 billion * Third-party seller services net sales excluding F/X: +7% vs. +16% y/y, estimate +6.92% * Subscription services net sales excluding F/X: +11% vs. +11% y/y, estimate +8.86% * Amazon Web Services net sales excluding F/X: +17% vs. +17% y/y, estimate +17.2% * EPS: $1.59 vs. $1.86 q/q, estimate $1.36 * Operating income: $18.41 billion, +20% y/y, estimate $17.51 billion ** Operating margin: 11.8% vs. 10.7% y/y, estimate 11.2% ** North America operating margin: +6.3% vs. +5.8% y/y, estimate +6.65% ** International operating margin: 3% vs. 2.8% y/y, estimate 2.96% * Fulfillment expense: $24.59 billion, +10% y/y, estimate $23.78 billion * Seller unit mix: 61% vs. 61% y/y, estimate 61.8% Second quarter * Operating income: $13.0 billion to $17.5 billion, estimate$17.82 billion * Net sales: $159.0 billion to $164.0 billion, estimate$161.42 billion Source: Bloomberg data Investors have been paying more attention to Amazon Web Services in recent years because the company's cloud arm accounts for most of its profits. Amazon's leadership said in the last earnings call said they expect AWS to get a multibillion-dollar revenue boost from its AI business, which is growing at a "triple-digit percentage" year-over-year. They also said capacity constraints over AI chips and server components would ease in the second half of this year, which could accelerate growth. While Amazon's retail arm is expected to feel most of the tariff pain, some analysts expect a broader spending slowdown could eat into AWS's revenue. Investors will also be watching how AWS cloud services compare to Microsoft's Azure, which was a significant point of focus when Microsoft released its earnings report on Wednesday. According to Flexera, a software asset and cloud management company, "the battle for the top cloud provider has been a two-horse race" between AWS and Azure. When it comes to small and medium-sized businesses, Flexera finds that organizations are more likely to choose AWS for their public cloud workloads than any other provider, with 77% running some or significant workloads with AWS. — Eugene Kim & Katherine Li "The retail business powers high-margin services businesses like Prime, advertising, and FBA, and is core to the company's capacity to effectively double-monetize its investment in content," according to William Blair analysts. So when one arm takes a hit, the others do too. "It is not simply about selling the same item at like or lower prices with better convenience. If the model is for any reason starved of breadth, it creates problems deeper into the more profitable parts of the business, which we believe are damaging and hard to game out," the analyst commentary said. — Lakshmi Varanasi Flagging consumer confidence and mounting trade barriers will affect Amazon's near-term margins, but Goldman remains bullish about its wider potential. For the first quarter, Goldman adjusted its estimates to reflect these looming headwinds, assuming that tariffs hurt demand and boost product costs. However, the bank said that Amazon can mitigate the costs associated with its dependence on Chinese markets by reducing exposure and reorienting toward domestic merchandise. "AMZN continues to be the most debated stock among our wider coverage universe on the back of higher global trade tensions," analysts wrote. The bank estimates Amazon will post $154.5 billion in revenue. "Looking long-term, AMZN remains one of our top picks and provides investors with a range of exposures to virtually all key secular growth themes across Consumer Internet and Cloud Computing." Goldman holds a "Buy" rating with a $220 target on the Amazon stock. Wall Street analysts said in April that AWS paused discussions for several data center deals, particularly international ones. They took it as a sign of moderation for AWS's data center expansion after a couple of years of frenzied growth. The findings followed earlier reports of similar moves by Microsoft, which also halted some data center projects. In response, Kevin Miller, VP of data centers at AWS, wrote on LinkedIn that the changes were "routine" and that AWS continues to see "strong demand" for generative AI. "Some options might end up costing too much, while others might not deliver when we need the capacity," Miller wrote. "Other times, we find that we need more capacity in one location and less in another. This is routine capacity management, and there haven't been any recent fundamental changes in our expansion plans." — Eugene Kim Bank of America is gearing up for a strong first quarter, though it sees "uncharted (and tariffed) seas" ahead. BofA is banking on several positives to boost Amazon's first-quarter results. It predicts that net sales will beat consensus estimates at $155.5 billion. Positive factors to expect include: As with other banks, BofA anticipates disruptions related to the trade war, but it's sticking with its upbeat outlook on the potential for Amazon to be a winner of a future trade deal. "We acknowledge 2Q & 2H revenue uncertainty (retail, ads and Cloud), but remain confident on Amazon's ability to take share in eCommerce, improve retail margins via headcount cuts, & benefit from Cloud AI demand," analysts wrote. Bank of America maintains its "Buy" rating and holds a price objective of $225. Amazon was in the news this week over reports that it planned to display how much tariffs are contributing to the price of goods on its main website, though the company denied that such a move was in the works. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the idea would be viewed by the administration as a "hostile and political act." Peter Cohan, associate professor of management at Babson College and a venture capitalist, told BI that tariff transparency could help customers understand why prices are going up, especially for small businesses, many of which also sell on Amazon. "The obvious reason why the White House doesn't want this is because it makes it obvious how much their policy is costing consumers," Cohan told BI earlier this week. "It's going to drive down the poll ratings because consumers will be extremely aware of how much more they're paying and who's causing them to pay it." — Katherine Li Amazon will beat first-quarter estimates with $155.2 billion in revenue and $18.1 billion in operating profits. That's according to CFRA, which expects upside coming from a week dollar, a consumption spike, and faster growth in advertising, cloud, and subscriptions. While the firm agrees with Wall Street about the potential for downside later in the year, it wrote that risk is already priced into the stock. "That said, our current estimates do not reflect a recession scenario, which could materially affect more cyclical segments such as advertising and AWS." At the same time, CFRA expects Amazon to gain new market share as tariffs disrupt e-commerce. The end to the de minimis exemption, which excludes cheap goods from tariffs, would make Amazon more competitive against firms such as eBay and Temu. With capex top of mind for investors, CFRA suggested that Amazon could slow down investments amid macroeconomic turbulence. On April 24, CFRA lowered Amazon's price target to $245 per share. Analysts and investors are monitoring Big Tech's generative AI spending. Amazon appears to be leading the charge with the biggest investment, having previously announced it expects increased capital expenditures this year of $100 billion to go largely toward AI, particularly for its cloud computing division, AWS. CEO Andy Jassy previously said the massive investment was justified because AI is a "once-in-a-lifetime type of business opportunity." "I think that both our business, our customers and shareholders will be happy, medium to long-term, that we're pursuing the capital opportunity and the business opportunity in AI," he said. — Sarah Jackson Amazon's first-quarter results will satisfy investors, but the rest of the year has Deutsche Bank feeling cautious. Deutsche predicts that strong retail sales and a weak dollar tailwind will help the firm beat estimates with $155.5 billion in net sales. However, first-quarter strength is likely to taper off over the coming months, as US tariffs directly cut into revenue. Near-term weakness may seem unlikely given robust consumer activity in April, but that's also due to consumers buying ahead of tariff-related price hikes. "All in, we believe it best to be cautious at this point, and model total 2Q revenue growth $159bn ~170bps below the street." Nervous investors should monitor how Chinese tariffs evolve, any impacts on advertising revenue, and revenue movement through the second half of the year. Meanwhile, improving AWS dynamics are a point of strength, as are Amazon Prime user trends. Deutsche holds a "Buy" rating on the stock, with a $206 share price target. Given that some of Amazon's largest sellers are China-based, any change in their import costs could significantly increase their sales price. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said in a recent CNBC interview that those third-party sellers could raise their prices due to the tariffs. Amazon also buys many products wholesale from its vendors, who mostly source their products from China. Some vendors previously told BI that Amazon has offered cost relief, only if they agree to strict margin guarantees. Meanwhile, internal teams have struggled with forecasting due to the tariff volatility. Even the Amazon Web Services cloud business is preparing its employees to respond to customer questions about tariff hikes and other geopolitical issues, BI previously reported. Some analysts believe the tariffs will pressure sellers to purchase fewer ads on Amazon, further slowing down its advertising unit's growth rate. Bernstein's Mark Shmulik wrote on Tuesday that Amazon could see a 1% to 4% negative impact on global revenues from "various tariff and macro scenarios." — Eugene Kim JPMorgan is upbeat heading into the e-commerce giant's results, pointing out that fundamentally bullish factors set the stage for a strong performance. Though the bank's first-quarter expectations fall short of consensus estimates, Amazon is positioned for strength down the road. JPMorgan analysts project $154 billion in net sales and $17.3 billion in operating income. "We remain bullish as AMZN drives non-Al growth & tightens the GenAl gap, which supports improved AWS trends in 2H," analysts wrote. The bank expects AWS growth to pick up in the second half of the year, assuming macro uncertainty and supply disruptions ease. While tariffs are the key threat in the near term, Amazon has options, JPMorgan said. Up to 40% of products are likely sourced from China, but the firm could pressure suppliers to assume these costs, reroute supply chains, cancel orders, or pass costs on to consumers. JPMorgan rates Amazon "Overweight," with a $220 price target for the stock.

Title: If the U.S. Avoids a Recession, the Mag 7 Will Win Big—and How to Trade While Waiting for Confirmati (Serhii Bondarenko)

Wall Street analysts expect the “Magnificent Seven” tech giants—Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Meta, and Tesla—to deliver an average 15% profit growth in 2025, a forecast that’s barely budged despite rising trade tensions. Should the U.S. economy sidestep a recession, these seven companies are uniquely positioned to outperform. Meanwhile, volatility (VIX) readings can guide whether to lean on Tickeron’s AI Double Agent strategies or revert to simple buy-and-hold—and if the Mag 7 stumbles, you can hedge with inverse ETFs like QID. Why Apple Wins: Services division with >60% gross margins cushions hardware cyclicality. 1.8 billion active devices underpin a recurring upgrade cycle. $200 B+ net cash supports buybacks and dividends. How to Trade: VIX > 25: Run the AAPL Double Agent—long AAPL vs. its inverse (e.g., SCC, ProShares UltraShort Consumer Discretionary). VIX < 20: Buy & hold to capture steady services growth. AI Trading Double Agent – Outperforming Apple Inc. (AAPL) The AI Trading Double Agent strategy is uniquely positioned to outperform traditional trading methods when applied to Apple Inc. (AAPL) and the ProShares UltraShort QQQ (QID). By combining long positions in AAPL, a global leader in technology and innovation, with a hedge using QID, this approach capitalizes on bullish trends in individual equities and bearish swings within the broader tech sector. The dual-strategy framework allows traders to navigate volatile markets effectively, ensuring that profit opportunities are maximized regardless of market direction. This innovative system leverages advanced algorithms and real-time data analysis to identify optimal entry and exit points, making it particularly effective in responding to rapid shifts in sentiment or macroeconomic factors influencing technology stocks. The modern trading landscape demands speed and precision, and Agentic AI is revolutionizing the field with multi-agent architectures. One such innovation is the Double Agent Trading Bot, a cutting-edge system designed to capitalize on both bullish and bearish market conditions. By combining advanced pattern recognition with strategic hedging, particularly through inverse ETFs, this bot provides an intelligent and adaptive approach to autotrading. Its dual-strategy framework enables traders to navigate volatile markets more efficiently, making it a powerful tool for both seasoned and novice investors. Inverse ETFs play a crucial role in this strategy by offering a means to profit from declining markets. These funds are engineered to move inversely to a specific index, allowing traders to hedge against downturns without short-selling. For instance, if the NASDAQ-100 drops by 2%, an inverse ETF tracking the index is expected to gain roughly 2%. Such ETFs are commonly used for short-term hedging due to their susceptibility to compounding effects and tracking errors over extended periods. The ProShares UltraShort QQQ (QID), for example, is one such inverse ETF based on the NASDAQ-100 index, making it a viable hedge against tech-sector volatility. AAPL and QID: Analyzing the Anticorrelation Dynamics The chart illustrates the performance of Apple Inc. (AAPL) and the ProShares UltraShort QQQ ETF (QID) over a one-year period, highlighting an apparent anticorrelation between the two assets. AAPL's stock price shows a generally upward trend, with significant gains throughout the year, culminating in a 33.23% increase by March 2025. In contrast, QID, which is designed to provide double inverse exposure to the Nasdaq-100 index, exhibits a downward trajectory, reflecting losses that amount to -13.56% over the same period. This inverse relationship suggests that as AAPL's stock price rises, QID tends to decline, and vice versa. This anticorrelation can be attributed to several factors, including AAPL's significant weight in the Nasdaq-100 index, which QID seeks to short. As AAPL performs well, it positively impacts the Nasdaq-100, leading to losses for QID, which aims to profit from declines in the index. Investors often use such relationships to hedge risk or capitalize on market movements by taking opposing positions in correlated or anticorrelated assets. However, it is important to note that while the chart shows a strong historical pattern, future performance is not guaranteed, and other market dynamics could influence these trends. Why Microsoft Wins: Azure’s enterprise contracts deliver predictable, high-margin cloud revenue. AI integrations boost Office and Dynamics ARPU. How to Trade: VIX > 25: Deploy MSFT Double Agent, flipping into PSQ (ProShares Short QQQ) or SQQQ (UltraShort QQQ) when risk spikes. VIX < 20: Buy & hold to ride Azure’s secular growth. Why Alphabet Wins: YouTube/Search ads rebound with sticky ad spend. Google Cloud margin expansion. How to Trade: VIX > 25: Use GOOGL Double Agent, hedging with QID (ProShares UltraShort QQQ) to offset tech-heavy weakness. VIX < 20: Buy & hold on ad and cloud recovery. AI Trading Double Agent – Outperforming Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) The modern trading landscape demands speed and precision, and Agentic AI is revolutionizing the field with multi-agent architectures. One such innovation is the Double Agent Trading Bot, a cutting-edge system designed to capitalize on both bullish and bearish market conditions. By combining advanced pattern recognition with strategic hedging, particularly through inverse ETFs, this bot provides an intelligent and adaptive approach to autotrading. Its dual-strategy framework enables traders to navigate volatile markets more efficiently, making it a powerful tool for both seasoned and novice investors. Inverse ETFs play a crucial role in this strategy by offering a means to profit from declining markets. These funds are engineered to move inversely to a specific index, allowing traders to hedge against downturns without short-selling. For instance, if the S&P 500 drops by 2%, an inverse ETF tracking the index is expected to gain roughly 2%. Such ETFs are commonly used for short-term hedging due to their susceptibility to compounding effects and tracking errors over extended periods. The ProShares UltraShort QQQ (QID), for example, is one such inverse ETF based on the NASDAQ-100 index, making it a viable hedge against tech-sector volatility. Why Amazon Wins: Prime ecosystem locks in fee income; AWS powers cash flow. How to Trade: VIX > 25: Activate AMZN Double Agent, shifting into SDS (UltraShort S&P 500) or SPXS (Daily S&P 500 Bear 3X) to hedge broad market dips. VIX < 20: Buy & hold for AWS and Prime tailwinds. Why Nvidia Wins: GPUs are the backbone of the AI boom; data-center margins >70%. How to Trade: VIX > 25: Engage NVDA/NVDS Double Agent, hedging with QID or SOXS (UltraShort Semiconductors) on semiconductor pullbacks. VIX < 20: Buy & hold to ride AI-hardware growth. AI‑Powered Hedging with Double Agent NVDA/NVDS To safeguard portfolios against the kind of abrupt sell‑off NVIDIA may face in China—whether from export‑control news or broader market shocks—Tickeron offers its AI Trading Double Agent NVDA/NVDS strategy. This dual‑agent framework runs two complementary AI modules in parallel: Bull Agent (NVDA): Continuously scans technical indicators, volume patterns, and NVIDIA‑specific news feeds to identify high‑probability long entry points. When the AI detects sustained bullish momentum—such as breakouts on accelerating volume or positive revisions to analyst forecasts—it allocates capital to NVDA, capturing upside efficiently. Bear Agent (NVDS): Simultaneously monitors risk signals—like widening bid‑ask spreads, sudden drops in open interest, or negative regulatory headlines—and automatically shifts exposure into NVDS, a bespoke inverse instrument designed to profit from NVIDIA’s declines. The Bear Agent employs tight stop‑loss logic and dynamically adjusts position size based on real‑time volatility, ensuring that losses are contained and hedges are scaled appropriately. By orchestrating these two agents under a unified risk‑management umbrella, the Double Agent system maintains a net market‑neutral stance when signals conflict, or a directional tilt when one view decisively outweighs the other. Backtests over the past two years show the Double Agent NVDA/NVDS strategy: Reduces Maximum Drawdowns by over 40% versus a simple buy‑and‑hold NVDA position during major sell‑offs. Improves Risk‑Adjusted Returns, with a Sharpe ratio nearly 2× that of NVDA alone. Executes Automatically in milliseconds, eliminating emotional delays and ensuring that hedges are in place the moment bearish conditions emerge. Why Meta Wins: AI-driven ad targeting and potential Reality Labs inflection. How to Trade: VIX > 25: Run META Double Agent, flipping into PSQ or SQQQ when engagement metrics wobble. VIX < 20: Buy & hold to capture high-margin ad profits. Why Tesla Wins: EV market share gains and improving battery margins. How to Trade: VIX > 25: Use TSLA/TSLQ Double Agent, hedging with TZA (Daily Small Cap Bear 3X) or SILJ (MicroSectors Silver 3X) if you need broader market or metal-linked protection. VIX < 20: Buy & hold to benefit from long-term EV adoption. Tesla, Inc. remains one of the most dynamic companies in the world, leading the charge in electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing, energy generation, and storage solutions. As the largest automaker by market capitalization, Tesla has demonstrated its ability to innovate and disrupt traditional industries. With electric vehicles growing in popularity and a global push towards sustainability, Tesla's stock has experienced remarkable growth over the past few years. AI Trading Bot recommends a BUY LONG position on TSLA, reflecting the ongoing optimism about Tesla’s long-term prospects. The company’s expanding product lineup, including electric trucks, energy storage solutions, and advancements in autonomous driving technology, continues to position it as a leader in the future of transportation and energy. In conjunction with the long position in TSLA, the AI Trading Bot also recommends buying TSDD, the GraniteShares 2x Short TSLA Daily ETF. This ETF is designed to provide investors with a leveraged inverse exposure to Tesla’s stock, allowing traders to hedge against the potential for downside movements in Tesla’s share price. Given Tesla’s volatile nature, the hedging strategy of holding TSDD alongside TSLA allows traders to balance their exposure. The ability to capitalize on both the upward and downward movements of Tesla's stock makes this pairing an effective trading strategy for advanced traders seeking dynamic risk management solutions. When the Mag 7 names collectively stumble or the Nasdaq-heavy indices roll over, consider these inverse ETFs as tactical hedges: QID (ProShares UltraShort QQQ): A 2× inverse of the Nasdaq-100—ideal to hedge broad tech pullbacks. SDS (ProShares UltraShort S&P 500): A 2× inverse of the S&P 500—useful when broader indices slump alongside tech. SOXS (Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bear 3×): A 3× inverse of the PHLX Semiconductor Index—targets semiconductor-specific declines. SPXS (Direxion Daily S&P 500 Bear 3×): A 3× inverse of the S&P 500—aggressive hedge in deep downturns. Tactical Example: If VIX spikes above 25 and you’re long NVDA, a quick long position in QID can offset 2× losses as GPUs underperform. When volatility subsides (VIX < 20), unwind QID and shift back to buy-and-hold your core Mag 7 positions. High Volatility (VIX > 25): Markets are prone to abrupt reversals. Tickeron’s AI Double Agents automate hedging across both single-name and broad inverse ETFs, limiting drawdowns. Low Volatility (VIX < 20): Trends become more reliable. A buy-and-hold approach on high-quality names captures secular growth with minimal friction. Earnings beats can reinforce the Mag 7’s leadership; misses may prompt tactical hedges.
