Title: How Much Is $4 Trillion? Here Are Some Ways To Think About Nvidia's Market Cap Milestone

Nvidia (NVDA) briefly surpassed a record market capitalization of $4 trillion on Wednesday morning, an amount of money that could buy you pretty much anything. The tech titan's market value is comparable to some of the largest economies in the world, as a $4 trillion gross domestic product is roughly what was produced in 2024 by Japan and India, per the World Bank, trailing only the U.S., China, and Germany. Here's a rundown of some measures of what the artificial intelligence chipmaking giant is now worth. Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk has become the richest person in the world thanks to his stake in Tesla, where he was an early investor, along with other companies he has helped start or acquire, like SpaceX, The Boring Company, Neuralink, and X. As part of that wealth exists in the form of shares in Tesla, the billionaire's net worth can vary on a daily basis as the electric vehicle company's stock price moves. The Forbes billionaires list on Wednesday puts Musk's net worth just shy of $400 billion, still at least $100 billion more than Oracle (ORCL) co-founder Larry Ellison, Meta Platforms (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg, or Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos, but only about 10% of Nvidia's current value. Based on the current market caps of the just over 500 stocks that make up the landmark index (to account for companies like Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) with multiple share classes, Nvidia's current value could buy nearly half of the index. Starting from the least valuable with Enphase Energy (ENPH) at about $5.5 billion and working up, Nvidia's $4 trillion market cap is worth as much as the bottom 216 companies in the S&P 500, according to Investopedia's calculations. That group includes such household names as General Mills (GIS), Dollar Tree (DLTR), Domino's Pizza (DPZ), and Best Buy (BBY). In its annual ranking of the most valuable sports franchises in the world, Forbes last December estimated that the top 50 teams globally across the NFL, MLB, NBA, and professional soccer were worth a combined $289 billion. That means that at Nvidia's current market cap, it could acquire the 50 most valuable and popular sports teams including the Dallas Cowboys, New York Yankees, and Real Madrid nearly 14 times. In its most recent valuation after the 2023 season, Forbes pegged the value of all 10 teams on the current Formula One racing grid at about $19 billion, meaning Nvidia could afford to buy the racing series more than 200 times. In March 2024, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that the company's then-recently announced Blackwell chip, designed for the heavy workloads of running and training AI models, would cost between $30,000 and $40,000 each, estimating that about $10 billion of R&D costs went into the chip. That means Nvidia's market cap could buy between 100 million and 133 million of its own chips. For comparison, Elon Musk's xAI startup, which makes the Grok chatbot that is used on the social media site X, has installed about 200,000 chips from Nvidia to train and run the product.

U.S. stock futures are ticking higher as investors continue to monitor the White House for updates on tariff policies; Nvidia (NVDA) stock approaches a $4 trillion market capitalization; Starbucks (SBUX) reportedly has attracted offers for a potential stake sale in its Chinese operations that value the unit at up to $10 billion; U.S.-listed shares of Verona Pharma (VRNA) are jumping in premarket trading after Merck (MRK) agreed to purchase the company for $10 billion; and AES (AES) shares are soaring on a report that the renewable energy provider is exploring a potential sale. Here's what investors need to know today. U.S. stock futures are pointing slightly higher as investors watch for more tariffs developments. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are up 0.2% after the blue-chip index shed 0.4% in the prior session. S&P 500 futures are edging higher after the benchmark index declined slightly yesterday, while Nasdaq futures are up slightly after the tech-heavy index inched higher Tuesday. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is ticking higher to trade at around $109,000. The 10-year Treasury note yield is little changed. Oil futures are slightly higher. Gold futures are declining. Nvidia (NVDA) shares are in focus as the AI chipmaker comes close to becoming the most valuable company in history. Nvidia stock rose just over 1% Tuesday to close at an all-time high of exactly $160, pushing its market capitalization to $3.90 trillion. That's just below Apple's (AAPL) closing record of $3.91 trillion last December. Nvidia could reach a market cap of $4 trillion if its share price moves to $163.93. Nvidia shares are edging higher in premarket trading. Starbucks (SBUX) reportedly has attracted offers for a potential stake sale in its Chinese operations that value the unit at up to $10 billion. CNBC said that "almost 30 domestic and foreign private equity firms in China have submitted non-binding offers," adding that Starbucks may retain a 30% stake. According to Bloomberg, which cited people familiar with the matter, most prospective investors in Starbucks' Chinese business "are eyeing a controlling stake in the operation." Starbucks shares are nearly 2% higher in premarket trading. U.S.-listed shares of London-based Verona Pharma (VRNA) are surging 20% in premarket trading after the firm agreed to be acquired by U.S. drug giant Merck (MRK) for $107 per American depositary share, or about $10 billion. The acquisition will add chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) treatment Ohtuvayre, which the Food and Drug Administration approved in June 2024, to Merck's drug portfolio. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter. AES (AES) shares are soaring nearly 15% in premarket trading on a Bloomberg report that the renewable energy provider "is exploring options including a potential sale amid takeover interest." AES has signed deals several tech firms, including Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN), to provide renewable power for data centers. Infrastructure investors including BlackRock's (BLK) Global Infrastructure Partners unit and Brookfield Asset Management "have been studying AES after the company's shares lost about half their value over the past two years," the report said.
