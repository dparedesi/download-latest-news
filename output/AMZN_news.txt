U.S. stock futures are little changed as markets enter the week on a four-session winning streak and investors prepare for a crowded earnings calendar, including reports from Magnificent Seven firms Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta Platforms (META); Domino's Pizza (DPZ) shares are fall in premarket trading after the company reported weaker-than-expected U.S. same-store sales; German drug giant Merck KGaA agrees to buy U.S. biotech SpringWorks Therapeutics (SWTX) for nearly $4 billion; and shares of Deliveroo soar in London trading after DoorDash (DASH) makes an offer to acquire the British food delivery service. Here's what investors need to know today. U.S. stock futures are edging lower as investors get ready for a busy week of earnings and economic data amid a four-session winning streak for the major indexes. Nasdaq futures are down 0.1% after the tech-favored index added 6.7% last week, while S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures also are slightly lower after gaining last week. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is rising to trade over $95,000. Yields on the 10-year Treasury note are rising slightly. Oil futures are lower. Gold futures are little changed. More than half of the Magnificent Seven companies are scheduled to report quarterly results this week, with Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta Platforms (META) all on this week's calendar. Apple's earnings on Thursday come as the iPhone maker has shed 16% of its value this year on concerns over how U.S. tariffs on China will impact the company. Also reporting on Thursday is Amazon, whose stock was recently downgraded due to its exposure to Chinese tariffs. Microsoft and Meta Platform report Wednesday, with the latter's coming as the Instagram parent faces a Federal Trade Commission antitrust court case. Shares of Domino's Pizza (DPZ) are slipping about 2.5% in premarket trading after the company reported weaker-than-expected first-quarter revenue and U.S. same-store sales. The Ann Arbor, Mich.-based company's revenue of $1.11 billion was slightly lower than the consensus of analysts polled by Visible Alpha, while its earnings per share of $4.33 came in above estimates. Same-store sales among Domino's U.S. locations fell by 0.5% year-over-year, worse than the 0.22% bump analysts had forecast. Shares of U.S. biotech SpringWorks Therapeutics (SWTX) are rising more than 3% in premarket trading after German drug company Merck KGaA said it has struck a deal to buy the firm for around $3.9 billion. Merck said it would offer $47 a share in cash for the Stamford, Conn.-based firm. That represents a 26% premium to SpringWorks' 20-day volume-weighted average price of $37.38 on Feb. 7—the day before speculation of a potential deal between the two started, Merck said. SpringWorks shares closed at $44.72 on Friday. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2025. Deliveroo shares are jumping 17% in London trading after DoorDash (DASH) offered to buy the British food delivery firm for 180 pence ($2.40) per share. Deliveroo, which said it had received an "indicative proposal" from DoorDash on April 5, added its board indicated to the U.S. company that "should a firm offer be made" at those terms, it "would be minded to recommend such an offer to Deliveroo shareholders." Shares of DoorDash are little changed in premarket trading.

Title: What Analysts Think of Amazon Stock Ahead of Earnings

Amazon (AMZN) is expected to release first-quarter results after the closing bell on Thursday, with analysts bullish on the online retail and tech giant. All 26 analysts tracked by Visible Alpha who follow the company rate Amazon's stock as a "buy," with every analyst holding a price target above the stock's current levels. The average price target is around $241, a premium of about 29% to Tuesday's close but down from about $259 ahead of last quarter's report. Amazon is expected to report $155 billion in revenue for the first quarter, up 8% from the first quarter a year ago. Adjusted earnings per share are expected to rise to $1.75 from $1.46 the same time last year. Amazon shares have declined about 15% since the start of the year, amid a tariff-fueled market sell-off that has hit the Magnificent Seven hard. Analysts will likely seek more information about Amazon's plans to keep up with the spending pace of its artificial intelligence rivals. But Wall Street's attention is also focused on the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs. Amazon stock was downgraded earlier this month by Raymond James analysts who said tariffs on China could hurt Amazon's profit margins and lead to a pullback in advertising revenue from sellers on the platform who rely on Chinese imports. Morgan Stanley analysts wrote recently that they estimate 18% of products on Amazon are imported from China, and that roughly 60% of third-party sellers on the platform have "some China exposure" that could affect ad spending plans. UPDATE—April 29, 2025: This article has been updated since it was first published to reflect more recent analyst estimates and share price values.
