We recently compiled a list of the 10 Most Promising Future Stocks According to Analysts. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other Most Promising Future Stocks According to Analysts. Volatility in the equity markets is poised to hit levels not seen for the better part of the year as investors battle a string of developments. The uncertainty around the upcoming US elections and the soaring geopolitical tensions in the Middle East are the latest headwinds sending shockwaves in the market. A report by MarketWatch indicates that October could turn out to be a spooky month for equities as valuations appear overstretched, with major indices at all-time highs. Analysts are no longer ruling out the prospects of a market crash given that recession fears are rising even though inflation levels have dropped significantly, prompting the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates.

While expectation is high that the US economy will achieve a soft landing on higher interest rates, leading to lower inflation without causing a major hit to the economy, Michael Darda, chief economist and macro strategist at Roth Capital Partners, is sounding warning bells. The economist maintains we are marching on ice that’s a bit thinner, depicted by rising unemployment and elevated earnings expectations that triggered market routes in August and September. “It’s not unprecedented to have a slowdown period that looks like a soft landing, and then a recession ends up taking shape,” he said. “That’s sort of unexpected now because many have been lulled into this idea that the soft landing is going to be a permanent state of affairs for the business cycle. Equity market valuations reflected that coming into the summer.” “But there’s been some cracks in the business cycle,” he cautioned, noting expectations for the economy, corporates, and the stock market have remained at “super high” levels. A slowdown in the US economy amid the high interest rate environment comes amid a highly charged election that threatens to rattle the stock market. While indices are at all-time highs at the back of one of the longest bull runs, the prospects of a deep pullback are growing as investors become more cautious ahead of the election. While the US stocks have often rallied following a major US election, Former Goldman Sachs partner Abby Joseph Cohen believes things could turn around this time around. “Historically when you go back many cycles you see that the US stock market does pretty well after a major election. There is a sigh of relief and also most people feel that their candidate has won. This year aim not convinced it is going to be a sigh of relief rally. In fact if anything I am quite concerned about what happens if there is agitation of any sort following the election because of uncertainty about results,” Cohen said. Although there is a good chance that the US stock market will crash this time, many analysts are also saying that things might improve following a very bad September that also saw premium stocks like the S&P 500 plummet and hit all-time lows. AI-related firms continue to drive market gains, with the S&P 500 up 21% year-to-date. Howard Chan, CEO of Kurv Investment Management, highlighted the importance of monetizing AI initiatives, noting Meta’s share price surge due to strong sales growth. Analysts are increasingly focusing on promising future stocks, particularly those in advanced technologies, which are expected to withstand short-term pressures and deliver long-term value. Investing in industry leaders with a competitive edge and a strong track record of revenue and earnings growth, combined with low interest rates, is seen as a strategy likely to yield significant returns. Despite market volatility, certain stocks continue to offer substantial opportunities and the potential to generate significant long term value. Pixabay/ Public Domain Our Methodology To make our list of the most promising future stocks to buy according to analysts, we made a list of 40 stocks with market capitalization greater than $10 billion, significant average analyst share price percentage upside, and an average rating of Buy or better. They were then ranked in ascending order based on analyst’s upside potential, and the most promising future stocks are as follows. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Number of Hedge Fund Holders as of Q2: 308 Analyst Upside as of October 10, 2024: 20.45% Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a market leader in cloud computing and e-commerce retail, affirming its long-term growth prospects. The company generates a significant chunk of its revenues from e-commerce, with a market share of 37.6%. Cloud computing is increasingly becoming an essential piece of the puzzle amid artificial intelligence, as the company has a market share of 31% in the multibillion-dollar industry. The segment posted an 18.8% revenue increase in Q2 and has reported 30% plus operating margins consistently for the past five quarters. Likewise, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is diversifying its operations into the fiercely competitive streaming service ad-supported market. As the US tech giant intensifies its push into ad-funded streaming services, it plans to introduce more ads across its popular TV series and films on Prime Video in the upcoming year. By the end of the year, Amazon is expected to have $127.4 billion in cash and short-term investments, which will be three times its 2018 total. It is also expected to have nearly $400 billion in cash by 2027, far exceeding its competitors in the Big Tech sector. This is an incredible transformation for a business known for operating on thin margins, reinvesting most of its profits, and having comparatively little cash compared to its peers. Record profits from cloud computing, advertising, and increased efficiency, including cost reduction, are the main drivers of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ‘s cash increase. S&P Global Market Intelligence estimates that the company’s free cash flow will almost double from $36.8 billion last year to $70.8 billion in 2025. After other tech companies like Alphabet and Meta began giving back more of their cash to shareholders earlier this year, there was a surge in hopes for an Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) dividend or at least more share buybacks in recent quarters. Likewise, analysts on Wall Street rate the stock as a Buy with an average price target of $222.95, implying 20.45% upside potential from current levels. According to our Insider Monkey database, AMZN was held by 308 hedge funds at the close of Q2 2024 with total stakes amounting to $65.85 billion. Meridian Hedged Equity Fund stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q2 2024 investor letter: “Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a global technology company that operates e-commerce, cloud computing, digital advertising, and other businesses. We own Amazon because we believe it is well-positioned to benefit from several strong secular trends, including the shift to online shopping, the growth of cloud computing, and the increasing importance of digital advertising. The company exceeded expectations in the first quarter, with cloud-computing revenue growth accelerating, driven by easing cost optimization pressures and the ramp of generative AI workloads. The North American retail segment drove record operating margins, highlighting the success of Amazon’s efforts to improve efficiency and lower its cost to serve. International retail also showed promise, as emerging markets steadily progressed towards profitability. Given the strength across these key segments, we continue to hold the position in the company.” Overall AMZN ranks 8th on our list of 10 Most Promising Future Stocks According to Analysts. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Getty Images/iStockphoto Certain companies have risen to prominence in the ever-evolving stock market landscape, capturing the attention of investors and analysts alike. Seven technology giants have emerged, collectively known as the "Magnificent Seven." These companies have reshaped industries and become powerhouses in the global economy, wielding significant influence over market trends and investor sentiment. The term "Magnificent Seven" in the context of the stock market refers to a group of large-cap technology companies that have dominated the U.S. stock market in recent years. These companies are at the forefront of innovation in various tech sectors, including cloud computing, e-commerce, social media, artificial intelligence and electric vehicles. The Magnificent Seven stocks have profoundly impacted significant market indices, particularly the S&P 500. Due to their massive market capitalizations and firm performance, these stocks have disproportionately influenced the index's overall performance. Their combined weight in the S&P 500 has at times exceeded 35%, meaning the performance of just these seven stocks can significantly sway the entire index. This concentration of market power in a small group of tech companies has excited and concerned investors and market analysts. While their growth has driven substantial gains in the broader market, it has also raised questions about market concentration and the potential risks of overreliance on a handful of stocks. The term Magnificent Seven, as it applies to these specific stocks, gained widespread usage in the financial media and among investors in early 2023. It was popularized as these companies consistently outperformed the broader market and became increasingly dominant in their respective sectors. The name is a nod to the classic 1960 Western film The Magnificent Seven, which featured seven gunfighters hired to protect a village. In the stock market context, these seven companies are seen as protectors and drivers of market growth, especially during times of economic uncertainty. The term caught on quickly, becoming a shorthand way to refer to this group of influential tech stocks that have shaped market dynamics in recent years. Much more than breaking news, our diverse reporting digs deeper with unparalleled insights that empower you to make better informed decisions. Become a Forbes member and unlock unlimited access to cutting-edge strategies, actionable insights, and updated analysis from our network of leading finance experts. The Magnificent Seven stocks comprise some of the most recognizable names in the technology sector. These companies have become household names, not just for investors but for consumers worldwide. Let's take a closer look at each of these tech giants: Apple is a global technology company headquartered in Cupertino, California. Founded in 1976 by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne, Apple has become one of the world's most valuable companies, with a market cap of more than $3.5 trillion. The company is renowned for its innovative consumer electronics, software and services. Apple's product line includes the iPhone, iPad, Mac computers, Apple Watch and various services such as Apple Music, Apple TV+ and iCloud. The company's ecosystem of products and services has created a loyal customer base, contributing to its strong financial performance and market position. Microsoft, founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen in 1975, is a multinational technology company headquartered in Redmond, Washington. Initially known for its Windows operating system and Office productivity software suite, Microsoft has diversified into cloud computing, gaming and artificial intelligence. Microsoft's Azure cloud platform has become a significant player in the cloud computing market, competing directly with Amazon Web Services. Other notable products include the Xbox gaming console, the Surface line of devices, and the LinkedIn professional networking platform. Amazon.com, founded by Jeff Bezos in 1994, started as an online bookstore but has since grown into the world's largest e-commerce company. Headquartered in Seattle, Washington, Amazon has expanded its operations to include cloud computing, digital streaming and artificial intelligence. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the company's highly profitable cloud computing platform. The company also offers Prime Video streaming service and the Alexa virtual assistant and has made significant inroads into the grocery sector by acquiring Whole Foods Market. Alphabet is the parent company of Google, founded by Larry Page and Sergey Brin in 1998. While Google remains its largest subsidiary and is best known for its search engine, Alphabet oversees various other businesses and initiatives. Google's services include Gmail, Google Maps, Google Cloud and the Android mobile operating system. Alphabet is also involved in more speculative technological endeavors through its "Other Bets" segment, which includes companies like Waymo (self-driving cars) and Verily (life sciences research). Tesla, founded in 2003 and led by CEO Elon Musk since 2008, is an American multinational corporation specializing in electric vehicles, energy storage and solar panel manufacturing. Headquartered in Austin, Texas, Tesla has been at the forefront of the electric vehicle revolution. The company's product line includes electric cars such as the Model S, Model 3, Model X and Model Y and energy storage solutions like the powerwall and solar roof tiles. Tesla's innovations have forced traditional automakers to accelerate their transition to electric vehicles. Meta Platforms, formerly known as Facebook, was founded by Mark Zuckerberg in 2004. Headquartered in Menlo Park, California, Meta is a social technology company that owns and operates some of the world's most popular social media and messaging platforms. The company's flagship products include Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger. In recent years, Meta has invested heavily in virtual and augmented reality technologies, signaling its ambition to lead the development of the "metaverse."

Nvidia, founded in 1993 and headquartered in Santa Clara, California, is a technology company best known for its graphics processing units (GPUs) used in gaming and professional markets. In recent years, Nvidia has become a significant player in artificial intelligence and machine learning. The company's GPUs are widely used in data centers for AI training and inference, as well as in autonomous vehicles and robotics. Nvidia's technology is also crucial in developing the metaverse and other advanced computing applications. The Magnificent Seven have earned their moniker due to their dominant positions in and outsized global economic impact. These companies are at the forefront of technological innovation, driving advancements in artificial intelligence, cloud computing, e-commerce and digital advertising. Their products and services have become integral to both businesses and consumers worldwide. The Magnificent Seven's influence is pervasive, from the smartphones in our pockets to the cloud infrastructure powering countless applications. Moreover, their financial might and market capitalizations have made them significant players in the stock market, often serving as bellwethers for the broader technology sector and the economy. The performance of the Magnificent Seven stocks in recent years has been nothing short of extraordinary. These companies have consistently outperformed the broader market, driving a significant portion of the gains in major indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. In 2020, these tech giants demonstrated remarkable resilience amid the global pandemic. As the world shifted to remote work and digital services, companies like Amazon, Microsoft and Apple saw their revenues and stock prices soar. The trend continued into 2021 and 2022, with these stocks often defying broader market volatility. However, it's important to note that their performance could have been more uniformly positive. Market sentiment, regulatory concerns and company-specific issues have led to periods of volatility. For instance, Meta (then Facebook) faced privacy concerns and regulatory scrutiny challenges, while Tesla has seen significant price swings tied to production issues and Elon Musk's public statements. Many analysts and economists remain optimistic about the Magnificent Seven's long-term growth prospects. These companies are well-positioned to benefit from ongoing technological trends, such as the continued shift to cloud computing, the growth of e-commerce, advancements in artificial intelligence, and the development of new technologies like autonomous vehicles and the metaverse. Apple and Microsoft, with their robust ecosystem of products and services, are expected to continue benefiting from the increasing digitization of business and personal life. Amazon's e-commerce dominance and the growth of its cloud computing arm, AWS, position it well for future growth. Alphabet (Google) and Meta will likely continue benefiting from the shift to digital advertising. As a leader in electric vehicles, Tesla is poised to capitalize on the global transition to sustainable transportation. With its crucial role in AI and high-performance computing, Nvidia is well-positioned to benefit from the increasing demand for these technologies across various industries. However, it's important to note that past performance doesn't guarantee future results. These companies face challenges, including increased regulatory scrutiny, intensifying competition, and the need to innovate to maintain their market positions continually. While the Magnificent Seven stocks have shown impressive performance, they are not without risks. One of the primary concerns is their high valuations. Many of these stocks trade at premium multiples compared to the broader market, which could make them vulnerable to significant corrections if they fail to meet high growth expectations. Regulatory risk is another primary concern. As these companies have grown in size and influence, they have attracted increased scrutiny from regulators worldwide. Antitrust investigations, data privacy concerns, and new regulations could impact their business models and growth prospects. Market concentration is another risk factor. The outsized influence of these seven stocks on major indices means that any significant downturn in their performance could have a disproportionate impact on the broader market. This concentration also raises concerns about market diversity and the potential for increased volatility. Finally, as leaders in their respective fields, these companies face constant pressure to innovate and stay ahead of competitors. Please do so to avoid loss of market share and investor confidence. Analyst and investor sentiment towards the Magnificent Seven stocks has generally been positive, reflecting their strong financial performance and dominant market positions. Many analysts maintain "buy" or "outperform" ratings on these stocks, citing their strong cash flows, robust balance sheets, and opportunities for continued growth. Investors have been attracted to these stocks for their growth potential and, in some cases, their ability to return capital to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. Given their financial strength and market dominance, the Magnificent Seven have often been seen as a haven during market uncertainty. However, sentiment can shift quickly based on earnings reports, macroeconomic conditions, or company-specific news. For instance, concerns about inflation and rising interest rates in 2022 led to a sell-off in tech stocks, including some of the Magnificent Seven. The influence of the Magnificent Seven on the overall stock market cannot be overstated. Due to their massive market capitalizations, these seven stocks can significantly sway major indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite. Their performance often sets the tone for the broader technology sector and can influence overall market sentiment. Robust earnings reports from these companies can lift the entire market, while disappointing results can lead to broader selloffs. The Magnificent Seven's dominance has also raised questions about market concentration and its potential implications for index fund investors. As these stocks have grown to represent a more significant portion of market-cap-weighted indices, passive investors may have greater exposure to these companies than they realize. The Magnificent Seven stocks represent a technology giant group that has reshaped industries and dominated stock market performance in recent years. Their innovative products and services, financial strength, and market influence have made them key players in the global economy. While these stocks offer significant growth potential, they also come with risks, including high valuations, regulatory scrutiny, and the constant pressure to innovate. Investors should carefully consider these factors and their risk tolerance when evaluating these stocks as part of their investment strategy. The Magnificent Seven stocks are Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), Tesla, Meta (Facebook) and Nvidia. These large-cap technology companies have significantly influenced the U.S. stock market recently. You can invest in the Magnificent Seven by purchasing individual stocks or through index funds and ETFs with significant exposure to these companies, such as those tracking the S&P 500 or Nasdaq-100. These companies are influential due to their massive market capitalizations, dominant positions in their respective industries and their role in driving technological innovation across various sectors of the economy. Risks include high valuations, regulatory scrutiny, intense competition and market concentration. Additionally, their immense influence on market indices means any significant downturn in their performance could impact the broader market.

ERIC KIM Here is a list comparing the Sharpe ratios of Bitcoin and top tech stocks as of 2024, reflecting their risk-adjusted returns: 1. Bitcoin: Sharpe ratio around 1.3, driven by high volatility and significant price momentum during bullish phases . 2. Tesla (TSLA): Sharpe ratio around 0.9 to 1.2, with high volatility tied to its growth trajectory in the EV sector Ratios | ETC Group. 3. Nvidia (NVDA): Sharpe ratio around 0.8 to 1.3, benefiting from high demand in the AI and semiconductor industries but also showing notable price swings Ratios | ETC Group. 4. Apple (AAPL): Sharpe ratio around 0.7 to 1.0, reflecting steady performance with moderate volatility compared to other tech stocks Ratios | ETC Group. 5. Amazon (AMZN): Sharpe ratio around 0.7 to 0.9, with volatility tied to both e-commerce trends and cloud computing growth . 6. Microsoft (MSFT): Sharpe ratio around 0.8 to 1.0, reflecting strong performance and relatively lower volatility due to its diversified business segments . 7. Meta (META): Sharpe ratio around 0.6 to 0.9, impacted by volatility as it transitions into the metaverse space, leading to fluctuations in its stock value . 8. NASDAQ 100 Index (QQQ): Sharpe ratio around 0.9, capturing the broader tech sector’s risk-adjusted return and benefiting from diversification . Bitcoin’s Sharpe ratio often aligns with or exceeds those of individual high-growth tech stocks due to its high potential returns, but also carries a much higher volatility, leading to similar risk-adjusted returns as these tech leaders. … As of recent analyses, here are some specific Sharpe ratio figures comparing Bitcoin and the S&P 500: 1. Bitcoin: In 2023, Bitcoin’s Sharpe ratio averaged around 0.82, reflecting its high volatility alongside periods of substantial returns . This figure has fluctuated due to Bitcoin’s rapid price movements and recent lower volatility, as it matured amidst institutional adoption and regulatory clarity. 2. S&P 500: The S&P 500 achieved a Sharpe ratio of approximately 0.95 over the same period . This higher ratio compared to Bitcoin suggests more consistent risk-adjusted returns, benefiting from the stability of a diversified portfolio of established companies in the index. Historically, these ratios can vary depending on economic conditions, but generally, the S&P 500 maintains a slight edge over Bitcoin in terms of risk-adjusted performance due to its lower volatility and more predictable returns. … As of recent data, the Sharpe ratio for Bitcoin has generally been lower compared to the S&P 500, reflecting Bitcoin’s high volatility despite its strong performance. Over the past year, the Sharpe ratio for Bitcoin has hovered around 0.82, while the S&P 500 achieved a slightly higher ratio of approximately 0.95 . Historically, Bitcoin’s risk-adjusted returns have varied more than the S&P 500’s due to its price volatility, which has sometimes exceeded 50% annually. However, in 2023 and into early 2024, Bitcoin saw reduced volatility, potentially signifying a maturing asset class. During this period, Bitcoin’s market performance was significantly enhanced by institutional adoption and regulatory developments, such as Bitcoin ETF approvals . In comparison, the S&P 500 maintains more consistent risk-adjusted returns, typically benefiting from its diversification across major U.S. companies. The lower volatility and stable returns of the S&P 500 contribute to its Sharpe ratio advantage over Bitcoin, especially in periods when economic and regulatory factors reduce Bitcoin’s appeal as a high-risk asset .

Title: Is Microsoft Stock Heading To A $4 Trillion Valuation? Taking Cues From Buyback And Dividend Hike Plans
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/is-microsoft-msft-stock-heading-4-trillion-valuation-buyback-dividend-hike/

(Photo by Chesnot/Getty Images) After a jubilant runup to all-time highs, Microsoft (MSFT) shares are taking a pause subsequent to a protracted period of AI optimism for big techs. The tech giant’s elevated levels of AI capital spending that have yet to translate into tangible returns appear to be causing some unease among investors. Exacerbating the concerns, growth in Microsoft’s much-hailed Azure cloud services during the recent fourth quarter was perceived as weaker than expected. The beginning of a Fed rate easing cycle is also motivating investors to look beyond the overheated valuations of mega techs. Microsoft recently announced a 10% increase in its quarterly dividend alongside a mammoth share buyback program of up to $60 billion. Is the Microsoft stock a buy in view of its dividend hike and stock buyback plans? Where is the Microsoft stock headed? Is a $4 trillion valuation in the cards for the MSFT stock? After touching a 52-week intra-day high of $468.35 on July 5, the stock receded and closed at a low of $394.44 on August 5 following its fourth-quarter earnings release on July 30. Although MSFT reported better-than-expected earnings and revenues for the fourth quarter, the market chose to focus on the shortfall in its Azure cloud revenues. Azure is a key area of focus for analysts, as it competes with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud. Microsoft is going head-to-head with the other two for capturing new business. The investments towards Azure AI growth, drive a significant portion of the capex spend for MSFT. So, it’s good to know that AI services contributed 8 percentage points, accounting for more than a fifth of the growth in “Azure and other cloud services” revenue during the fourth quarter. In response to an analyst’s query in the fourth-quarter earnings conference call, Microsoft attributed capacity constraints for impacting Azure growth, noting that AI demand remained higher than available capacity. These capacity restrictions alongside softness in non-AI consumption in some European geographies are expected to continue into the first half of fiscal 2025. However, Azure growth is expected to accelerate in the second half of fiscal 2025, as capital investments should increase available AI capacity to serve the growing demand. Much more than breaking news, our diverse reporting digs deeper with unparalleled insights that empower you to make better informed decisions. Become a Forbes member and unlock unlimited access to cutting-edge strategies, actionable insights, and updated analysis from our network of leading finance experts. In July, Microsoft noted that its revenue from Azure and other cloud services grew 29% year over year during the fourth quarter. (Typically, Microsoft does not disclose the dollar value of revenue for this category.) The growth was 30% in constant currency (assuming constant exchange rates) in line with Microsoft’s guidance for 30% to 31% growth, but fell short of the 31% growth pegged by analysts. It caught the market off-guard as Azure growth numbers have never missed estimates since 2022. The lack of visibility into cloud consumption trends also poses a problem. The Azure consumption business (in which businesses only pay for the resources and services consumed), which includes AI, has historically grown faster than the per user business. However, Microsoft typically features the slower-growing per-user pieces in the Azure and other cloud services’ revenue stream, complicating the visibility into the consumption of Azure. However, in August, Microsoft updated its reporting structure to enhance visibility into its cloud consumption revenue and the benefits of AI for the overall business. Under the new reporting framework, the slower growing per-user revenue streams such as the Power BI data analytics tool and the Enterprise Mobility and Security (EMS) product suite will be excluded from the closely monitored Azure and other cloud services metric. With the relocation of these two components, the new Azure number is expected to now align more closely to the consumption business. However, Microsoft will be adding revenue from its search and news advertising category into Azure and other cloud services. So, the updated Azure and other cloud services revenue growth metric will include revenue from Azure and other cloud services, including cloud and AI-consumption based services, GitHub cloud services, Nuance Healthcare cloud services, virtual desktop offerings and other cloud services. Subsequent to the reclassification, Microsoft restated its investor metrics, including Azure and other cloud services revenue growth and updated its first-quarter guidance. Based on the restatement, revenue from Azure and other cloud services for the fourth quarter grew 34% to 35% in constant currency (vs. 29% to 30% growth in constant currency reported in July). For the first quarter, revenue growth for the new Azure and other cloud services is expected to be 33% in constant currency (vs. prior projections for growth of 28% to 29% in constant currency in July). Based on the takeaways from the July earnings call, there appears to be no slowdown in demand for Azure consumption. The quote from Microsoft’s CFO Amy Hood, “Azure consumption business continues to grow faster than total Azure.” has a nice reassuring ring to it. With the reorganization in reporting structure, the upcoming first quarter earnings print will likely offer more helpful context on how Azure is shaping up for the second quarter and future periods. Microsoft’s intelligent digital assistants called Copilot streamline workflows. Copilot can help draft emails and reports, summarize documents, provide data insights, create presentations, generate software code and automate repetitive tasks. About 60% of Fortune 500 companies have adopted Copilots. Copilot is used in GitHub (which is a code-sharing platform) for providing AI assistance in software coding. More than 77,000 organizations have adopted GitHub Copilot, and the number is up 180% year over year. The use of Copilot has pushed GitHub’s annual revenue run rate to $2 billion and accounted for 40% of GitHub’s revenue growth in fiscal 2024. Copilot for Microsoft 365 is gaining solid traction; customers grew more than 60% quarter-over-quarter, while the number of people who used Copilot daily at work doubled. The number of customers with more than 10,000 seats more than doubled quarter over quarter, including Capital Group, Disney, Dow, Kyndryl, Novartis and EY, which alone is expected to deploy Copilot to 150,000 of its employees. Copilot is still in the nascent stages of growth, but already showing great promise as a future driver of recurring revenue growth for MSFT. With the rollout of additional features and functionality, Copilot is expected to deliver even greater value. The Copilot add-on for Microsoft 365 plan costs $30 per user per month, while a basic business subscription for Microsoft 365 costs $6 per user per month, a standard business subscription costs $12.50 and a premium business subscription costs $22.50.

During its fourth-quarter earnings call, Microsoft addressed the elephant in the room–the raging industry debate about the monetization of its significant investments in generative AI. Capital expenditures, including finance leases, totaled $55.7 billion for fiscal 2024 (including $11.2 billion in first-quarter 2024, $11.5 billion in second-quarter 2024, $14 billion in third-quarter 2024 and $19 billion in fourth-quarter-2024) up 75% year over year. A bulk of the capex spend is towards cloud and AI-related investments. Microsoft said that nearly 50% of its capex went towards infrastructure needs, like the land and data center buildout, while the rest was decided by “demand signals.” CPUs or GPus will be bought only based on these demand signals. Azure AI growth, and recurring customers for Microsoft 365 Copilot are some of the demand signals that decide the trajectory of more than 50% of Microsoft’s capital spending toward cloud and AI-related investments. While responding to an analyst’s question, Microsoft said it could see consistent revenue growth even without this sort of elevated capital expense because of the variable nature of the capex. In what could be viewed as an elaboration on the demand signals, Microsoft said it witnessed record commitments to its Microsoft Cloud platform in the fourth quarter and commercial bookings were significantly ahead of expectations rising 17% (and 19% in constant currency) year over year, thanks to growth in the number of $10 million-plus and $100 million-plus contracts for both Azure and Microsoft 365. Microsoft has more than 60,000 Azure AI customers, up nearly 60% year over year with the average spend per customer continuing to grow. Microsoft said that the expansion of its data center footprint targeting investments across four continents aimed to create long-term assets globally to drive growth for the next decade and beyond. Fiscal 2025 capex is expected to be higher vs. fiscal 2024, and tied to demand signals and adoption of its AI-based services. MSFT plans to be more disciplined to keep its opex growth in the single digit for fiscal 2025 to somewhat compensate for the higher capex. Besides, cash flow from operations surpassed $100 billion for the first time, reaching $119 billion for fiscal 2024, resulting in an attractive free cash flow (FCF) generation of approximately $74 billion, even after the escalated spending. Strong FCF generation characteristics render solid support for Microsoft’s capital spending plans. MSFT appears to have adequately addressed the concerns regarding its capex boost for fiscal 2025. It is now up to investors to take a deep, long look and decide if they are comfortable with the answers. Xbox content and services revenue increased 61% during the fourth quarter, of which 58 points were attributed to Activision. The acquisition of Activision has given Microsoft a strong content pipeline and a foothold in mobile gaming, a turf where it virtually had no presence before. In gaming, Microsoft now has more than 500 million monthly active users, across devices and platforms. Microsoft’s official cloud gaming service, Xbox Cloud Gaming, allows a user to play native console games in the cloud and stream it to a phone, PC, or console. The game catalog for Xbox Cloud Gaming has more than 200 titles including a number of EA Play games that make it quite appealing for users. Xbox Cloud Gaming is only available for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers, a service that costs $19.99 a month. For the first quarter, Xbox content and services revenue is expected to grow in the low to mid-50s percentage. Gaming could likely turn out to be a good revenue avenue, amid the projected growth in the global cloud gaming market from an estimated $5.8 billion in 2023 to $9.7 billion in 2024, thanks to the rise in mobile cloud gaming, according to Fortune Business Insights. Microsoft has made partnerships the cornerstone of its growth strategy. To understand the economic value partners realize through their collaboration with Microsoft and its technology—particularly with AI, IDC conducted a global study (commissioned by Microsoft). A key finding of this web-based global survey of 638 Microsoft partners was the “partner multiplier” metric. For every $1 of Microsoft revenue, Microsoft partners who provide services generate $8.45 and partners who develop software generate $10.93. This compelling number could spur further partner-led growth for MSFT. In its fourth-quarter earnings call, Microsoft noted that it “continues to prioritize security above all else.” It has more than 1.2 million security customers. “Defender for Cloud”—MSFT’s cloud security solutions for protecting customer workloads across multi-cloud and hybrid environments surpassed $1 billion in revenue for the past year (as of July 31, 2024). It is interesting that Nadella should reinforce MSFT’s commitment to prioritize security above all else. On July 18, cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike released a flawed software update, crashing millions of Windows devices. Microsoft pegged this estimate to 8.5 million Windows devices representing around 1% of all Windows machines. However, many of these customers were providers of critical services, like airlines and Banks. Although the outage was caused by the CrowdStrike update, Microsoft may likely face some pushback about the perceived chinks in its operating system. Of course, other risks include Microsoft not meeting its AI objectives and the subsequent repercussions that could stem from it. Cloud revenues and operating income for the latest June quarter: New data from Synergy Research Group, which tracks IT and cloud data, shows that second-quarter enterprise spending on cloud infrastructure services totaled $79 billion globally, up 22% year over year. Amazon remained the market leader during the June quarter with a 32% market share, followed by Microsoft at 23% and Google at 12%. Microsoft’s lead in generative AI and large language models (LLMs) is narrowing. Microsoft had a head-start advantage in the space through its investment in OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT. However, Amazon’s investment in Anthropic (the creator of Claude LLMs) and Google’s introduction of its Gemini model are leveling the playing field. Although ChatGPT remains the most popular chat-bot currently, experts opine that the offerings from Anthropic and Google have demonstrated superior performance vs. ChatGPT on various benchmarks. While Amazon and Google are playing catchup with ChatGPT, MSFT is adding its own in-house data center-bound AI chips, the Azure Maia 100 AI Accelerator for training and running AI models, and the Azure Cobalt 100 CPU, which is optimized for general purpose workloads. As of now, MSFT accounts for nearly 20% of Nvidia’s revenues, while Google and Amazon represent about 5% each. With its own AI chips, MSFT has the potential to close the much-touted cost advantage with AMZN and GOOG. In mid-September, MSFT announced a new $60 billion stock buyback program, aligning with its largest repurchase authorization to date. The new buyback authorization, which represents nearly 2% of MSFT’s market cap of $3.1 trillion, has no expiration date and replaces a $60 billion buyback program announced in 2021. Shareholder return initiatives are not new for Microsoft, which returned more than $34 billion to shareholders via dividends and buybacks in fiscal 2024. The company has repurchased shares consistently over the last two decades. However, the new buyback authorization does signal that the tech giant remains committed to robust free cash flow generation, despite its elevated AI-driven investments. Atop the battle for AI dominance, the top tech majors are also actively competing on buyback and dividend programs, which bodes well for shareholders. In May, Apple announced the biggest-ever $110 billion stock buyback authorization, following Google parent Alphabet’s $70 billion buyback authorization announcement in April. Microsoft ranks third so far this year in terms of buyback size. In February, Meta authorized an additional $50 billion in share repurchases, which represented 5% of its $1 trillion market cap at the time. Meta’s market cap has since grown by 50% to $1.5 trillion. Microsoft increased its quarterly dividend payout by 10% or 8 cents to $0.83 per share from the present $0.75 per share and made the announcement in mid-September along with the buyback plans. The dividend is payable to shareholders on December 12. MSFT stock goes ex-dividend– the cutoff date for new buyers of the stock to be eligible for the upcoming dividend–on November 21. At current stock prices, the new dividend has a forward yield of nearly 0.8%. Here’s a fun fact. Every year, the new quarterly dividend increase tops the year-ago dividend increase by a penny–a pattern that can be observed since November 2021. For example, the upcoming new dividend is $0.83 per share, a 8-cent increase from $0.75 per share in 2023, which is a 7-cent increase from $0.68 in 2022, and this represents a 6-cent increase from $0.62 in 2021. Microsoft has paid and grown its dividend for two decades now. This compares very favorably with the sector’s ten consecutive years of dividend payment and one year of dividend growth. Considering that Microsoft has consistently paid and increased dividends, there isn’t much in the way of surprises that would significantly impact MSFT stock behavior—unless Microsoft were to halt or cut its dividend payments. Such a move could serve as a notable negative catalyst, though the probability of that occurring is extremely low. Currently, Microsoft distributes more than 25% of its annual earnings as dividends, which seems safe and sustainable for now. Earnings reports, company developments and competitive dynamics have a stronger sway on MSFT’s stock price. Amid the pressure to show payoffs on their huge AI capital spending, other mega techs are turning more shareholder friendly. In February, Meta joined the throngs of Apple and Microsoft, by initiating its first-ever dividend of 50 cents per share, which would be paid on a quarterly basis. After the dividend announcement on February 1, META stock closed 20% higher on February 2. Google parent Alphabet initiated a cash dividend of 20 cents per share in April and the stock gained 10% the next day. Amazon is the only major tech that does not offer a dividend yet. Wall Street analysts are overwhelmingly bullish on the MSFT stock with an average price target of $496, which represents roughly an 18% upside from current stock price levels of around $420. MSFT stock has no Sell ratings and a few Hold ratings. Goldman Sachs (GS) maintains a Buy rating but reduced the price target on Microsoft to $500 from $515. GS expects 14% revenue growth for the first quarter, inline with the consensus, and sees EPS of $3.14, slightly above the consensus. Oppenheimer downgrades Microsoft to “Perform” From “Outperform,” citing higher-than-expected losses from Microsoft’s OpenAI investment and slower enterprise adoption of AI technology. Analysts at D.A. Davidson downgraded the stock to “Neutral” from “Buy,” keeping the price target unchanged at $475, citing concerns over the narrowing AI lead of Microsoft vs. rivals Google and Amazon, and MSFT’s heavy reliance on Nvidia for AI infrastructure. Jefferies is keeping its Buy rating, and price target unchanged at $550, citing the strong performance of Azure, and the promising trajectory of the M365 Copilot initiative. MSFT is 10% off its 52-week intraday high reached on July 5. After more than doubling in value over the past two years, a 10% correction in the MSFT stock is not exactly devastating. It could also be an opportunity to buy into a quality, futuristic business with the stock headed for new heights. In the near-term, there’s a very high likelihood of the Microsoft stock revisiting its highs, given an upcoming key catalyst, Microsoft’s first-quarter earnings report scheduled for release on October 30. In the longer run, AI is here to stay and is not going anywhere in a hurry. By building an evolving AI ecosystem around its products, MSFT is positioning itself as a major force within AI and cloud services. The market is in the “show me the money” mode. However, investors should remember that data centers cannot be built in a day and scaling up is a herculean task. Microsoft is definitely making progress and AI investments are already generating additional business for Microsoft, as can be seen by the strong signups for Azure AI and Microsoft 365 Copilot. Analysts expect $140 billion in incremental revenue from AI services for MSFT by 2027. Adding this to the fiscal 2024 revenue of $245 billion, Microsoft has the potential to reach a $4 trillion valuation by 2027 based on its five-year average price-to-sales ratio of 10.6x, representing 30% upside from current levels. Not to forget the long-term dividends and share buybacks that could further unlock value for investors. Microsoft stock is the top holding of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust. The Trust owns roughly $14.7 billion worth of Microsoft stock, representing about 30% of its $48 billion portfolio. Microsoft has been growing dividends and implementing buybacks over the last two decades. So, the recent buyback/dividend announcement is not expected to have much sway on the stock price. If the stock rallies, it could be attributed to the upcoming first-quarter earnings report slated for release on October 30. It appears that Microsoft has adequately addressed the concerns related to its capital spending in its fourth-quarter earnings call, expounding on the growing demand signals for Azure and Microsoft 365 Copilots and the variable, demand-driven nature of capex. Strong FCF generation characteristics render support to its capital spending plans. The revamp to its reporting structure will likely enhance visibility into its cloud consumption revenue and the benefits of AI on the overall business and ease any investor apprehensions. With growth in Xbox Content and Services revenue, gaming will likely shape up to a decent revenue stream as the global cloud gaming market gathers pace. Microsoft has the potential to reach a $4 trillion valuation by 2027, if all goes as planned.

Atypical of technology stocks, Microsoft has paid and grown its dividend for two decades. This compares favorably with the sector’s 10 consecutive years of dividend payment and one year of dividend growth. Microsoft has repurchased shares actively over the last two decades. In mid-September, MSFT announced a new $60 billion stock buyback program, aligning with its largest repurchase authorization to date. Stock buybacks reduce the number of shares outstanding and offset any dilutive impact for existing shareholders from a past stock offering or stock option exercise. Buyback announcements tend to push up the stock price but not always. Have any buybacks gone wrong?Pharma giant Merck’s shares lost 15% in the month, subsequent to the unveiling of its huge $10 billion buyback program on February 22, 2000. The selloff was because investors believed that the $10 billion could have been put to better use to bolster Merck’s drug pipeline that was running dry. Microsoft pays a dividend with a forward yield of 0.8%. The yield may look small, but that is because of the strong rally in the MSFT stock over the past years. Typically, investors buy the MSFT stock for its capital appreciation potential with lesser emphasis placed on the dividend.

Title: Mag 7 Become Drag 7, Taking Down QQQ & Create Opening For “Q Killers”

Full Content:
Lately, the Mag 7 Have Become the Drag 7 The Magnificent Seven, led by Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Meta, and Tesla helped major indices soar to new heights over the past decade. Since early February 2016, the S&P 500 has appreciated 265% while the QQQs nearly doubled that performance at 450%. Chief among the QQQ’s rise has been the tech heavy members of the Magnificent Seven (aka Mag 7). Each of the Mag 7 generated peak returns, that were in some cases, well above the 450% QQQ average. Standouts such as Nvidia (+21,280%), Tesla (+4000% peak return) and mega cap heavyweights, Apple (787% peak return), Microsoft (972% peak return) and Amazon (727% peak return) helped drive the exceptional performance. While the Mag 7 reached record levels, investors cheered. Who would publicly criticize a fund or index that produced exceptional results irrespective of disproportionate weights in only a handful of stocks? But what happens when these same 7 overweight stocks start to falter? Nothing good. The same Newtonian principles that drove stock prices and indexes higher, apply the same magic in reverse. Whatever goes up can come down. Seemingly overnight, the Mag 7 have become the Drag 7. Much of the appreciation occurs due to Market Cap weighted passive indices that do not easily change the mix of stocks or assigned weights. Consequently, as money flows into various funds, the index constituents are purchased automatically. This pushes the prices and market capitalizations of the stocks, and corresponding indices, higher. This is true irrespective of perceived valuation or price. There is no check or intervention as prices rise. And as more money flows in, the pace of appreciation and momentum rise even faster due to greater weight that the constituents hold. Passive indices hold to their prescribed rules and buy or sell in a pro rata fashion as dollars flow in or out. Although there are some benefits of a passive index, principally competitive, low fees and trading costs, there is an inherent flaw. There is generally no valuation overlay. And just as a few heavily weighted stocks can push an index higher as the prices go higher, the same will happen as heavily weighted stocks fall. This is what is happening now. Heavily weighted Mag 7 stocks are falling, due to active investors selling the stocks, and dragging major passive indices down. The cracks in the impenetrable Mag 7 base begin to appear around July 8, 2024. Since, that time period most of the Mag 7 have fallen. Though market dynamics can change at any time, this should be a concern for many investors in the future. The history of the Mag 7 began many years ago. For a long time the market leaders were referred to as the “FAANGs”. This acronym corresponded with: Facebook (before it became “Meta”), Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google. Notable among the missing constituents were Microsoft and Nvidia. This was before Nvidia was recognized as an AI leader. At the time, investors were bullish on Netflix as a Covid stock darling. After Covid, Netflix fell and the moniker “FAANGs” was replaced with the broader grouping of “Mag 7”. Microsoft and Nvidia were added and Netflix disappeared. The Mag 7 proved to be a more powerful mix than the FAANGS. Investors enjoyed a strong bull market rally, and with each year, as more money flowed to passive ETFs, a disproportionate percentage of the funds went back into the Mag 7. Their market capitalizations swelled. Several companies reached $1 trillion market capitalization (META) then quickly became $2 trillion companies (AMZN and GOOGL) and then even faster to $3 trillion market cap valuations (MSFT, AAPL, NVDA). Never before had massive companies reached $1 trillion levels, let alone $2 trillion and $3 trillion. Moreover, the moves beyond $1 trillion moved with unprecedented speed. Money flowed into index funds, which pushed stock prices higher, that continued to replenish a buying cycle that added more buying pressure, which in turn, increased the stock weights of the Mag 7. Today, only a handful of stocks represent a disproportionate percentage of the weight in indexes with 100 or even 1000 companies. This is dangerous for investors and it violates the basic underlying investment principle of diversification by not putting too many eggs in one basket. By way of example, only 3 stocks (AAPL, MSFT and NVDA) now comprise 35% of the Russell 1000 Growth index. This is far too heavy and can create major problems for investors when these three stocks drop. Moreover, more than 1/2 or approximately 54% of the Russell 1000 Index now resides in the Mag 7. Concentration can be a terrific thing when the Mag 7 are rising. For example, in 2023 the Russell 1000 Growth Index generated a return of 42.60% and the Mag 7 contributed 62% of the total performance. It was even more concentrated for the Invesco QQQ which generated a return of 54.85% with 68% of the performance originating from the Mag 7. However, the table below shows what can happen when the heavy concentration in the Mag 7 starts to falter. While the concentration is terrific when the stocks rise, it can be devastating when those stocks start to decline. This is the interesting characteristic that is happening to the Magnificent Seven lately. Some of the constituents are dropping and, more importantly, rather than creating wealth for investors, at least 5 of the 7 members, are starting to lose wealth. The table below illustrates. Magnificent 7 Performance Since July 8, 2024 to Oct 11, 2024 Since July 8, 2024 through October 11, 2024, five of the Mag 7 have fallen and the Tech heavy QQQ index has been negative (-0.66%). The worst performer since July 8, is TSLA (-13.89%), followed by GOOGL (-13.53%), MSFT (-10.55%), AMZN (-5.25%) and AAPL. This has far reaching ramifications for asset allocation among portfolio managers who currently invest in large capitalization, growth-oriented baskets. Despite holding hundreds of stocks in their funds, the preponderance of the equity weights reside among only a handful of securities. Perhaps, equally important, due to the heavy concentrations of just a few securities in an index, pension consultants and other fiduciaries, whose job it is to advise clients, may find that they may soon experience legal exposure by not better diversifying their clients’ portfolios. The Table below shows the performance of the QQQ relative to another Index with a similar correlation to Technology stocks, the Entrepreneur 30 Total Return Index (ER30TR). The ER30TR Index does not hold 4 (AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, TSLA) of the Mag 7 and is underweight 2 others (GOOGL, NVDA). In this particular case, the returns for the period July 8, 2024 through October 11, 2024 were a positive 6.7% for the ER30TR while negative 0.66% for the QQQ. (Note: past performance is no guide or guarantee of future performance). QQQ's Are Negative Since 07/08/2024 to Present (10/11/2024) The returns year to date (YTD) have shown similar results. While the QQQ have generated a solid 20.99% YTD, they fall below the 23.24% SPX (S&P 500) and pale next to the 41.63% for the Entrepreneur 30 (ER30TR). (Note: past performance is no guide or guarantee of future performance). Major Stock Indexes YTD (through Oct. 11, 2024) Moreover, in the context of longer periods, it is clear that the Invesco QQQ have prospered since January 2023. In the time period January 1, 2023 through October 11, 2024, the Invesco QQQ generated an impressive 87.25% return with exactly 2/3 of the return coming from the Mag 7. This is well above the SPX return of 55.22% and far above the 33.80% return for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. However, the performance could have been much better. As the table illustrates below, the Entrepreneur 30 Total Return Index provided a return of 122.22% during the same time period with a little over 1/3 of its total return coming from the Mag 7. Moreover, the Entrepreneur 30 TR Index had only 21% of its weight coming from the Mag 7 whereas the Mag 7 represent approximately 46% of the Invesco QQQ. In other words, despite the strong performance of the Mag 7, the Entrepreneur 30 TR Index provided 1.4X the return of the QQQ (122% vs 87%) with less than 1/2 the weight of the Mag 7 (compared to the QQQ) and less than 1/2 the performance coming from the Mag 7 (compared to the QQQ). (Note: past performance is no guide or guarantee of future performance). Major Index Performances Since 12/31/2022 Is it fair to compare an index with 30 holdings with an index that has 100 holdings? If the holdings were equal weighted, then the answer would be “no”. However, in the case of the Entrepreneur 30TR (ER30TR), the weights in the Mag 7 were only 21% vs 46% for the Invesco QQQ. This means that despite having more constituents in the Invesco QQQ, the weights in the Mag 7 were much more concentrated. Moreover, 2/3 of the total returns in the QQQ were from the Mag 7, whereas only 1/3 of the returns for the ER30TR were from the Mag 7. This means that it is possible to have fewer stocks in an Index, yet have less concentration and greater returns. As a result, many investors are now beginning to seek alternatives to the concentrated nature of the QQQ and Russell 1000 Growth. Could the ER30TR be the new replacement?(Note: past performance is no guarantee or guide to future returns). Overall returns, led by the Mag 7, have generated extraordinary returns for Tech heavy indices over the past few years. But concentration to just a handful of securities becomes dangerous when the heavily-weighted holdings begin to drop. Several popular indices, such as the Russell 1000 Growth and Invesco QQQ have seen their assets under management (AUM) ascend to hundreds of billions of dollars during the past few years. The Russell 1000 Growth is now approaching $100 Billion and the Invesco QQQ are nearing $300 Billion. With each index holding approximately 1/2 its weight in the Mag 7, this implies that 2 indices, control nearly $200 Billion of the Mag 7. Many other funds and indices, as well as private funds, pension funds, SMAs (separately managed accounts) control similar weights. This concentration can be devastating to investors as the Mag 7 decline. Investors are now seeking alternatives and discovering that it may be possible to achieve higher returns with less concentration—at least for certain periods of time. The QQQ have had an extraordinary growth record in raising AUM. If the concentrated Mag 7 continue to falter, replacement indices may soon become prevalent. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Please refer to the below disclosures: https://lnkd.in/e29X6rN
