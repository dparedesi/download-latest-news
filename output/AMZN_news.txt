If you’ve been researching investment options for building long-term wealth, chances are you’ve come across the term “VTSAX.” It’s one of the most recommended mutual funds among financial experts and personal finance communities. But what exactly is VTSAX, how does it work, and is it the right investment for you? In this comprehensive guide, we break down everything you need to know about VTSAX in simple terms. Whether you’re a beginner or just looking to understand this fund better, this article is designed to help you make an informed investment decision. Contents VTSAX stands for Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund Admiral Shares. It is a low-cost mutual fund offered by Vanguard, one of the largest investment companies in the world. VTSAX is designed to give investors exposure to the entire U.S. stock market in a single investment. This means that when you invest in VTSAX, you own a tiny piece of over 4,000 publicly traded U.S. companies – from large corporations like Apple and Microsoft to small-cap stocks you’ve probably never heard of. The popularity of VTSAX boils down to a few key benefits: VTSAX uses a passive investing strategy. It aims to mirror the performance of the CRSP US Total Market Index, which includes nearly all U.S. stocks across various sectors and market capitalizations (large-cap, mid-cap, small-cap, and micro-cap). Instead of trying to beat the market like actively managed funds do, VTSAX simply tracks it. This strategy leads to lower trading costs, minimal turnover, and greater tax efficiency. VTSAX holds thousands of companies across a wide range of industries. Some of the top holdings include: These top holdings typically make up a larger percentage of the fund due to their market capitalization. Many investors compare VTSAX vs VTI because both offer exposure to the total U.S. stock market. The main differences are: Functionally, both are nearly identical in terms of holdings, performance, and expense ratio. VTSAX is ideal for: However, it may not be suitable for short-term traders or those looking for high-risk, high-reward investments. To invest in VTSAX, you typically need to: You can also set up automatic investments and dividend reinvestment plans (DRIP) for VTSAX. One of the biggest advantages of VTSAX is its low expense ratio of 0.04%. That means you pay just $4 annually for every $10,000 invested. This low fee helps more of your money stay invested and grow over time. There are no load fees or commission fees when buying directly through Vanguard. While past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, VTSAX has historically performed in line with the overall U.S. stock market. Over the long term (10+ years), the average annual return has been approximately 7-10% depending on market conditions. During bull markets, VTSAX tends to rise steadily, and during bear markets, it will decline, but not as drastically as individual stocks. VTSAX pays quarterly dividends that can be reinvested or taken as cash. These dividends come from the profits of the companies in the fund and can provide passive income, especially over time as your investment grows. Dividend yield typically ranges from 1.2% to 2.0%, depending on market conditions. Like all investments, VTSAX carries some risk: Here’s how VTSAX compares to similar total market funds: VTSAX is one of the best all-in-one investment options available today. It combines simplicity, low costs, and broad diversification, making it an excellent choice for investors who want to grow wealth steadily over the long term. Whether you’re saving for retirement, building a nest egg, or just starting out, VTSAX offers a reliable path toward financial independence. If you’re looking for a single fund that provides exposure to the entire U.S. economy with minimal effort and fees, VTSAX is hard to beat. FAQs About VTSAX Is VTSAX good for beginners? Yes.

Title: Microsoft is stealing Amazon's thunder in the cloud — and AI

With almost $10 trillion in combined market cap across Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), and Meta (META), last week’s Big Tech earnings weren’t just dry corporate updates. They were market-moving events. And despite a few wobbles, the takeaway is clear: AI momentum and operational efficiency are driving a new wave of tech profitability, even as tariffs loom and economic uncertainty lingers. Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the widening gap between Wall Street and Main Street, the shift to AI-powered enterprise is shaping up as the gold rush of this decade. Microsoft led the charge, with the stock jumping more than 11% for the week, fueled by surging cloud and AI demand — and management’s clear, detailed take on both in the earnings call. Amazon, for its part, whipsawed before and after its earnings report, but closed the week up about 1%, buoyed by strong margin growth. Only Apple stock slipped, falling 2% as investors weighed a cautious June quarter outlook and a potential $900 million tariff hit. Together, the releases and earnings calls painted a nuanced but largely bullish picture of where Big Tech is headed — and how it’s already reshaping both the market and the macro narrative. If there was one company that seized the AI narrative last week, it was Microsoft. The company delivered a blowout quarter — and an even more confident call — that made clear it’s not just riding the AI boom, but helping define it. Azure cloud revenue grew 33% year-over-year, reaccelerating from the previous quarter and beating both internal targets and Wall Street estimates. Almost half of that growth came from AI workloads — a level of transparency that reinforced Microsoft’s clout in the enterprise AI stack. CEO Satya Nadella and CFO Amy Hood leaned into the idea that AI and non-AI workloads are increasingly indistinguishable, especially among digital-native customers building everything on unified infrastructure. Microsoft’s $80 billion forecast for fiscal 2025 capital expenditures remains intact, with plans to expand further in 2026 — quieting any talk of a slowdown in data center investment. Wedbush called it an “Aaron Judge-like quarter” and raised its price target 8.4% to $515. Crucially, Microsoft didn’t just post strong results — it articulated a confident, forward-looking vision of how AI is already translating into revenue. In a week where every tech CEO had to tell an AI story, Microsoft made its pitch look not just polished, but inevitable. Amazon’s first-quarter results were strong by the numbers: Revenue rose 9% to $155.7 billion, net income rose to $1.59 per share, and operating margins hit a record 11.8%, largely on the back of AWS, Amazon’s profit engine. But with initiatives spanning AI chips, Alexa upgrades, Project Kuiper satellites, Prime Day savings on snail-mucin moisturizers, and even a new James Bond film, Amazon remains a catch-all for tech’s most ambitious threads — which may make its story harder to parse for investors. CEO Andy Jassy emphasized Amazon’s ability to thrive even in a softening economy, pointing to consumer demand strength, faster Prime delivery, and $500 million in customer savings during global sales events. He struck a confident tone on AWS as well, convincinly describing it as a “multi-hundred-billion-dollar” opportunity over time. Still, the cloud business grew just 17% year-over-year — solid, especially off a large base, but slower than Azure’s 33%, and short of the expectations that Microsoft’s blowout quarter had quietly raised. Analysts flagged uncertainty around near-term earnings power, as well as questions about potential tariff impacts and the timeline for Kuiper’s returns. As Deutsche Bank (DB) put it, Amazon’s sheer scale helps it weather global disruption — but that same sprawl can make it tough to gauge momentum or profitability with precision. AWS remains the largest cloud provider — a position it’s held for over a decade, a default authority — and management cited capacity constraints as a limiting factor, though relief may come in the second half of the year. Certainly, the stakes couldn’t be higher. As Jassy noted, we’re still in the early innings of enterprise’s move to the cloud — and that migration is accelerating, powered by AI. Enterprise tech may be the biggest market opportunity of this era, and in that context, “lumpy revenue” is both expected and fair. But with Microsoft setting the pace and reframing what success looks like, Amazon’s longtime dominance feels just a bit less assured. In the meantime, Amazon is betting that its everything-now strategy will pay off later. Of course, this isn’t a zero-sum game: The enterprise AI market is big enough to crown multiple winners, and both Microsoft and Amazon will undoubtedly be among the biggest. But in a moment where narrative clarity matters, Microsoft pulled ahead. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos will sell billions of dollars in Amazon stock over the next year, according to a regulatory filing. The former Amazon CEO and current executive chair will sell up to 25 million shares between now and May 2026, according to the SEC disclosure, which was made publicly available Friday. The value of those transactions would amount to about $4.8 billion at Amazon’s current stock price. The filing says Bezos adopted the plan in March. The disclosure comes a day after Amazon reported its first-quarter earnings. Net sales rose 9% to $155.7 billion, while net income reached $17.1 billion, or $1.59 per share, easily topping Wall Street’s forecast of $1.37 earnings per share. Amazon’s North American sales came in at $92.9 billion and international sales hit $33.5 billion, climbing 8% and 5% over last year, respectively. AWS posted $29.3 billion in revenue, with segment operating income climbing to $11.5 billion — suggesting that demand for cloud and AI workloads remains strong. Ad sales also surpassed estimates, rising 19% year-over-year. Still, Amazon shares were up only 0.2%, to 190.62, on Friday afternoon. The stock is down 13.5% since the start of the year. Bezos unloaded about $13.5 billion worth of Amazon stock last year, the first time he’d sold his shares since 2021. That included 50 million shares in the span of nine trading days in February 2024 and another 25 million shares in July, when the stock was near its all-time high. The timing of those sales coincided with Bezos’ full-time move from the Seattle area, where Amazon is headquartered, to Florida. If he still lived in Washington state, where a 7% capital gains tax was enacted in 2022, those transactions would have cost Bezos nearly $945 million. Bezos didn’t mention Washington state’s new capital gains tax as a reason for his move. But while living there, the billionaire didn’t sell any Amazon stock in 2022 or 2023 after the tax was enacted, Fortune reported. —Catherine Baab and Bruce Gil contributed to this article.

Title: Watch These Amazon Stock Price Levels After Company Issues Soft Outlook

Amazon (AMZN) wavered between gains and losses Friday after the e-commerce and cloud computing giant issued a cautious outlook amid uncertainty about the economy, offsetting strong quarterly results. During the company’s earnings call, CEO Andy Jassy told analysts the company hasn’t seen any significant impact from tariffs denting consumer demand or sellers setting product pricing, but cautioned that may change. He also said that Amazon has remained proactive to keep prices low. Amazon shares had lost 13% since the start of the year through Thursday's close and dropped 22% from their record high established in early February, weighed down by concerns that the company could get caught in the crosshairs of a protracted U.S.- China trade war. The stock was up about 1% at $192 in early-afternoon trading Friday, recovering from losses earlier in the session. Below, we break down the technicals on Amazon’s chart and point out key post-earnings price levels worth monitoring. Since bottoming out last month, Amazon shares have consolidated within a rising wedge. More recently, the price has rallied toward the wedge’s top trendline and 50-day moving average (MA), a move that has coincided with the relative strength index (RSI) crossing back into bullish territory. Let’s identify several key support and resistance levels on Amazon’s chart that will likely gain investors’ attention. A decisive breakdown below the rising wedge pattern's lower trendline could see the shares drop to around $170. This area on the chart would likely provide support near the late-April low and the trough of a minor pullback to the 200-day MA last August. Selling below this level brings lower support at $152 into play. Bargain hunters could seek buying opportunities at a location near last year’s early August sell-off low. This region also roughly aligns with a projected bars pattern downside target that extracts the trend lower that preceded the rising wedge and repositions it from the pattern’s top trendline, speculating where the shares may be headed if a continuation move lower plays out. A breakout above the rising wedge pattern’s top trendline would likely see the stock test overhead resistance near $199. The shares may run into selling pressure in this area near a horizontal line that connects a range of corresponding trading activity on the chart extending back to early July last year. Finally, a more bullish move higher in Amazon shares could propel a move up to $216. Investors who bought at lower levels may see this as high probability area to place sell orders near the stock’s November peak and January trough.

Title: Is Amazon Stock A Buy At $190?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. Building a platform to do the job of 1 million analysts ByTrefis Team, Contributor. 29 April 2025, Bavaria, Munich: The logo and lettering of the global online mail order company ... More Amazon can be seen under the blue sky on the façade of Amazon Germany's headquarters in Parkstadt Schwabing in Munich (Bavaria) on April 29, 2025. Photo: Matthias Balk/dpa (Photo by Matthias Balk/picture alliance via Getty Images) Amazon stock (NASDAQ: AMZN) declined approximately 3% in after-market trading Thursday following the company’s March quarter results. While the company beat overall sales and earnings expectations, its cloud revenue came in at $29.27 billion, falling short of the anticipated $29.42 billion. Separately, see 1 Metric More Scary Than U.S. Trade Deficit Or Debt. The company’s Q2 outlook presented a mixed picture. Sales forecasts of $161.5 billion slightly exceeded analyst expectations of $161.2 billion, but projected operating income of $15.3 billion fell significantly below the consensus estimate of $17.6 billion. Amazon’s management acknowledged uncertainties around tariffs but reported no current slowdown in demand. Now, if you are looking for an upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. These kinds of diversified investment options may provide a buffer against the volatility that single stocks like Amazon could experience amid economic uncertainties. The moderate stock decline occurs against a backdrop of increasing economic challenges. The U.S. economy contracted in Q1 2025, and President Trump’s recently implemented tariffs on key trading partners raise inflation concerns. In an environment of slowing economic growth, these pressures could lead companies to cut costs, potentially impacting cloud spending. This would negatively affect AWS, Amazon's most profitable business segment. Furthermore, a significant portion of products sold on Amazon's marketplace are sourced from China. The implementation of higher tariffs would likely force Amazon and its third-party sellers to raise prices for consumers. This price inflation could dampen consumer purchasing power and overall demand, potentially impacting Amazon's core e-commerce revenue. While Amazon has a diversified supply chain, the scale of Chinese imports makes the company particularly vulnerable to escalating trade tensions. Despite these challenges, AMZN stock currently trades at 3.1x trailing revenues, in line with its four-year average P/S ratio of 3.2x. However, the growing AWS business is improving Amazon's overall profitability, suggesting the stock deserves a higher valuation multiple than its historical average. With the stock now down over 20% from February highs, we believe tariff-related risks are somewhat priced in. We consider AMZN a strong long-term investment opportunity at prices around $190. Still, investing in a single stock like AMZN can be risky. On the other hand, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index, less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
