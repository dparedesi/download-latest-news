In the financial services industry, analysts need to switch between structured data (such as time-series pricing information), unstructured text (such as SEC filings and analyst reports), and audio/visual content (earnings calls and presentations). Each format requires different analytical approaches and specialized tools, creating workflow inefficiencies. Add on top of this the intense time pressure resulting from rapidly evolving industry conditions and narrow decision windows. Delayed analysis can mean missed opportunities or failure to identify emerging risks, with potentially significant financial consequences. AI-assistants boost productivity by automating routine data collection and processing tasks, surfacing relevant insights, and allowing analysts to focus on higher-value activities. However, a single AI agent struggles with complex, multistep investment research workflows to effectively handle the full spectrum of multiple specialized tasks. This is where multi-agent collaboration provides an advancement. By creating specialized AI subagents that excel in specific tasks and functionalities and using them together under a coordinated framework using an AI supervisor agent, we can address the full complexity of investment research workflows. A supervisor agent can intelligently decompose complex queries, delegate specialized tasks to subagents, and synthesize their outputs into comprehensive answers—similar to how a research team functions in the real world. The benefits of this approach are substantial, stemming from distributed problem-solving and specialization, improved accuracy through specialized expertise, enhanced scalability by adding new agent capabilities without rebuilding the entire system, and greater transparency because the reasoning process of each specialized agent can be tracked and verified. Amazon Bedrock Agents uses the reasoning of foundation models (FMs), APIs, and data to break down user requests, gather relevant information, and efficiently complete tasks. With the multi-agent collaboration capability of Amazon Bedrock, you can build, deploy, and manage multiple AI agents working together on complex multistep tasks that require specialized skills. Amazon Bedrock Data Automation (BDA) enables the generation of useful insights from unstructured multimodal content such as documents, images, audio, and video for your AI-powered applications, and it can be used as a parser when setting up a knowledge base for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) workflows. In this post, we walk through how to build a multi-agent investment research assistant using the multi-agent collaboration capability of Amazon Bedrock. Our solution demonstrates how a team of specialized AI agents can work together to analyze financial news, evaluate stock performance, optimize portfolio allocations, and deliver comprehensive investment insights—all orchestrated through a unified, natural language interface. We use BDA as a parser when setting up a knowledge base for RAG workflows with multi-modal data. Amazon Nova understanding models are used as the large language models (LLMs) associated with the supervisor agents and subagents. Check the video that demonstrates the solution, Results from these agents are demonstrative, not to be taken as financial advice. The multi-agent investment research assistant is composed of a supervisor agent and three subagents (quantitative analysis agent, news agent, and smart summarizer agent) working together in a coordinated framework, as shown in the following diagram. The supervisor agent uses the instructions you provide to understand the structure and role of each collaborator agent. The supervisor agent orchestrates the overall investment research process by breaking down user prompts, delegating subtasks to specialized subagents, and consolidating their outputs to generate the final response. Each subagent is configured to carry out specialized tasks as follows: Multi-agent collaboration works as follows: This architecture uses the strengths of the different specialized agents to comprehensively address the various aspects of investment research, and the supervisor agent provides the intelligent orchestration. The following diagram is the technical architecture. Some of the key components and the associated codes of the technical architecture are: To deploy this solution, attach the appropriate permissions for Amazon Bedrock, AWS Lambda, Amazon OpenSearch Serverless, Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), and AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) to your execution role. You also need to deploy two AWS CloudFormation stacks: web_search and stock_data. For more information on the permission policy, CloudFormation stacks, and setting up the environment, refer to the README.md in the investment_research_agent repository on GitHub. To dive deeper into the solution and the code shown in this post, refer to the investment research assistant agent GitHub repo. The repo contains instructions for the end-to-end solution, including setting up the supervisor agent and subagents, associated action groups, unstructured data (earnings reports PDF files and earnings call audio files), and structured data (stocks time series). In the appendix at the end of this post, we share different questions asked by a financial analyst to the supervisor agent, the subagent invoked, and the answers from the supervisor agent. To clean up this solution, make sure to delete all agents, knowledge bases, and associated Amazon OpenSearch Serverless instances. Delete both the web_search and stock_data stacks. This will make sure that no charges are incurred after you’re finished testing this solution. Read the associated notebook in the GitHub repository for more instructions on cleaning up the agents. The multi-agent investment research assistant built using Amazon Bedrock Agents with its multi-agent collaboration feature represents how financial professionals can use AI to enhance their analytical capabilities. By using specialized agents—each focusing on distinct aspects of financial analysis—orchestrated by a supervisor agent, we’ve created a system that can process diverse data types, apply appropriate analytical techniques, and synthesize comprehensive insights in response to complex investment queries. The result is an AI assistant that can handle multistep financial analysis workflows that would otherwise overwhelm a single-agent system. The application of multi-agent collaboration extends broadly across the financial sector, from equity research and portfolio management to risk assessment and compliance monitoring. A complex financial workflow that requires multiple specialized skills and data sources can benefit from this architectural approach. The implementation uses key AWS services, including Amazon Bedrock for foundation models, the multi-agent collaboration capability of Amazon Bedrock Agents, Amazon S3 for document storage, Amazon OpenSearch Serverless for vector search capabilities, and Lambda functions for specialized actions. This serverless architecture provides scalability, and the knowledge base integration provides context from financial documents to ground the AI’s responses in factual data.

Title: Billionaire Bill Ackman Pours $1,039,000,000 Into Single Asset in Major Portfolio Shift: Report

Billionaire Bill Ackman’s hedge fund, Pershing Square Capital, has reportedly exited a position that previously accounted for 8.7% of the firm’s holdings. Pershing Square has sold $1.039 billion worth of shares in the railway company Canadian Pacific (CP.TO), reports Reuters. Ackman says he sold the Canadian Pacific position “with regret,” after rebuying the stock in 2022. He also says he has a “a very strong belief in the long-term future of the business.” But Ackman made the portfolio change to free up cash to pour into online retail giant Amazon (AMZN). Says Ryan Israel, Pershing Square’s chief investment officer, in an investor conference call, “We felt that the company would be able to work through any slowdown in the cloud computing division Amazon Web Services and we did not judge that tariffs would have a material impact on the earnings in the retail business.” Ackman and his team say Amazon CEO Andrew Jassy has the business acumen to put the retail giant in a position to witness “more profit margin expansion at a high rate of revenue growth.” Pershing Square also gobbled up shares in car rental company Hertz (HTZ.O) and transport giant Uber (UBER.N). AMZN stock closed Friday’s trading session at $200.99, down more than 1% on the day.
