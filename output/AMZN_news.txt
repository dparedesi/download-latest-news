An "indefinite future" refers to a time that is not clearly defined, determined, or specific. It's kind of like the old Johnny Mathis song "The Twelfth of Never" only without the music, but the idea is the same: Don't hold your breath. üíµüí∞Don't miss the move: Subscribe to TheStreet's free daily newsletter üí∞ Nvidia (NVDA) got that message earlier this month when the U.S. government told the AI-chipmaking colossus that it would need to obtain a license to export its H20 chips to China, including Hong Kong and Macao. As a result, Nvidia said it expects to take a $5.5 billion charge in its fiscal 2026 first quarter due to H20 chip inventory, purchase commitments, and associated reserves. "The USG informed the Company that the license requirement will be in effect for the indefinite future," Nvidia said in a regulatory filing. Nvidia shares are down 17.4% in 2025 as the Santa Clara, CA-based tech giant got whacked a series of unfortunate events, starting with the arrival of DeepSeek, the Chinese AI company the produces large language models (LLMs) that are a lot cheaper than its competitors. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has seen his company's shares slide. Then, President Donald Trump announced his global tariff agenda that pushed levies on Chinese goods to 145%. China raised its reciprocal tariffs to 125% for all goods originating from the United States in response to Trump‚Äôs move. Trump later said the tariffs levied against China were going to be substantially decreased. Nvidia's stock took another drubbing after reports emerged that Chinese tech titan Huawei was ramping up production of its AI chips, potentially impacting Nvidia's market share in China. More Nvidia: Nvidia has been the dominant player in the Chinese AI chip market, but U.S. export restrictions have limited the company's ability to supply their most advanced chips. Huawei is looking to capitalize on the restrictions by offering a competitive AI chip to the Chinese market. Huawei plans to begin mass shipments of its advanced 910C artificial intelligence chip to Chinese customers as early as next month, according to Reuters. The timing is fortuitous for Chinese AI companies which have been left scrambling for domestic alternatives to Nvidia H20. So, all in all, it's probably fair to say that, so far, 2025 hasn't been a banner year for Nvidia. But there's some good new on the horizon. China appears to have rolled back their retaliatory tariffs of 125% on some semiconductors made in the US, CNN reported on April 25. The exemptions, which have not been officially announced, apply to integrated circuits, also known as microchips or semiconductors. In addition to semiconductors, China has decided to grant exemptions on some aircraft parts, including engines and landing gear. While China has made strides in developing its own semiconductor industry, it is still highly dependent on imports of chips and chipmaking equipment from the U.S., Taiwan, South Korea, Japan and the Netherlands. Last year, China imported $11.7 billion worth of semiconductors from the U.S. Meanwhile, Nvidia and Amazon (AMZN) executives said that the construction of artificial intelligence data centers is not slowing down, as recession fears have some investors questioning whether tech companies will pull back on some of their plans, according to CNBC. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs been really no significant change,‚Äù Kevin Miller, Amazon‚Äôs vice president of global data centers, said at a conference organized by the Hamm Institute for American Energy. ‚ÄúWe continue to see very strong demand, and we‚Äôre looking both in the next couple years as well as long term and seeing the numbers only going up.‚Äù Miller said ‚Äúthere‚Äôs been little tea leaf reading and extrapolating to strange results‚Äù about Amazon‚Äôs plans. Nvidia, which reports quarterly results on May 28, is also not seeing signs of a slowdown, said Josh Parker, the chipmaker‚Äôs senior director of corporate sustainability. He added that Nvidia sees compute and energy demand only rising due to AI, describing the reaction to DeepSeek as ‚Äúkneejerk.‚Äù Morgan Stanley analysts are worried about an AI slow down. The firm lowered its price target on Nvidia to $160 from $162 while keeping an overweight rating on the shares. As investor sentiment is worsening based on macro and supply chain risks, Morgan Stanley said, core demand for GPUs has shot higher in the last four weeks amid a shortage of inference chips across most of the relevant LLMs, in all geographies. Morgan said that the idea that "we are in a digestion phase for AI is laughable given the obvious need for more inference chips which is driving a wave of very strong demand." ‚ÄúWhile Wall Street is wringing its hands over a laundry list of very real concerns, Silicon Valley focus has shifted to a very different challenge ‚Äî growth in tokens generated of (by some accounts) more than 5X since the beginning of the year is very much straining the ecosystem and is driving a surge in investment to handle these workloads," the firm said. Near-term estimates are capped by export controls and still limited by Blackwell supply, referring to Nvidia's new line of processors, but that is ramping quickly, the firm said. Morgan Stanley said Nvidia remains a top pick. Want TheStreet‚Äôs best daily stock and investing news right in your inbox every weekday? Get our free flagship newsletter.

U.S. stock futures are little changed as markets enter the week on a four-session winning streak and investors prepare for a crowded earnings calendar, including reports from Magnificent Seven firms Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta Platforms (META); Domino's Pizza (DPZ) shares are fall in premarket trading after the company reported weaker-than-expected U.S. same-store sales; German drug giant Merck KGaA agrees to buy U.S. biotech SpringWorks Therapeutics (SWTX) for nearly $4 billion; and shares of Deliveroo soar in London trading after DoorDash (DASH) makes an offer to acquire the British food delivery service. Here's what investors need to know today. U.S. stock futures are edging lower as investors get ready for a busy week of earnings and economic data amid a four-session winning streak for the major indexes. Nasdaq futures are down 0.1% after the tech-favored index added 6.7% last week, while S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures also are slightly lower after gaining last week. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is rising to trade over $95,000. Yields on the 10-year Treasury note are rising slightly. Oil futures are lower. Gold futures are little changed. More than half of the Magnificent Seven companies are scheduled to report quarterly results this week, with Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta Platforms (META) all on this week's calendar. Apple's earnings on Thursday come as the iPhone maker has shed 16% of its value this year on concerns over how U.S. tariffs on China will impact the company. Also reporting on Thursday is Amazon, whose stock was recently downgraded due to its exposure to Chinese tariffs. Microsoft and Meta Platform report Wednesday, with the latter's coming as the Instagram parent faces a Federal Trade Commission antitrust court case. Shares of Domino's Pizza (DPZ) are slipping about 2.5% in premarket trading after the company reported weaker-than-expected first-quarter revenue and U.S. same-store sales. The Ann Arbor, Mich.-based company's revenue of $1.11 billion was slightly lower than the consensus of analysts polled by Visible Alpha, while its earnings per share of $4.33 came in above estimates. Same-store sales among Domino's U.S. locations fell by 0.5% year-over-year, worse than the 0.22% bump analysts had forecast. Shares of U.S. biotech SpringWorks Therapeutics (SWTX) are rising more than 3% in premarket trading after German drug company Merck KGaA said it has struck a deal to buy the firm for around $3.9 billion. Merck said it would offer $47 a share in cash for the Stamford, Conn.-based firm. That represents a 26% premium to SpringWorks' 20-day volume-weighted average price of $37.38 on Feb. 7‚Äîthe day before speculation of a potential deal between the two started, Merck said. SpringWorks shares closed at $44.72 on Friday. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2025. Deliveroo shares are jumping 17% in London trading after DoorDash (DASH) offered to buy the British food delivery firm for 180 pence ($2.40) per share. Deliveroo, which said it had received an "indicative proposal" from DoorDash on April 5, added its board indicated to the U.S. company that "should a firm offer be made" at those terms, it "would be minded to recommend such an offer to Deliveroo shareholders." Shares of DoorDash are little changed in premarket trading.

Title: What Analysts Think of Amazon Stock Ahead of Earnings

Amazon (AMZN) is expected to release first-quarter results after the closing bell on Thursday, with analysts bullish on the online retail and tech giant. All 26 analysts tracked by Visible Alpha who follow the company rate Amazon's stock as a "buy," with every analyst holding a price target above the stock's current levels. The average price target is around $241, a premium of about 29% to Tuesday's close but down from about $259 ahead of last quarter's report. Amazon is expected to report $155 billion in revenue for the first quarter, up 8% from the first quarter a year ago. Adjusted earnings per share are expected to rise to $1.75 from $1.46 the same time last year. Amazon shares have declined about 15% since the start of the year, amid a tariff-fueled market sell-off that has hit the Magnificent Seven hard. Analysts will likely seek more information about Amazon's plans to keep up with the spending pace of its artificial intelligence rivals. But Wall Street's attention is also focused on the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs. Amazon stock was downgraded earlier this month by Raymond James analysts who said tariffs on China could hurt Amazon's profit margins and lead to a pullback in advertising revenue from sellers on the platform who rely on Chinese imports. Morgan Stanley analysts wrote recently that they estimate 18% of products on Amazon are imported from China, and that roughly 60% of third-party sellers on the platform have "some China exposure" that could affect ad spending plans. UPDATE‚ÄîApril 29, 2025: This article has been updated since it was first published to reflect more recent analyst estimates and share price values.
