Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Drew Angerer / Getty Images Just as we grew accustomed to the likelihood of a third federal rate cut in December, some inflation data and a host of other factors led some on Wall Street to call for the Federal Reserve to hold off in December and perhaps wait until the first meeting in 2026. However, last week, we witnessed the most alarming piece of data we had seen in some time: a staggering 153,074 job cuts, the highest in over two decades, driven by the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) and cost-cutting measures. Major tech and retail giants, including Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), UPS (NYSE: UPS), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), and Target (NYSE: TGT), have announced significant layoffs. This in turn sparked Federal Reserve Governor Steven Miran to make a forceful case for a half-percentage-point interest rate reduction at the Federal Open Market Committee’s December meeting, arguing that recent economic indicators justify more aggressive monetary easing. Governor Miran went on to add that core PCE inflation has declined substantially toward the Fed’s 2% target while unemployment has ticked upward in recent months. He emphasized that the central bank should move preemptively to support economic momentum rather than risk waiting too long and allowing conditions to deteriorate further, while acknowledging that some of his colleagues on the committee prefer a more cautious quarter-point approach. He also said this: “A 50 basis point reduction would still leave us in restrictive territory, but it would demonstrate our commitment to achieving both sides of our dual mandate.” One thing is sure: if the Fed were to implement a 50-basis-point increase, it would likely come as a shock to the market and could ignite an end-of-year Santa Claus rally. Now is the perfect time to buy our four favorite 7% dividend stocks, all of which are Buy-rated at top Wall Street firms we follow. relif / Getty Images Since 1926, dividends have contributed approximately 32% of the total return for the S&P 500, while capital appreciation has contributed 68%. Therefore, sustainable dividend income and capital appreciation potential are essential for total return expectations. A study by Hartford Funds, in collaboration with Ned Davis Research, found that dividend stocks have delivered an annualized return of 9.18% over the past 50 years (1973-2023). Over the same timeline, this was more than double the annualized return for non-payers (3.95%). Altria Group Inc.

This stock offers value investors a compelling entry point, along with a generous dividend yield of 7.09%. Altria manufactures and sells smokable and oral tobacco products in the United States. The company’s dividend payout is based on free cash flow, ranging from about 64% to 80% per quarter. In recent quarters, free cash flow has exceeded dividend payments, providing a solid buffer.

Altria used to own over 10% of Anheuser-Busch InBev S.A. (NYSE: BUD), the world’s largest brewer. Last year, the company sold 35 million of its 197 million shares through a global secondary offering.

Title: Why These Wall Street Experts Expect Big Things From Nvidia's Earnings Report Next Week

Nvidia (NVDA) is set to report its latest earnings after the market closes next Wednesday, and analysts are expecting big things. Analysts from Jefferies and Wedbush have each said in recent notes that they expect the artificial intelligence giant to "beat and raise," or report better financial metrics than analysts have projected and lift their future forecasts. "Hyperscale capex spending results for Q3 generally exceeded expectations," Wedbush analysts wrote, maintaining their $210 price target. "More importantly, the large hyperscalers nearly ubiquitously talked to an expectation of increasing spending trends into future periods as they continue to expand investment to support their AI efforts." Nvidia shares closed nearly 2% higher on Friday at around $190. The stock has gained 42% since the start of the year, far outpacing the gains of the benchmark S&P 500 index. Nvidia is the most valuable company on the market today, meaning its stock likely has an outsized impact on your portfolio, and potentially your retirement. The chipmaker's performance in quarterly earnings can affect the stock prices of a range of companies involved in the AI sector. The Wedbush analysts said that much of the growth in spending from "hyperscalers" such as Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) seems to end up being funneled to Nvidia, as the chipmaker "supplies a disproportionate amount of the AI server value." However, some investors and analysts are starting to question how much the biggest tech companies should be willing to spend before they see a clearer path to getting a return on their investment into AI. Meanwhile, many market participants have been looking for signs of a bubble. Bank of America analysts, keeping their price target at $275, said they expect Nvidia executives to reassure investors about their ability to meet demand, and said the company is facing high earnings expectations and growing skepticism around AI spending. Nvidia is expected to report adjusted earnings per share of $1.26 on revenue of $55.28 billion, each up more than 55% from the same time a year ago, according to estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. Data center revenue, the chips Nvidia sells that other companies buy to train and run a variety of AI models, is expected to grow 61% and make up $49.53 billion of Nvidia's revenue. Oppenheimer analysts lifted their price target for Nvidia earlier this week, calling the chipmaker the single company that is "best positioned to win" in the AI sector.
