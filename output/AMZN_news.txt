Title: Wall Street Is Worried About an AI Bubble—Here's the Sector Where Stock Prices Really Stand Out

AI boom or AI bubble? That's been one of the most pressing debates on Wall Street of late. Some investors see echoes of the Dotcom Bubble in Nvidia's (NVDA) and OpenAI's recent circular dealmaking bonanza and soaring stock prices. Others note the AI boom is being financed by hugely profitable tech companies, whose valuations aren't nearly as high as their Dotcom peers. As Big Tech's AI spending has ballooned, so have the ranks of companies claiming a piece of the pie. The AI buildout has turbocharged the sales of unsexy, slow-and-steady businesses and transformed their stocks into buzzy growth names. It has also juiced the stocks of nascent companies that are years from self-sufficiency, creating pockets of exceptional froth within a pricey AI ecosystem. The stocks that gain the most during sharp market rallies are often the stocks that, when sentiment turns negative, have the farthest to fall. That is especially true of young companies that, without substantial sales, rely on debt and equity markets to fund their growth. To understand where the AI trade has become most bubbly, Investopedia identified 75 companies regularly referred to as "AI beneficiaries" by Wall Street analysts, and sorted each into one of five categories: cloud computing providers; semiconductor makers; software companies; power providers; and networking, storage, and cooling equipment makers. A few companies, like Microsoft (MSFT), fit in multiple categories, in which case we've placed them in the one that feels most central to their AI business today. At present, Microsoft's cloud revenue is the best metric for assessing its AI business, so it's classified as a cloud provider instead of a software company. All five categories have seen their valuations rise over the past few years, but none more than power providers. The median price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of our power basket in 2025 is 4.53, nearly three times the median in 2023 (1.52). The next largest P/S expansions over that period were in networking, storage and cooling (4.45 in 2025 vs. 2.09 in 2023) and cloud providers (10.5 vs 6.34). (Cloud providers have a higher P/S ratio in absolute terms because the category is composed of tech stocks that have historically commanded higher valuations. This is why we've compared change over the past three years rather than absolute P/S ratios.) Power also has more unprofitable companies than any other category—so many in fact that we’re using price-to-sales as our benchmark valuation metric rather than the more common price-to-earnings ratio. Five of the 14 companies in our power basket are expected to report a loss this calendar year. No other category has more than one unprofitable company. The race to build the data centers that train and run AI models has set off an equally frenzied race to generate and transmit the vast amounts of electricity those data centers consume. Nuclear energy has attracted interest from tech companies for its efficiency and small carbon footprint. Microsoft, Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG), and Meta (META) have all signed multi-billion dollar deals with nuclear power plant operators like Constellation Energy Corp. (CEG) and Vistra (VST), both of which have seen their stocks surge over the past two years. But in their rush to bring reliable sources of electricity online, tech companies and investors have also thrown money at nuclear tech upstarts, some without operational generators or regulatory approvals. Shares of small modular reactor maker NuScale Power (SMR) doubled in value between January and mid-October. At the stock’s peak earlier this month, the company, which reported $37 million in revenue last year and isn’t expected to be profitable until 2029, was valued at more than $15 billion. Meanwhile, nuclear tech startup Oklo’s (OKLO) market capitalization peaked at $25.7 billion earlier this month, a 720% increase from the start of the year. Oklo is the only company of the 75 we’ve included in our analysis that is expected to report no revenue this year. Analysts forecast it will turn a profit for the first time in 2030. Though it’s not just nuclear businesses that have achieved rich valuations. Fermi (FRMI), the developer of a massive AI data center campus in the Texas Panhandle, was founded in January and went public in early October at a valuation of more than $19 billion. Fermi plans to build 11 gigawatts of computing capacity powered by on-site nuclear, natural gas, wind, and solar generators. It expects to break ground on its first data center in March, and hopes to have about 1 GW of capacity online by the end of 2026. AI power stocks just finished a volatile week that may underscore the extent to which their prices are driven by fickle sentiment. Constellation Energy and Vistra both shed more than 10% of their value in the first half of the week, as did GE Vernova (GEV), whose turbines are in high demand from data center clients seeking to draw on the South’s ample supply of natural gas. All three finished the week little changed. The upstarts were hit even harder. NuScale, Oklo, and Fermi all lost more than 25% of their value between Monday's open and midday Wednesday. But they too rebounded, finishing the week with losses in the low- to mid-teens.

Title: Tesla Posts Return to Revenue Growth, Though Q3 Profits Miss Estimates

Tesla returned to revenue growth in the third quarter as buyers rushed to take advantage of expiring tax credits. The electric vehicle maker's revenue climbed 12% year-over-year to $28.1 billion, topping analysts' expectations, in the wake of President Donald Trump's signature "One Big Beautiful Bill." Tesla (TSLA) said its vehicle deliveries reached a record high globally, showing "growth across all regions." That followed two straight quarters of decline as a backlash against CEO Elon Musk's political activities weighed on sales. A strong run of EV deliveries, many in response to the expiration of U.S. tax credits, helped power better-than-expected revenue at Tesla in the latest quarter. Enthusiasm about next-generation businesses like robots and robotaxis have pulled the stock into the black for 2025, but wariness about the car business may partly explain why it's among the lower-performing Magnificent 7 stocks this year. However, Tesla's adjusted earnings per share of $0.50 missed the consensus estimate of $0.54 compiled by Visible Alpha. The company said it faced higher costs from restructuring and investments in AI. The company in a shareholder letter said its Cybercab, semi truck and Megapack 3 battery products were "on schedule" for production at volume next year, adding that it was also installing production lines for its Optimus robots. Shares of Tesla, the first Magnificent 7 company to report third-quarter results, were down more than 1% in extended trading following the late-Wednesday release. They were up roughly 9% for 2025 through today's close, after spending much of the year in negative territory. Tesla has underperformed every Magnificent 7 stock so far this year except Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN), the latter which is the only one in the red for 2025. It's also lagged the Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS) along with the S&P 500, Dow, and Nasdaq. This article has been updated since it was first published to reflect share price movement and add new information and context.

Don’t waste another minute; learn more here.(Sponsor) Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) reportedly plans to spend billions to automate its warehouses. Thousands of employees will soon find themselves out of work. The New York Times got ahold of confidential Amazon documents that indicate the company plans to automate huge numbers of tasks that are done by people. Robots will take over their workload. Management also told its board that it expects a surge in orders, reaching twice the current level by 2033. “Robots” is another word for AI-based automation that can replace most of the people who work in its massive warehouses. These are central to Amazon’s ability to deliver items to customers in one or two days. By most estimates, Amazon has 350 warehouses worldwide and another 1,200 logistics facilities. The Times quoted Daron Acemoglu, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has a Nobel Prize in economics. He said, “Nobody else has the same incentive as Amazon to find a way to automate.” To accomplish this, the company’s e-commerce division will need nearly a million robots. Presumably, the plan will save hundreds of millions of dollars a year. Amazon indeed has a powerful incentive to set up a more automated system. Its North American e-commerce margins are thin. In the most recent quarter, revenue for the region was $100 billion and operating income was $7.5 billion. Amazon is uniquely positioned for the plan. It is among the early leaders in artificial intelligence. Up against Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft, and OpenAI, it plans to invest $100 billion in the technology this year. That is a staggering amount, even for the second-largest company in the United States as measured by revenue. It can recoup at least some of that AI investment by significantly cutting its e-commerce workforce.
