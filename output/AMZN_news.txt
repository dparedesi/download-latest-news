We recently published a list of 12 AI News and Ratings Investors Are Watching Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against other AI news and ratings investors are watching right now. At CNBC’s ‘Money Movers’, Jack Hidary, CEO of Sandbox AQ, emphasized the shift towards B2B-focused AI, positioning it as the next major evolution in artificial intelligence. While language models like those from OpenAI have excelled in consumer applications, Hidary highlighted the untapped potential of quantitative AI (QAI) in driving innovation across industries like pharmaceuticals, automotive, and energy. QAI uses fundamental equations to generate new data, which enables advancements in drug development, materials for energy storage, and aerospace. Hidary pointed out that large quantitative models are set to transform product development by creating significant economic value, unlike large language models, which primarily reduce operational costs. He predicts that 2025 and beyond will see a growing focus on AI’s role in addressing critical challenges in B2B sectors, from building better batteries to accelerating medical breakthroughs. This evolution underscores a future where AI goes beyond text-based applications, becoming a cornerstone for innovation across various industries.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia (NVDA) has had the kind of year most companies can only dream of. Its revenue and stock price soared thanks to prescient investments in artificial intelligence technologies that are paying off handsomely on the back of the generative AI wave. That’s not all. It’s repeatedly swapped places with Apple (AAPL) as the largest publicly traded company in the world by market cap, topping the $3 trillion mark. CEO Jensen Huang has become one of the most in-demand executives in Silicon Valley, meeting with everyone from fellow tech luminaries to world leaders and then some. And there’s more to come. The company is ramping up production of its high-powered Blackwell chip for AI applications and expects to ship several billion dollars worth of the hardware in the fourth quarter alone, with far more expected throughout the year ahead. “Nvidia really has the [hardware and software] for the AI computing era,” Futurum Group CEO Daniel Newman told Yahoo Finance. “It's all connected inside the [server] rack, outside the [server] rack, and then the software is very well … liked within the developer communities.” But the competition isn’t sitting idly by. Companies like AMD (AMD) are angling to poach Nvidia’s customers and slice into its estimated 80% to 90% market share. Even Nvidia’s own customers are working on chips meant to cut down on their reliance on the graphics giant’s semiconductors. And Wall Street is getting on board. Nvidia stock was down 1% before the bell on Thursday. Shares of Broadcom (AVGO), which works with companies like Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to design AI chips, are up 113% year to date and rocketed 44% in just the last month after CEO Hock Tan said AI could represent a $60 billion to $90 billion opportunity for the company in 2027 alone. Still, taking on Nvidia will be a tough task for any company. And dethroning it as the AI king, at least in 2025, will be all but impossible. Nvidia grabbed a first-mover advantage in the AI market on the back of early investments in AI software that unlocked its graphics chips to be used as high-powered processors. And it’s managed to hold onto that lead in the space thanks to continued advances in its hardware, as well as its Cuda software that allows developers to build apps for its chips. Because of that, so-called hyperscalers, massive cloud computing providers including Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet’s Google, Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and others continue to plow cash into buying up as many Nvidia chips as possible. In its most recent quarter, Nvidia reported total revenue of $35.1 billion. Of that, $30.8 billion, or 87% came from its data center business. “Everybody wants to build and train these huge models, and the most efficient way to do it is with CUDA software and Nvidia hardware,” TECHnalysis Research president and chief analyst Bob O’Donnell told Yahoo Finance. Nvidia is expected to continue to power the bulk of the AI industry in 2025 as well. The company’s Blackwell chip, the successor to its popular Hopper line of processors needed to power AI applications, is in production — and its customers, like Amazon, are already adding new cooling capabilities to their data centers to handle the immense heat the processors generate. “I don't know what the current backlog [for Nvidia’s chips is], but if it's not a year, it's close to a year,” O’Donnell said. “So, they're pretty much sold out for most of everything they're probably going to make next year already.” With hyperscalers calling for increased or at least the same level of capital expenditures in 2025 as in 2024, you can expect a chunk of that will end up going to the purchase of Blackwell chips. While Nvidia will retain control of the AI crown, there’s no shortage of challengers looking to take its throne. AMD and Intel (INTC) are the top contenders among chipmakers, and both have products on the market. AMD’s MI300X line of chips is designed to tackle Nvidia’s H100 Hopper chips, while Intel has its Gaudi 3 processor. AMD is better positioned to steal market share from Nvidia, though, as Intel continues to struggle amid its turnaround efforts and hunt for a new CEO. But even AMD is having a difficult time cracking Nvidia’s lead. “What AMD needs to do is make software really usable, build the systems where there's more demand …with developers, and ultimately, that could create more sell through,” Newman said. “Because these cloud providers are going to sell what their customers ask for.” It’s not just AMD and Intel, though. Nvidia’s customers are increasingly developing and pushing their own AI chips. Google has its Broadcom-based tensor processing unit chips (TPUs), while Amazon (AMZN) has its Trainium 2 processor and Microsoft (MSFT) has its Maia 100 accelerator. There’s also concern that the shift to "inferencing AI models" will reduce the need for high-powered Nvidia chips. Tech companies develop AI models by training them on huge amounts of data, otherwise referred to as the training process. Training requires incredibly powerful chips and lots of energy. Inferencing, or actually putting those AI models to work, is less resource- and power-intensive. As inferencing becomes a larger part of AI workloads, the thinking goes, companies will back away from needing to purchase so many Nvidia chips. Huang has said he is prepared for this, explaining at various events that Nvidia’s chips are just as good at inferencing as they are at training. Even if Nvidia’s market share slides, it doesn’t necessarily mean its business will be doing any worse than before. “This is definitely a case of raising all boats,” Newman said. “So even with much stronger competition, which I think they certainly will have, that doesn't mean they're going to fail. This is people building a bigger pie.” Email Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com. Follow him on Twitter at @DanielHowley.

Title: Retire On $460,000 In 2025 With This Simple 7-Fund Portfolio
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettowens/2024/12/22/retire-on-460k-in-2025-with-this-simple-7-fund-portfolio/
Time Published: 2024-12-22T15:00:00Z
Full Content:
Happy senior couple relaxing on deck chairs at beach The suits on Wall Street will say that $460K isn’t enough to retire on. Well, that “modest” nest egg will earn $64,860 in dividends alone when invested in this simple 7-CEF portfolio. CEFs are the code name for closed-end funds. They are a lesser-known cousin to exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds. CEFs tend to have modest assets under management. Which is their superpower. Fewer assets mean greater yields! Consider the 7-CEF portfolio we are about to discuss versus the standard high-yield stock benchmark ETF: CEF High Yields There is no comparison! But before we buy blindly, let’s do our homework and make sure these CEFs are not paper payout tigers. After all, a double-digit yield isn’t much good if it is soon chopped to single digits. Liberty All-Star Equity Fund (USA, 10.2% distribution rate) is as much of a straight shooter as we could want. This equity CEF, launched in 1987, provides a 60/40 blend of value/growth through roughly 145 stock picks selected by five teams of managers—three value-oriented and two growth-oriented. The top of the portfolio will look S&P 500-esque; names such as Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Amazon (AMZN) get top billing, ensuring we’re still getting exposure to tech megatrends like artificial intelligence. But other firms—such as Fresenius Medical Care (FMS), S&P Global (SPGI), and Capital One (COF)—enjoy much more weight than they do in the index. Despite a value lean, USA is surprisingly competitive. Importantly, USA isn’t leaning on leverage or options to generate that 10%-plus yield—that’s a combination of income, capital gains, and occasionally, return of capital. USA’s distribution policy is to pay out four quarterly installments of 2.5% of the fund’s net asset value, so payouts will float around a little bit. This does mean that from a pure price-performance perspective, Liberty All-Star doesn’t look nearly as good—but distributions cover that gap. A small 1.5% discount to NAV doesn’t seem like much compared to other closed-end funds, but that’s common for USA. In fact, its five-year average discount is a mere 0.5%. I won’t spend much time on Nuveen Floating Rate Income Fund (JFR, 11.4% distribution rate), which I highlighted in a recent review of double-digit bond ideas, but its massive monthly yield warrants a mention here. Nuveen Floating Rate Income Fund is a well-diversified portfolio of 430 corporate floating-rate bonds that leans heavily into junk (90% of assets are invested in below-investment-grade debt). Unlike USA, it puts the pedal to the debt metal, using a high 38% leverage to boost its picks—and that has worked in its favor with a wild 25% return over the past year. Just beware: This Nuveen CEF’s discount has all but evaporated. Western Asset Diversified Income (WDI, 12.1% distribution rate), a Franklin Templeton CEF, holds a wide array of debt investments. Commercial junk is the anchor of this fund, at about 40% of the portfolio, but WDI also provides exposure to collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), bank loans, commercial mortgage-backed securities (MBSs), investment-grade credit, emerging-market sovereigns, asset-backed securities (ABSs) and more. And this CEF also boasts access to private debt “not typically available through traditional mutual funds.” Credit quality is low, and leverage is high, resulting in a spectacular 12%-plus annual rate on its monthly distribution—and an interesting history for this relatively young fund (inception June 2021). There’s not much history here, valuation-wise, but its current 4% discount is slimmer than its three-year average (9%). Also note that WDI is a term trust that will liquidate on or about June 24, 2033. Another term-limited CEF with a wild yield is the BlackRock Innovation and Growth Term Trust (BIGZ, 13.4% distribution rate). This fund buys predominantly mid- and small-cap companies that are, well, “innovative” and that management believes have better-than-average earnings growth potential. Holdings include the likes of Taser maker Axon Enterprise (AXON) and tech electrical infrastructure firm Vertiv (VRT), but also private investments (which it folds under cryptic names like “Project Picasso”). Obviously, these innovative companies aren’t paying out dividends. Instead, BIGZ generates income by selling covered calls within the portfolio. Distributions have historically been entirely return of capital. And these big distributions are effectively mandated—BIGZ has a managed distribution plan that requires it to pay out 12% of its 12-month average NAV through at least September 2025. BIGZ is also subject to a discount management program. If this CEF trades at a discount greater than 7.5% during any of four three-month measurement periods, the fund will offer a repurchase of 2.5% of its outstanding common shares at a valuation of 98% of NAV. This program will run through March 31, 2025, and could be extended by the fund’s board. From publicly available info, it looks like BIGZ could hit that mark for the Oct. 1-Dec. 31 measurement period, and it currently trades at a nearly 11% discount to NAV. Just remember: “Discount” does not mean “value.” BIGZ’s strategy has been a disaster so far. While the fund is at least on an upswing now, it’s still undershooting a basic tech index. We can get our dividends from around the globe, too. And few international funds offer a yield as scintillating as The India Fund (IFN, 13.7% distribution rate). No options, and no leverage here. IFN is a straightforward Abrdn equity fund with a singular focus on the world’s second-largest country. It’s a tight portfolio, with just 45 components. Financials, such as ICICI Bank (IBN) and HDFC Bank (HDB), have long been prominent and currently make up a quarter of the portfolio. They’re followed by roughly 10% allocations in industrials and information technology. Again, distributions here are rarely made of dividend income—here, they’re almost always capital gains. But investors should have no complaints. One last note on IFN: It’s trading at a roughly 11% discount to NAV. While this is in line with its historical norms, it’s a welcome departure from the past couple of years, which saw IFN trade at slimmer discounts and even premiums at times. Abrdn Income Credit Strategies Fund (ACP, 15.7% distribution rate) is a global corporate junk fund. Roughly 30% of assets are invested in U.S. high-yield, with the remaining 70% scattered across the U.K., Luxembourg, Germany and more. Maturities are in line with comparable index funds—85% in 0-5 years, and most of the rest in 5-10 years. Credit quality is junkier, though, with 60% of assets in B-rated bonds and 23% in CCC-rated debt. (It shows, too—the monthly dole has dropped twice since 2020.) Leverage is moderate at close to 15%, but this is still an aggressive fund that rides like a roller coaster. That leads to mixed productivity, but ACP can be useful over shorter time periods. Currently, this CEF might be nearing one of those useful inflection points, as its discount to NAV has widened to about 9%—well above its five-year average discount of just 1%. Investors seeking out a more complete portfolio will find that in the BlackRock Capital Allocation Term Trust (BCAT, 22.1% distribution rate), another term trust that will dissolve on or about Sept. 27, 2032. They’ll also find one of the highest yields on Wall Street—a fat 20%-plus distribution that has already improved twice since the fund launched in 2020. BCAT is an allocation fund that provides a roughly 55/45 split of stocks and bonds. It uses little leverage (5%), but it does sell covered calls—generating a boatload of income, though the end result is that the lion’s share of distributions end up being return of capital. This CEF struggled mightily in its first two-plus years of trading, but it has fared much better during the second post-COVID bull market. The turnaround is a welcome one for shareholders, though most might be second-guessing just how much stability this balanced portfolio can really provide. BCAT belongs to the same discount management plan as BIGZ, and has a managed distribution plan that requires it to pay out 20% of its 12-month average NAV through at least September 2025. How long BCAT will continue to enjoy these support programs is unknown. And would-be investors get to wonder what’s next from this Jekyll-and-Hyde fund, whose meteoric run has also narrowed the discount from nearly 20% in 2023 to just 6% today.

Title: Spotify stock is trading at all-time highs just 2 years after a record low. Here's how it got there.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. At the end of 2022, Spotify (SPOT) stock was trading below $80 a share after a disastrous year for investors that erased over $35 billion from the company's market cap. Today, shares are trading at just under $500. The audio giant is on track to hit full-year profitability for the first time ever. And its market cap? About $100 billion, up from just $15 billion two years ago. The company's colossal run-up in stock price follows an intense business overhaul that's included everything from mass layoffs and C-suite shakeups to a major strategic shift away from podcasts, an area it had aggressively pursued. At the company's 2022 Investor Day, Spotify set seemingly lofty objectives that included long-term gross margin targets between 30% and 35%. At the time, the company had been struggling to turn a profit, with its gross margin stuck at around 25%. In the most recent quarter, Spotify said its gross margin increased to 31.1% from the prior year's 26.4%. "We've never been in a stronger position, thanks to what's really been an outstanding execution by the Spotify team," CEO Daniel Ek said during the company's fiscal third quarter earnings call in November. He added, "We are where we set out to be, if not a little bit further, and on a steady path toward achieving our long-term goals." Wall Street analysts who cover Spotify have a median price target of just around $486 a share with 29 Buy ratings, eight Holds, and just three Sells, according to the latest Bloomberg consensus estimates. Spotify, one of the stock market's big pandemic-era trades, saw shares balloon in early 2021 as the company sought to broaden its business from music streaming to other areas of the audio market. At the time, the company's endeavors echoed moves from other tech giants in pursuit of that goal. Think heavy spending on hiring and deep-pocketed investments in growth initiatives. For Spotify, that was podcasts. Between 2019 and 2021, Spotify spent $1 billion pushing into the podcast market, signing on celebrities like the Obamas, Prince Harry, and Kim Kardashian. The company paid $230 million to acquire podcast studio Gimlet in 2019. Spotify then paid a reported $200 million to bring Joe Rogan exclusively to the platform, and another $200 million for the Ringer in 2020. But the spending era was short-lived as investors and analysts began to focus on the company's lack of profitability and cash flow issues, questioning the staying power of the business model and the credibility of CEO Daniel Ek. It's hard to make money in the audio streaming business, largely due to the sky-high price of content. And compared to its main competitors — deep-pocketed tech behemoths like Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet's YouTube (GOOG, GOOGL), and Apple (AAPL) — Spotify has had an even tougher time absorbing those costs. At the same time, companies in the space have to invest to expand their offerings to win market share. At Spotify, not only was spending aggressive, but a soft advertising market further crimped profit margins. Management attempted to assuage fears with promises that 2022 was a peak investment year and that profitability metrics would begin to improve in 2023. Skepticism still rang high. "Heading into 2023, investors looked at their targets and thought they were very overly ambitious," Morgan Stanley analyst Ben Swinburne told Yahoo Finance in an interview. "It really wasn't until they started to see the company make some proactive moves to drive both top-line growth, but also improve the profits of the company, that investors started to come back to the stock." Turnaround efforts first began in early 2023 as the company reorganized and consolidated business units. It adjusted its podcast strategy to focus more on reaching bigger audiences as opposed to maintaining exclusive content. It also changed up its royalty structure to combat streaming fraud and curb the massive volume of music on the platform, which has escalated as a result of generative AI. But the changes picked up steam over the course of last year, culminating in the fourth quarter when "two really important things happened as it relates to the stock performance," Swinburne said. No. 1, in Swinburne's view, was price increases. Spotify implemented a broad set of price hikes across roughly 70% of its footprint by revenue in mid-2023. The hikes were "much larger and broader than they'd ever done before as a company," the analyst said. Second: massive cost-cutting. The company laid off 17% of its workforce, or about 1,500 employees, in December 2023. This followed a combined 800 employees who were laid off earlier in the year as a result of several restructurings. At the time, the significant reduction in headcount was estimated to lead to approximately 300 million euros ($315 million) in annualized cost savings for fiscal year 2024. "I don't know if I've ever seen a company take that aggressive of cost action while their revenue growth was accelerating, but it was happening at the same time the price increases were being put into place," Swinburne said. "So you had this dual effect of faster revenue growth combined with reduced expenses, which really set the company up into 2024 with a rapidly improving profit profile." Soon after the December layoffs, Spotify also announced that its CFO Paul Vogel would step down from his position after eight years. Vogel, who joined Spotify in 2016 as head of investor relations before taking over the CFO role in 2020, exited his position on March 31. Christian Luiga has since stepped into the role. The efforts didn't stop there. This year, Spotify has doubled down on another growth area with massive potential: audiobooks. "The audiobooks launch is much bigger than audiobooks," Swinburne explained. "It's really about transitioning Spotify from a music-only service to a bundle." The company introduced a higher-priced audio "bundle" that includes music, podcasts, and audiobooks. It also rolled out an audiobooks-only plan and a music-only streaming tier in an effort to cater to a variety of consumers. The changes allowed the company to increase prices for the second time in less than a year. "Spotify was able to show the value of the product to consumers because it had no noticeable churn increase from all of the pricing changes," Swinburne said. "And then, because they transitioned to a bundle, the margins of the business got meaningfully better." To that point, the long-term gross margin goal of 30% to 35% Ek set out for has already been achieved, with the metric once again expected to climb in the fourth quarter to 31.8%. "I think this demonstrates what we've been saying over the past year," Ek said last month. "Spotify is not just a great product but well on its way to become a great business." The proof is in the numbers: Spotify has continued to attract (and not lose) users despite higher prices. Its engagement remains the strongest among competitors, and the value-add of new bundles and premium offerings only strengthens its position. But perhaps most importantly, it's finally making money. And that's always music to investors' ears. Alexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance. Follow her on X @allie_canal, LinkedIn, and email her at alexandra.canal@yahoofinance.com.
