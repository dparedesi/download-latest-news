AWS Blogs When you’re working with large datasets, you’ve likely encountered the challenge of processing complex JSON structures in your automated workflows. You need to preprocess arrays within nested JSON objects before you can run parallel processing on them. Extracting data used to require custom code and extra processing steps, delaying you from building your core application logic. With AWS Step Functions Distributed Map, you can process large datasets with concurrent iterations of workflow steps across data entries. Using the enhanced ItemsPointer feature of Distributed Maps, you can extract array data directly from JSON objects stored in Amazon S3. Alternatively, for JSON object as state input, you can use Items (JSONata) or ItemsPath (JSONPath). With this enhancement you can point directly to arrays nested within JSON structures, eliminating the need for custom preprocessing of your data. With ItemsPointer, Items, and ItemsPath you can select the nested array data and simplify your workflows. In this post, we explore how to optimize processing array data embedded within complex JSON structures using AWS Step Functions Distributed Map. You’ll learn how to use ItemsPointer to reduce the complexity of your state machine definitions, create more flexible workflow designs, and streamline your data processing pipelines—all without writing additional transformation code or AWS Lambda functions. In this e-commerce use case example, you’ll build a sample application that demonstrates processing of product inventory data for an e-commerce application using AWS Step Functions Distributed Map. The application receives a JSON file from an upstream application containing an array of product information. The Step Functions workflow reads the JSON file containing product data from an S3 bucket and iterates over the array to enrich each product data in the array. The following diagram presents the AWS Step Functions state machine. JSON array processing workflow The JSON array is processed using the following workflow: MaxConcurrency can be configured to specify the number of child workflow executions in a Distributed Map that can run in parallel. If not specified, then Step Functions doesn’t limit concurrency and runs 10,000 parallel child workflow executions. You can read a JSON file from a S3 bucket using ItemReader and its sub-fields. If the JSON file, from the S3 bucket, contains a nested object structure, you can select the specific node with your data set with an ItemsPointer. For example, the following input JSON file: The following JSONata-based workflow configuration extracts a nested list of products from productUpdates/items: For JSONPath-based workflow note that Arguments is replaced with Parameters: The ItemReader field is not needed when your dataset is JSON data from a previous step. ItemsPointer is only applicable when the input JSON objects read from an S3 bucket. If you are using JSON as state input to a Distributed Map, then you can use the ItemsPath (for JSONPath) or Items (for JSONata) field to specify a location in the input that points to JSON array or object used for iterations. To use Step Functions Distributed Map, verify you have: Run the following steps to deploy the Step Functions state machine. Enter the following details: The outputs from the sam deploy will be used in the subsequent steps. The state machine reads the input product-updates.json file and invokes a Lambda function to update the database for every product in the array after adding price and stock information. The execution metadata is also uploaded into the results bucket. Run the following steps to monitor and verify the test results. Wait until the status shows SUCCEEDED. To avoid costs, remove all resources you’ve created while following along with this post. Run the following command after replacing the <placeholder> variable to delete the resources you deployed for this post’s solution: In this post, you learned how to use Step Functions Distributed Map for extracting array data natively from JSON objects stored in a S3 bucket. By removing custom data extraction code, you can simplify the processing of your large-scale parallel workloads. With ItemsPointer you can extract array data within JSON files stored in a S3 bucket , and with Items(JSONata) or ItemsPath (JSONPath), you can extract arrays from complex JSON state input, adding flexibility to your workflow designs. New input sources for Distributed Map are available in all commercial AWS Regions where AWS Step Functions is available. For a complete list of AWS Regions where Step Functions is available, see the AWS Region Table. To get started, you can use the Distributed Map mode today in the AWS Step Functions console.

A linkup with an artificial intelligence player helped power shares of a top cloud-computing services company higher Monday, while an acquisition in the consumer goods space sent the two stocks on divergent paths. Major U.S. equities indexes ended the first trading day of November mixed, kicking off a market week that will bring a wave of big-name quarterly reports. The S&P 500 added 0.2%, while the Nasdaq was up 0.5%. The Dow ended the session 0.5% lower. For more from Investopedia on the day's major market news, click here. IDEXX Laboratories (IDXX) shares jumped 15%, the best performance on the S&P 500 today, after the pet health specialist reported better-than-expected third quarter sales and profit. The company raised its 2025 revenue and earnings per share guidance, highlighting global customer adoption of its new diagnostic tools, which IDEXX says can help veterinarian teams increase clinical insights and streamline their workflows. Paper products giant Kimberly-Clark (KMB) said it would buy Tylenol, Band-Aid, and Listerine parent company Kenvue (KVUE) in a cash-and-stock deal valued at around $49 billion. Kenvue, which completed a spin-off from Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) in 2023, has been navigating litigation over allegations that its talcum powder causes cancer and statements from the Trump administration linking Tylenol to autism. Kenvue shares rose more than 12% Monday following the announcement of the deal, which came at a significant premium to Friday's closing price for Kenvue stock, while Kimberly-Clark shares plunged more than 14%. The latter company's shares were the worst performers on the S&P 500 today. Amazon (AMZN) shares jumped 5% after ChatGPT owner OpenAI signed an agreement to buy more than $38 billion worth of capacity its Amazon Web Services cloud unit. OpenAI said the deal to use AWS infrastructure would provide it with access to a significant number of Nvidia (NVDA) graphics processing units that could be employed to train its AI models. Nvidia shares gained 2.2%. Moderna (MRNA) stock sank 8.3% Monday, reversing a portion of the gains posted last week amid reports that the vaccine maker had held strategic talks with a major pharmaceutical company about a potential partnership or sale. Waning enthusiasm around a possible deal and concerns about the company's financial situation overshadowed Moderna's announcement that it administered the first dose in an early stage study of its experimental multiple myeloma therapy. KeyBanc downgraded Charter Communications (CHTR) stock to "sector weight" from "overweight" after the cable and internet provider reported lower-than-expected third-quarter sales and profit in its most-recent quarterly release. Analysts cited competitive headwinds to Charter's broadband subscriber growth, which can affect its free cash flow. Its stock fell about 5%.
