The busiest shopping week of the year has arrived, bringing with it a frenzy of questions: What to buy? Where to buy? And how much to buy? Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday mark the start of the holiday shopping season, drawing millions of consumers to stores and online platforms in search of the best deals. And, of course, there’s excitement for the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade later this month. More than just a shopping extravaganza, this period serves as a critical barometer of the nation’s economic health. Retail sales during these days offer valuable insights into consumer confidence, spending habits, and the overall financial pulse of the country. This year, holiday sales are projected to reach nearly $1 trillion, a 3.5% increase over the last year, according to the National Retail Federation. To help you navigate the excitement, here’s a curated list of retailers offering deals this holiday season, whether you’re shopping for tech, fashion, or home essentials. Walmart (WMT+2.34%) shoppers have a chance to score deals on both practical items and more extravagant gifts. While Black Friday discounts are available to all customers, Walmart’s loyalty members get exclusive perks, including early access to online deals. Additionally, Walmart is introducing “deal drops” and an AI shopping assistant to assist customers. On Amazon (AMZN-0.65%), Black Friday deals are available to all customers. Prime members often get extra perks, like early access to select deals – sometimes up to 30 minutes ahead of the general public. Target (TGT+2.78%) announced price cuts on 2,000 items in October, adding to the 5,000 products it marked down in May. Target shoppers have the opportunity to snag deals on everyday essentials and higher-end items. While Black Friday discounts will be available to all shoppers, Target’s loyalty members receive additional benefits, including early access to online deals and unlimited same-day delivery. If you want to buy fancy bags from Coach, Saks Fifth Avenue, Neiman Marcus, and others, check the list here for what they have to offer. This week, investors will see a lighter schedule for earnings reports, with no announcements expected on Thursday or Friday due to the Thanksgiving holiday. The stock market will be closed on Thursday, Thanksgiving day. However, the first half of the week remains eventful. On Monday, Bath & Body Works (BBWI+0.65%) is set to release its earnings results before the market closes. Tuesday will feature a flurry of activity from major retailers. Macy’s (M+8.16%), Burlington Stores (BURL+4.91%), Best Buy (BBY+3.54%), and Kohl’s (KKS) will announce their earnings before the market opens, providing insights into consumer spending trends as the holiday shopping season kicks off. Later in the day, tech giants Dell Technologies (DELL+3.83%) and HP (HPQ+0.58%) will report their earnings after the market closes. Also on Tuesday, cybersecurity leader CrowdStrike (CRWD+4.08%) will release its quarterly results post-market. This update will be closely watched, especially after the company faced a global outage earlier this year, raising questions about its resilience and operational performance. With key sectors including retail, technology, and cybersecurity in focus, these earnings could offer valuable indicators for broader market trends ahead of the holiday break. This week’s shortened schedule due to the Thanksgiving holiday means a lighter-than-usual release of macroeconomic data. However, several significant reports are still on the docket, providing valuable insights into the economy. On Tuesday, the Consumer Confidence Index for November will be released, offering a glimpse into consumer sentiment amid ongoing economic uncertainties. Additionally, new home sales data for October will be published, shedding light on activity in the housing market. In the afternoon, the FOMC minutes meeting will be made available, potentially offering clues about the central bank’s monetary policy outlook and inflation strategy. The economic focus continues on Wednesday, starting with the release of initial jobless claims, a weekly barometer of labor market health. Also on Wednesday, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index, a key measure of inflation tracking changes in consumer spending on goods and services, will be published. This data is closely watched by the Federal Reserve in shaping interest rate decisions. Additionally, the GDP’s first revision for Q3 will be released, providing an updated view of the economy’s performance during the third quarter. — Francisco Velasquez and Madeline Fitzgerald contributed to this article.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks whipsawed Thursday as investors digested Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings and a more than 6% tumble from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) amid a Department of Justice move to break up its empire. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained more than 500 points, or 1.2% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) pared earlier losses to hover near the flatline. Investors gravitated towards Industrials (XLI) and Financials (XLF) while selling off Big Tech. Nvidia beat on profit in the third quarter, but the chipmaker forecast its slowest revenue growth in seven quarters as it noted supply chain issues. Those constraints will limit deliveries of the new flagship Blackwell chip, the company said — but will also lead to demand outstripping supply into 2026. That suggests a revenue boost is just being pushed down the road until the issues ease, some analysts suggested, given the dearth of sizable competitors in AI chipmaking. Shares seesawed early Thursday, with Nvidia initially opening at an intraday record before erasing those gains. At last check, the stock was down about 1%. Elsewhere in tech, Alphabet's slide came after the DOJ asked a judge to force Google to sell off its Chrome browser. On the macroeconomic front, weekly jobless claims released on Thursday morning came in at 213,000, a decline from the prior week. Investors are weighing the Federal Reserve's appetite for interest rate cuts. Traders are now pricing in a 44% chance of the Fed holding pat at its December meeting, up from about 28% a week ago, per the CME FedWatch tool. Investors are also on alert for Donald Trump to end the drawn-out wait for his Treasury secretary pick as they assess the likely impact of the president-elect's Cabinet choices on prospects for the economy. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) briefly climbed to a fresh all-time high just above $98,000. The biggest cryptocurrency is closing in on the key $100,000 milestone amid reports that Trump's team is debating whether to appoint a White House crypto policy chief. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy Oil jumped more than 1% on Thursday as the Russia-Ukraine war escalated, outweighing an uptick in inventories. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) futures hovered just below $70 per barrel, while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark, traded just above $74 per barrel. Crude moved higher after Kyiv said Moscow launched what appeared to be a long-range intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) into Ukraine, in what would be the first use in war of a weapon primarily used for nuclear delivery. Western officials later told Reuters their initial analysis showed it was not an ICBM, but they left open the possibility their conclusion could change. Read more here. Former Florida congressman Matt Gaetz has withdrawn his name from consideration for US attorney general. "While the momentum was strong, it is clear that my confirmation was unfairly becoming a distraction to the critical work of the Trump/Vance Transition. There is no time to waste on a needlessly protracted Washington scuffle, thus I'll be withdrawing my name from consideration to serve as Attorney General," wrote Gaetz on X on Thursday. Last week President-elect Donald Trump picked Gaetz to serve as attorney general. The pick was controversial since Gaetz was recently at the center of a House Ethics investigation. The report on that probe has not been released. Yahoo Finance's Claire Boston reports: Mortgage rates ticked up last week, providing little relief to prospective homebuyers in a seasonally slower time for the housing market. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate was 6.84% in the week through Wednesday, according to Freddie Mac data, compared with 6.78% a week earlier. The average 15-year rate rose to 6.02%, from 5.99% a week earlier. Rates have been marching back toward 7% as 10-year Treasury yields, which closely track mortgage rates, have remained around 4.4% in the weeks since the election. Read more here. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) was trading in green territory by 11:45 a.m. ET on Thursday as stocks pared losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.8% while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was down 0.5% as shares of Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) dragged on the tech-heavy index. The tech giant sank more than 6% as as investors assessed the Department of Justice's push for Google to sell its Chrome browser. Meanwhile Nvidia (NVDA) shares also sagged more than 1% after gaining as much as 4% in early trading. Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports: MicroStrategy (MSTR) stock was on another wild ride early Thursday, rising as much as 11% before forfeiting a chunk of those gains after short seller Citron Research said it had taken a new bet against the stock, which has gained over 600% this year. MicroStrategy stock has soared more than 80% since crypto-friendly President-elect Donald Trump’s victory earlier in November. Bitcoin itself is up roughly 30% over the same period, hitting a fresh record of $98,000 early Thursday before paring gains after the market open. In a post on X early Thursday, Citron Research said that while the firm remains bullish on bitcoin — and was bullish on MicroStrategy's bitcoin play years ago — the move in MicroStrategy stock has "completely detached from BTC fundamentals." Read more here. Losses on the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) accelerated to a session low on Thursday. The tech-heavy index dropped more than 1.2%, with Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) shares leading the declines. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) also fell 0.4%. Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) shares tumbled more than 5% on Thursday morning as investors assessed the Department of Justice's proposed Google changes which include the forced sale of Google's Chrome browser. Alphabet shares sank to a session low by 10:30 a.m. ET. The rest of the "Magnificent Seven" stocks lagged too, with AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) dropping more than 2%. Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META) also sank. Nvidia (NVDA) shares struggled for direction on Thursday morning, flipping between positive and negative territory. The stock pared gains after surging more than 4% in early trading. By 10:10 a.m. ET, shares were trading down more than 1.5%. Nvidia beat on profit in its latest quarter but projected slowing revenue growth. Wall Street analysts, however were bullish on the company's next-generation chip, called Blackwell, with Wedbush's Dan Ives stating the company's results were "flawless." "We would characterize results as another earnings press release from Nvidia that should be framed and hung in the Louvre given these eye popping results and unprecedented growth from the Godfather of AI Jensen and Nvidia," wrote Ives. Existing home sales rose in October as house hunters returned to the market. Sales of previously owned homes increased 2.9% from a year ago to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.96 million, marking the first annual gain since July 2021, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. Sales climbed 3.4% from September. Economists polled by Bloomberg expected existing home sales to reach a pace of 3.95 million in October. “The worst of the downturn in home sales could be over, with increasing inventory leading to more transactions,” NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun wrote in a press statement. Homes typically go under contract a month or two before the contract closes, which means the October data largely reflects decisions made in September and August. Rates on the 30-year mortgages fell to around 6% in September. Cheaper borrowing costs typically spur more housing activity. But rates are now hovering around 6.7%, according to Freddie Mac. “Additional job gains and continued economic growth appear assured, resulting in growing housing demand. However, for most first-time homebuyers, mortgage financing is critically important," Yun said. "While mortgage rates remain elevated, they are expected to stabilize.” The data also showed that the median home price rose 4% from last October to $407,200, marking the 16th consecutive month of annual price increases. US stocks climbed on Thursday as investors digested Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings while bitcoin (BTC-USD) briefly hit yet another record high just north of $98,000. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.3%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) added 0.%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on 0.6%, coming off a muted day for the major gauges. Nvidia beat on profit in the third quarter, but the chipmaker's revenue growth forecast slowed. Shares of the AI chip heavyweight erased premarket losses to open 4% higher. Meanwhile, bitcoin soared more than 5% earlier on Thursday, climbing closer to the $100,000 threshold amid optimism that the incoming Trump administration will implement crypto-friendly policies. Weekly jobless claims rose less than expected last week in a sign of cooling in the labor market. New data from the Department of Labor showed 213,000 initial jobless claims were filed in the week ending Nov. 16, down from 219,000 the week prior and below the 220,000 economists had expected. The weekly claims for unemployment have been falling steadily throughout the past several weeks after hitting their highest level in more than a year in October. Meanwhile, the number of continuing applications for unemployment benefits hit 1.9 million, up 36,000 from the week prior and the highest level since November 2021. Economic data: Initial jobless claims (week ending Nov. 16); Leading index (October); Existing home sales (October); Kansas City Fed manufacturing activity (November) Earnings: Baidu (BIDU), BJ's (BJ), Deere & Company (DE), Gap (GAP), Intuit (INTU), Ross Stores (ROST), Warner Music Group (WMG) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed overnight and early this morning: Nvidia slips after earnings beat amid 'full steam' demand Bitcoin closes in on $100,000 amid Trump crypto hopes Goldman leads bullish Nvidia price target overhauls post-earnings DOJ wants a Google breakup. But it still has a way to go. Fed's Barkin says US more at risk of inflation shocks: FT Biden administration seeks to cancel $4.6B of Ukraine's debt Starbucks weighs strategic partnerships for China operations Bitcoin (BTC-USD) jumped more than 5% to a record high Thursday morning, trading just north of $98,000 amid speculation of pro-crypto policies from an incoming Trump administration. The token has soared roughly 40% since the presidential elections earlier this month, hitting multiple milestones as investors eye the target of $100,000. Reports that President-elect Donald Trump's transition team has discussed the possibility of a first-ever crypto policy chief for the White House has helped lift the token in the past 24 hours. Bitcoin has been a key component of the Trump trade, as the incoming president has promised to explore crypto-friendly initiatives, including the creation of a national bitcoin stockpile. The Target (TGT) ticker page on Yahoo Finance is still seeing strong interest after the stock's 21.9% post-earnings drubbing on Wednesday. Shares are up slightly in the premarket. From top to bottom, Target's results flat-out stunk. The reality is the stock is likely to stay in the penalty box until Target can deliver at least two quarters of healthy earnings beats on the back of stronger sales. I think Deutsche Bank analyst Krisztina Katai did a good job summarizing the issues: "Results indicate a significant deterioration in market share, primarily to Walmart and Amazon. This, coupled with the necessary investments in infrastructure and supply chain modernization to remain competitive, suggests a longer time-line to recovery than initially projected. While we still believe Target's long-term potential remains, regaining lost market share will likely require substantial price investments and stepped up promos, pressuring margins and profitability." I list several of the challenges Target is up against below: Nvidia (NVDA) is under a little pressure in the premarket after earnings last night. It makes sense, as CEO Jensen Huang didn't blow everyone away with quarterly revenue guidance. But to be clear, the guidance was impressive — just not at the very high end of some very robust Street estimates. An important point, however, is making the rounds this morning on Nvidia's margins. If the sell-off accelerates in the session, it could be a function of some near-term margin concerns as Nvidia ramps up production of its latest AI chip, Blackwell. Usually, during ramp periods, costs are elevated and profit margins are not at peak levels. As Keybanc analyst John Vinh noted: "Nvidia noted it's supply constrained on Blackwell in the fiscal fourth quarter, and given the ramp of multiple platforms, expects gross margin to temporarily be in low 70s in fiscal first quarter 2026 before returning to mid-70s in the second half."

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the way higher, gaining over 450 points, or about 1.1%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.5%, and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) pared earlier losses to finish just above the flat line.

The biggest cryptocurrency is closing in on the key $100,000 milestone after Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gar Gensler announced he'd be stepping down in January 2025. Crypto enthusiasts are hopeful a more pro-crypto chair will take Gensler's place. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy While the major market indexes rose on Thursday, megacap tech struggled as investors digested fresh earnings from Nvidia (NVDA) and a tumble from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) amid a Department of Justice move to break up its empire. Our look at the Nasdaq 100 (^NDX) below shows the downbeat sentiment was largely kept to the largest tech names and didn't proliferate throughout the index. This was also seen in the broader Information Technology (XLK) sector, which rose 1% on the day. MicroStrategy stock (MSTR) tanked more than 17% in late trading on Thursday. The stock had been up in premarket trading as bitcoin, which MicroStrategy owns a large chunk of, hit record highs. But early in Thursday's session short seller Citron Research said it had taken a new bet against the stock, which has gained over 600% this year. Citron Research said that while the firm remains bullish on bitcoin — and was bullish on MicroStrategy's bitcoin play years ago — the move in MicroStrategy stock has "completely detached from BTC fundamentals."

New data released Thursday morning showed weekly jobless claims hit their lowest level since April, reversing any concerns from recent upticks seen in the data over the past several months. Data from the Department of Labor showed 213,000 initial jobless claims were filed in the week ending Nov. 16, down from 219,000 the week prior and below the 220,000 economists had expected. The weekly unemployment claims have been falling steadily throughout the past several weeks after hitting their highest level in more than a year in October. "After being boosted by the Boeing strike and Hurricanes Helene and Milton, claims have returned to a level consistent with limited layoffs," Oxford Economics lead US economist Nancy Vanden Houten wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. Weakness in the labor market had been a concern through the summer and into the fall as jobless claims picked up along with a rise in the unemployment rate and a decline in monthly job gains. This data contributed to the Fed's calculus when cutting interest rates by half a percentage point in September. But since then, labor market data has come in better than expected with the unemployment rate falling from a peak of 4.3% to 4.1%. And for now things appear to be OK on the labor side of the Federal Reserve's dual mandate. "The weekly claims report remains the best real-time monitor of labor market conditions," Jefferies US economist Thomas Simons wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. "Right now, the data show that the labor market is trending sideways at a healthy level." Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports: Crypto enthusiasts got the announcement they wanted Thursday when Gary Gensler said he would step down from the SEC in January, clearing the way for a more favorable relationship between the cryptocurrency industry and a key Washington regulator. A Gensler exit as chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission was high on the wish list of many crypto executives, and President-elect Donald Trump made the removal of the SEC boss a promise to the industry while on the campaign trail.

And analysts across the Street were quick to praise the results, which showed the world's largest public company continuing to benefit from the AI boom. Wedbush’s Dan Ives called the results "flawless" and said Nvidia's earnings release “should be framed and hung in the Louvre” in a note to investors Thursday. "We believe the path to $4 trillion market cap and beyond is now laid out by Nvidia and this is bullish for the broader tech rally into year-end and 2025," Ives wrote. While other analysts didn’t go so far as to draw parallels between Nvidia’s financials and fine art, analysts at investment firms including JPMorgan (JPM), DA Davidson, and Bernstein raised their price targets on the stock following Wednesday's report. Those analysts and others were encouraged by Nvidia's statements about its Blackwell products and dismissed anxieties over an AI spending slowdown. Read the full story here. Eight of the 11 sectors were outperforming the S&P 500 (^GSPC) on Thursday and in a widespread rally on Wall Street. Financials (XLF) led the sector action, rising more than 1.5%. Only the Consumer Discretionary (XLY) and Communications Services (XLC) sectors were underperforming the benchmark index. Below is a look at the day's sector action. Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler will step down on January 20, 2025, the SEC announced on Thursday. Gensler, who began his tenure in April 2021, didn't provide a specific reason in his statement for why he's stepping down. “The Securities and Exchange Commission is a remarkable agency,” Gensler said in a statement. “The staff and the Commission are deeply mission-driven, focused on protecting investors, facilitating capital formation, and ensuring that the markets work for investors and issuers alike. The staff comprises true public servants. It has been an honor of a lifetime to serve with them on behalf of everyday Americans and ensure that our capital markets remain the best in the world." Gensler's departure day aligns with Inauguration Day, when President-elect Donald Trump is expected to be sworn in as the next president of the US. In July, Trump attended a bitcoin conference in Nashville to court voters. Trump's promises to the industry include appointing a crypto Presidential Advisory Council, firing SEC Chair Gary Gensler, and creating a "strategic national bitcoin stockpile." Oil jumped more than 1% on Thursday as the Russia-Ukraine war escalated, outweighing an uptick in inventories. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) futures hovered just below $70 per barrel, while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark, traded just above $74 per barrel.

US stocks whipsawed Thursday as investors digested Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings and a more than 6% tumble from Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) amid a Department of Justice move to break up its empire. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was up 0.9%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) pared earlier losses to slip 0.5%, as Nvidia and Alphabet led the "Magnificent Seven" stocks lower. Nvidia beat on profit in the third quarter, but the chipmaker forecast its slowest revenue growth in seven quarters as it noted supply chain issues. Those constraints will limit deliveries of the new flagship Blackwell chip, the company said — but will also lead to demand outstripping supply into 2026. That suggests a revenue boost is just being pushed down the road until the issues ease, some analysts suggested, given the dearth of sizable competitors in AI chipmaking. Shares seesawed early Thursday, with Nvidia initially opening at an intraday record before erasing those gains. At last check, the stock was down nearly 1%. Elsewhere in tech, Alphabet's slide came after the DOJ asked a judge to force Google to sell off its Chrome browser. On the macroeconomic front, weekly jobless claims released on Thursday morning came in at 213,000, a decline from the prior week. Investors are weighing the Federal Reserve's appetite for interest rate cuts. Traders are now pricing in a 44% chance of the Fed holding pat at its December meeting, up from about 28% a week ago, per the CME FedWatch tool. Investors are also on alert for Donald Trump to end the drawn-out wait for his Treasury secretary pick as they assess the likely impact of the president-elect's Cabinet choices on prospects for the economy. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) briefly climbed to a fresh all-time high just above $98,000. The biggest cryptocurrency is closing in on the key $100,000 milestone amid reports that Trump's team is debating whether to appoint a White House crypto policy chief. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports: MicroStrategy (MSTR) stock was on another wild ride early Thursday, rising as much as 11% before forfeiting a chunk of those gains after short-seller Citron Research said it had taken a new bet against the stock, which has gained over 600% this year. MicroStrategy stock has soared more than 80% since crypto-friendly president-elect Donald Trump’s victory earlier in November. Bitcoin itself is up roughly 30% over the same period, hitting a fresh record of $98,000 early Thursday before paring gains after the market open. In a post on X early Thursday, Citron Research said that while the firm remains bullish on bitcoin — and was bullish on MicroStrategy's bitcoin play years ago — the move in MicroStrategy stock has "completely detached from BTC fundamentals." Read more here. Losses on the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) accelerated to a session low on Thursday. The tech-heavy index dropped more than 1.2%, with Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) shares leading the declines. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) also fell 0.4%. Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) shares tumbled more than 5% on Thursday morning as investors assessed the Department of Justice's proposed Google changes which include the forced sale of Google's Chrome browser. Alphabet shares sank to a session low by 10:30 a.m. ET. The rest of the "Magnificent Seven" stocks lagged too, with AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) dropping more than 2%. Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META) also sank. Nvidia (NVDA) shares struggled for direction on Thursday morning, flipping between positive and negative territory. The stock pared gains after surging more than 4% in early trading. By 10:10 a.m. ET, shares were trading down more than 1.5%. Nvidia beat on profit in its latest quarter but projected slowing revenue growth. Wall Street analysts, however were bullish on the company's next-generation chip, called Blackwell, with Wedbush's Dan Ives stating the company's results were "flawless." "We would characterize results as another earnings press release from Nvidia that should be framed and hung in the Louvre given these eye popping results and unprecedented growth from the Godfather of AI Jensen and Nvidia," wrote Ives. Existing home sales rose in October as house hunters returned to the market. Sales of previously owned homes increased 2.9% from a year ago to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.96 million, marking the first annual gain since July 2021, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. Sales climbed 3.4% from September. Economists polled by Bloomberg expected existing home sales to reach a pace of 3.95 million in October. “The worst of the downturn in home sales could be over, with increasing inventory leading to more transactions,” NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun wrote in a press statement. Homes typically go under contract a month or two before the contract closes, which means the October data largely reflects decisions made in September and August. Rates on the 30-year mortgages fell to around 6% in September. Cheaper borrowing costs typically spur more housing activity. But rates are now hovering around 6.7%, according to Freddie Mac. “Additional job gains and continued economic growth appear assured, resulting in growing housing demand. However, for most first-time homebuyers, mortgage financing is critically important," Yun said. "While mortgage rates remain elevated, they are expected to stabilize.” The data also showed that the median home price rose 4% from last October to $407,200, marking the 16th consecutive month of annual price increases. US stocks climbed on Thursday as investors digested Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings while bitcoin (BTC-USD) briefly hit yet another record high just north of $98,000. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.3%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) added 0.%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) put on 0.6%, coming off a muted day for the major gauges. Nvidia beat on profit in the third quarter, but the chipmaker's revenue growth forecast slowed. Shares of the AI chip heavyweight erased premarket losses to open 4% higher. Meanwhile, bitcoin soared more than 5% earlier on Thursday, climbing closer to the $100,000 threshold amid optimism that the incoming Trump administration will implement crypto-friendly policies. Weekly jobless claims rose less than expected last week in a sign of cooling in the labor market. New data from the Department of Labor showed 213,000 initial jobless claims were filed in the week ending Nov. 16, down from 219,000 the week prior and below the 220,000 economists had expected. The weekly claims for unemployment have been falling steadily throughout the past several weeks after hitting their highest level in more than a year in October. Meanwhile, the number of continuing applications for unemployment benefits hit 1.9 million, up 36,000 from the week prior and the highest level since November 2021.

Bitcoin has been a key component of the Trump trade, as the incoming president has promised to explore crypto-friendly initiatives, including the creation of a national bitcoin stockpile. The Target (TGT) ticker page on Yahoo Finance is still seeing strong interest after the stock's 21.9% post-earnings drubbing on Wednesday. Shares are up slightly in the premarket. From top to bottom, Target's results flat-out stunk. The reality is the stock is likely to stay in the penalty box until Target can deliver at least two quarters of healthy earnings beats on the back of stronger sales. I think Deutsche Bank analyst Krisztina Katai did a good job summarizing the issues: "Results indicate a significant deterioration in market share, primarily to Walmart and Amazon. This, coupled with the necessary investments in infrastructure and supply chain modernization to remain competitive, suggests a longer time-line to recovery than initially projected. While we still believe Target's long-term potential remains, regaining lost market share will likely require substantial price investments and stepped up promos, pressuring margins and profitability." I list several of the challenges Target is up against below: Nvidia (NVDA) is under a little pressure in the premarket after earnings last night. It makes sense, as CEO Jensen Huang didn't blow everyone away with quarterly revenue guidance. But to be clear, the guidance was impressive — just not at the very high end of some very robust Street estimates. An important point, however, is making the rounds this morning on Nvidia's margins. If the sell-off accelerates in the session, it could be a function of some near-term margin concerns as Nvidia ramps up production of its latest AI chip, Blackwell. Usually, during ramp periods, costs are elevated and profit margins are not at peak levels. As Keybanc analyst John Vinh noted: "Nvidia noted it's supply constrained on Blackwell in the fiscal fourth quarter, and given the ramp of multiple platforms, expects gross margin to temporarily be in low 70s in fiscal first quarter 2026 before returning to mid-70s in the second half."

Title: Nvidia's market value is up 195% over 11 months. Is it still a good time to invest?

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. The offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us. That may influence which products we write about, but it does not affect what we write about them. Here's an explanation of how we make money and our Advertiser Disclosure. Nvidia (NVDA) stock opened the year at about $50 per share (on a split-adjusted basis). As of late November 2024, the AI hardware giant stock's price had eclipsed $145 — that growth equates to a year-to-date market value increase of almost 195%. When one of the world's largest companies nearly triples in value over 11 months, investors take notice. You might naturally wonder if Nvidia will keep growing and, if so, whether you can benefit. To help you decide if you should invest in Nvidia, let's review key factors from the company's last earnings release and the questions you should consider before placing a buy order. Learn more: How does Nvidia make money? Nvidia reported $35.1 billion in revenue and $0.81 in non-GAAP diluted earnings per share (EPS) in the third quarter. Revenue had increased by 94% from the prior-year quarter, and EPS rose 103% year over year. Learn more: Track Nvidia’s stock price here Notably, Nvidia generated nearly 88% of its revenue from its data center reporting segment, which includes the company's AI computing solutions. Data center revenues grew 112% year over year, outpacing the company's other three segments. Nvidia's gaming revenues grew 15%, professional visualization revenues were up 17%, and automotive and robotics revenues increased 72%. Nvidia first reported triple-digit data center revenue growth in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Now that the company has lapped those gains, comparisons will be more challenging going forward. Even so, Nvidia's leadership team expects more growth. The company's fourth quarter revenue guidance is $37.5 billion, plus or minus 2%. This compares to revenue of $22.1 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. The non-GAAP gross margin expectation for the upcoming quarter is 73.5%, plus or minus 50 basis points. Nvidia has held its non-GAAP gross margin over 70% throughout this recent growth phase, since the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Latest news: Nvidia earnings, forecasts top expectations as 'age of AI is in full steam' Nvidia plans to ship its most powerful graphics processing units, or GPUs, to date later this year. The launch is one for investors to watch. According to Nvidia, the next-generation Blackwell chips will deliver more computing power with lower energy consumption than the company's industry-leading H100 chip. Nvidia recently reported positive test results for the Blackwell platform. Against MLPerf Training 4.1 industry benchmarks, Blackwell delivered up to 2.2 times more performance per GPU. MLPerf benchmarks are developed by a consortium of AI leaders from multiple disciplines to evaluate workloads for machine-learning workflows. If Blackwell chips live up to expectations, it could spark another wave of strong AI hardware demand. Video: Nvidia's Blackwell and what it means for AI chip demand in 2025 Nvidia has business momentum, but that does not solely justify a decision to invest. An ownership position in the chip designer only makes sense when it aligns with your risk tolerance, investing goals, and interests. Before you buy, test this alignment using the eight questions below. Nvidia lost 50% of its value in 2022. The company also fell nearly 83% in 2002 after the dot-com bubble burst. The stock recovered from both declines eventually, but Nvidia remains a high-volatility position. The potential for large value changes, up or down, should influence how much Nvidia stock, if any, you want to own. Diversifying your holdings beyond Nvidia provides some protection from future volatility. Consider setting a cap on your relative Nvidia exposure based on your risk tolerance. A conservative approach, for example, would be limiting the value of your Nvidia stock to 1% of your portfolio. At this allocation, Nvidia could fall dramatically, and your net worth would remain largely intact. Nvidia pays a dividend, but it is not a good dividend stock. The dividend yield of 0.03% compares poorly to yields on cash savings accounts and many other S&P 500 stocks. For comparison, the average cash deposit rate in the U.S. is 0.43% and the average dividend yield of the S&P 500 is 1.24% as of Nov. 19. If income is your primary investing goal, there are better options than Nvidia. Learn more: How to start investing: A step-by-step guide Nvidia's stock price is high relative to its historic sales and earnings. Investors buying Nvidia today largely believe the company's future earnings will justify the current price tag. This is a common rationale for growth stocks, but it comes with risk. Stocks that trade at high prices relative to earnings can be volatile. The stock price moves higher on investor optimism but may fall quickly if earnings fail to meet future expectations. If you prefer a safer approach, you could wait until Nvidia's price dips before you buy. As long as the decline is related to investor sentiment or a temporary circumstance, it should not affect the company's long-term potential. The optimistic outlook for Nvidia relies on continued AI infrastructure spending. Multiple researchers and analysts believe the AI technology buildout still has years of growth ahead. However, research and advisory firm Forrester notes that "only 20% of businesses reported earnings benefits from AI in 2024," despite billions spent on AI infrastructure in 2023. AI implementations must deliver returns, or the trajectory of spending on data center infrastructure will change. A spending decline could challenge Nvidia's efforts to meet investor expectations. The Department of Commerce has proposed new rules limiting the export of high-powered semiconductors and related technologies. The rules are intended to prevent foreign adversaries from developing technology that could threaten national security. Meanwhile, the U.S. is enforcing its existing export restrictions. In November 2024, the Department of Commerce ordered Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), a major supplier to Nvidia, to stop shipping high-powered chips to Chinese customers. Existing and new semiconductor export restrictions limit Nvidia's opportunity in China, which is a sizable market. Statista estimates the Chinese chip sales totaled $185 billion in 2023. If you intend to invest in Nvidia, plan on following these regulatory developments and evaluating their ongoing impact on the business. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), a Nvidia competitor, is also targeting the AI chip market. In recent years, AMD CEO Lisa Su has raised the company's R&D budget dramatically and made a string of acquisitions to broaden AMD's AI resources and expertise. AMD does not have a meaningful market share in AI chips today, but the company says its newest chip, the MI325X, is more powerful than Nvidia's H200. As a prospective Nvidia investor, you might consider analyzing a competitor like AMD to understand its capabilities and how they could affect Nvidia's prospects. Nvidia also faces competition from the major cloud computing providers: Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), and Amazon (AMZN). These tech giants, currently among Nvidia's largest customers, are developing their own AI chips to avoid being overly dependent on Nvidia. It is always smart to define your sell parameters before buying any stock, especially the volatile ones. Sell triggers can be positive developments that push the stock price higher and create profit-taking opportunities. Or, triggers can be negative circumstances that permanently dampen the company's outlook. Having documented sell triggers can discourage you from making an emotionally driven decision to liquidate. With Nvidia's history of price declines and recoveries, a rash decision to sell could leave you watching from the sidelines as the stock returns to growth. Only you can decide if the risks associated with Nvidia stock are worth the rewards. Learn the business, know your risk tolerance, and choose a position size that makes sense. Remember that you can always add to your Nvidia holdings once you become comfortable with its behavior.
