U.S. stock market futures rose today following the Federal Reserve's rate cut, with all three major indexes climbing in early trading. The Fed lowered interest rates by 25 basis points, marking its first cut of the year, and signaled the possibility of two more cuts in 2025, boosting investor sentiment. The rate cut helped lift optimism in sectors poised to benefit from lower borrowing costs, especially tech stocks, which contributed to the Nasdaq's stronger futures gain. The small-cap Russell 2000 futures also rose significantly, expected to thrive in a lower interest rate environment.
