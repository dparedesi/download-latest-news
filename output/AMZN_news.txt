Title: Magnificent 7 shake-up: Why Wall Street is reassessing Tesla's position and looking toward Netflix

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Tesla (TSLA) has work to do if it wants to remain among tech elites. Despite a surprising third quarter earnings report that sent the EV maker's stock surging — resulting in its biggest intraday jump in over a decade — Wall Street is once again reevaluating its inclusion in the Magnificent Seven. The group’s members — Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Tesla — dominated markets in 2023 and have returned as a potential key driver as third quarter earnings season gets underway. The group is expected to lead with 18.1% year-over-year earnings growth in Q3, and four of the stocks — Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta — are projected to be in the top 10 contributors to S&P 500 earnings growth, according to FactSet. The debate over Tesla has returned as concerns linger despite its earnings resurgence. Tesla's third quarter profits jumped 17%, a dramatic turnaround after two quarters of declines. That’s not enough for Wall Street: Strategists tell me it's still at risk of falling behind the rest of Big Tech due to overhyped fundamentals. Freedom Capital Markets chief global strategist Jay Woods likened Tesla to bitcoin, suggesting the stock trades more on “hopes and dreams” than fundamentals. “Tesla had its moment in the sun … to me, it's more like a Cisco (CSCO) or an Intel (INTC) during the dot-com bubble, and now we're moving on to other things,” Woods warned on Yahoo Finance’s Morning Brief. While CEO Elon Musk has often categorized Tesla as a tech company, the firm’s AI and robotics bets will likely take years to pay off. In the meantime, Tesla must rely on improving its core auto business — a stark contrast to its Magnificent Seven peers. “I've been in the tech sector since 1990, and I remember the Four Horsemen … We didn't add an auto stock with Cisco, Intel, Dell (DELL), and Microsoft,” longtime tech investor Dan Morgan told me. Tesla’s recent underperformance and high valuation further strain its standing among its Mag Seven peers. At nearly 73 times forward earnings per Yahoo Finance data, its forward price-to-earnings multiple far exceeds others in the group. As of Friday afternoon, just over 40% of analysts covering Tesla rated the stock a Buy, according to Bloomberg data, making Tesla the least favored Magnificent Seven stock among analysts. As far as Tesla’s replacement, Netflix has emerged as a strong contender. Wealth Enhancement Group’s Ayako Yoshioka noted to me that Netflix “makes the most sense,” as shares of the original FAANG member recently hit an all-time high, buoyed by strong earnings and solid guidance. Since the start of the year, the stock has surged 55%, behind only Nvidia and Meta in the Magnificent Seven. Portfolio Wealth Advisors’ Jesus Alvarado-Martinez told me being a member of the Mag Seven is all about being a “cash flow machine," and Netflix “fits the bill.” “Netflix’s free cash flow has been relentless … Magnificent earnings, magnificent free cash flow, and magnificent subscribers numbers,” Alvarado added. The streamer's free cash flow has steadily climbed since the pandemic, growing to $2.19 billion in the third quarter, up from $1.89 billion a year earlier. For 2023, its free cash flow totaled $6.93 billion, compared to $1.62 billion in 2022. Bank of America analyst Jessica Reif Ehrlich sees Netflix’s growing free cash flow as a “catalyst” for the stock and estimates free cash flow to rise to $8.9 billion in 2025 and $11.16 billion in 2026. As of Friday, analysts are overwhelmingly bullish on Netflix. 87% of analysts covering the stock rate it a Buy, while only 3% recommend selling the stock. While Tesla’s fate in the Magnificent Seven remains uncertain, Netflix’s recent surge reminds investors why it was once a favorite, further bolstering the case that now might be the right time to consider a switch-up in the dominant group.

Title: Walmart maintains the upper hand as it battles Target for Americans' wallets

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. In the battle for America's shoppers, Walmart (WMT) is still dominating Target (TGT). The world's biggest retailer continues to gain high-income shoppers in the face of sticky inflation while it expands its membership and advertising revenue. It's maintained its edge in value, offering grocery prices that are about 10% to 12% cheaper for an average basket of food, per Goldman Sachs analyst Kate McShane. "The Walmart thesis is they're really among the biggest and best retailers out there," Telsey Advisory Group's Joe Feldman told Yahoo Finance over the phone. The company is "well positioned when times are tough, they're well positioned when things are getting better." Walmart has done "a very good job going after a more affluent consumer and keep retaining their core customer" of lower- to middle-income consumers, Feldman added. Groceries make up 60% of US sales for Walmart but just 20% to 25% of Target's sales, per Morningstar analyst Noah Rohr. Go inside the fascinating leadership journey of Target CEO Brian Cornell Target has been trying to turn the tide, announcing a plan in May to cut prices on 5,000 goods, which Bank of America analyst Robert Ohmes said "brought a positive momentum to foot traffic for Target." This week, Target announced another price cut on 2,000 items ahead of the holiday. "We believe that additional pricing cuts could spur additional traffic as we enter the crucial Holiday shopping season. Overall, we view this announcement as positive for Target's top-line and comparable sales ahead," Jefferies analyst Corey Tarlowe wrote in a note to clients. Walmart isn't just competing with Target, but also supermarket chains, drug stores, and discount stores. In the latest quarter, its US same-store sales were up 4.3%, while Target's declined 2.0%. Investors have awarded the results. Walmart's stock is up 52% in 2024, compared to Target's 5% gain and the S&P 500's 23% gain. Walmart's edge in the food aisles continues to help counter soft sales in categories like toys, apparel, and electronics. "Discretionary has been down for the last 10 quarters," McShane said, with some signs of recovery at both retailers. In 2025, discretionary goods spending is expected to grow, which could be a boost for Target, said McShane. When it comes to branching into other high-margin businesses, like memberships, e-commerce, and retail advertising, Walmart also took a head start. The company launched its Amazon (AMZN) Prime competitor, Walmart+, in 2020 for $98 per year. Target only started its Target Circle 360 program this March for $99 a year. Both include same-day delivery, though Target has a $35 minimum. Walmart+ touts additional perks, like savings on Paramount+ subscriptions, 25% off Burger King digital orders, $0.10 off a gallon of gas at over 13,000 stations, pickup for returns at customers' homes, and even free tire repair. "What really happened with Target Circle is they didn't do a lot with Target Circle during the COVID years where they were over-performing everybody," Ohmes said. "They really had to get beyond COVID ... beyond the inventory issues they had in 2022, and that led to the clearance issues they had in 2023." Now Target is trying to invest more aggressively in its loyalty rewards and paid memberships. It's offering Circle members an extra 30 days for returns, plus same-day orders from dozens of retailers through the Shipt Marketplace. Last quarter, Walmart US saw its e-commerce sales jump 3%, boosted by store pickups and delivery. "Pickup is growing faster than our in-store or club sales, and delivery is growing even faster than pickup. Delivery accuracy and speed continue to improve," CEO Doug McMillon said on the earnings call. Target saw its digital sales jump 8.7% year over year. CEO Brian Cornell said its Drive Up and Target Circle 360 programs both grew sales in the low teens. He added that same-day services now make up two-thirds of its digital sales, with most customers opting for Drive Up, which brought in $2 billion in sales in Q2. Walmart Connect, the company's advertising business, has also been blooming. Its US revenue grew 30% year over year, with advertising sales by online marketplace sellers up nearly 50%. Target is trying to develop its own offering, Target Roundel. Cornell said it "continues to experience rapid growth based on the joint value it creates for both our guests and our vendors," with double-digit revenue growth. It's expected to grow in the "high teens" for the full fiscal year, after "more than 20% growth in 2023." Neither retailer has shared exact revenue figures for its ads business. For reference, Amazon's ad unit boasted a 20% revenue growth year over year last quarter, bringing $12.77 billion in Q2. Walmart's e-commerce marketplace is "getting very close to being profitable" at Walmart, said McShane. "There's more buy-in from the investor base [in] the alternative revenue streams that Walmart's been going after... that they are faster-growing and higher-margin businesses that should drive better profitability for the company longer term," McShane said. "Walmart's had a great year and they've been outperforming ... From a fundamental standpoint, all is going so well for them from a stock perspective. Plus, it doesn't look like we're done ... With the setup for this holiday season, everybody's searching for value. What better retailer gives value than Walmart?" Feldman said. — Brooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Meta (META) will report earnings after the market closes Wednesday, with investors watching whether the social media giant's stock can keep up its strong performance so far this year. Analysts expect Meta to post third-quarter revenue of $40.25 billion, surging nearly 18% year-over-year. Net income is projected to land at $13.56 billion or $5.20 per share, up from $11.58 billion or $4.39 per share a year ago. Meta shares popped after the social media giant reported in July that it's seen early gains from artificial intelligence (AI) to optimize user engagement, benefitting its ad business. Deutsche Bank analysts told clients earlier this month they expect Meta's AI-driven optimization campaign to continue to bring "durable ad wallet share gains.” Meta posted advertising revenue of $38.33 billion in the second quarter, with the Street consensus sitting at $39.54 for the third quarter. CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in July that Meta AI is "on track to be the most used AI assistant in the world by the end of the year.” In September, Meta released Llama 3.2, its most capable open-source AI model yet, in its efforts to compete with Microsoft-backed (MSFT) OpenAI, Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google, and Amazon-backed (AMZN) Anthropic. Ahead of the company's earnings call, Bank of America analysts called the social media giant a “top AI pick,” pointing to strong core ad growth, growing core app usage among younger users, and the capability of the company’s large language model. All but one of the 31 analysts covering Meta tracked by Visible Alpha hold a "buy" or equivalent rating for the stock, with an average price target of $612.34, implying about 7% upside from Friday's closing price. Meta shares have surged more than 60% since the start of the year, finishing Friday at $573.25.

Yesterday's hit stock has cooled a bit today—but it's still working its way higher. Shares of EV maker Tesla (TSLA) were up nearly 3% in early trading Friday to around $268, outperforming the benchmark S&P 500. (Read today's markets coverage here.) That's less dramatic than the numbers the stock turned in Thursday as the company saw its shares rise 22%, its biggest percentage gain in more than a decade, on the back of an earnings report and outlook investors cheered. Today's move has the stock on track for a weekly gain of about 21% from last Friday's close of $220.70. It has the company's market capitalization at around $840 billion, according to Visible Alpha data. Analysts tracked by Visible Alpha have yet to catch up to Tesla's latest ride higher, with their mean price target at about $232. It also comes as the other six of the so-called Magnificent Seven megacap tech shares—Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT) and Nvidia (NVDA)—rose, with all but Apple up more than 1% in recent trading. That would point toward general optimism ahead of quarterly financial results from Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta that are expected next week.

Title: Amazon's SWOT analysis: e-commerce giant's stock faces growth hurdles

Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) continues to dominate the e-commerce and cloud computing landscapes, but the tech giant faces mounting challenges as it seeks to maintain its robust growth trajectory. Recent analyst reports paint a picture of a company leveraging its strengths in retail and cloud services while grappling with intensifying competition and regulatory scrutiny. Amazon's core retail business has demonstrated resilience in the face of economic headwinds. The company's U.S. sales of apparel and footwear exceeded $68 billion in 2023, capturing a 13.2% share of all apparel sold in the U.S. and a 41.4% share of all apparel sold online. Analysts project continued growth in Amazon's softlines business, with expectations of a 12.6% increase to approximately $77 billion in 2024. However, there are signs of a slowdown in the company's retail momentum. The recent Prime Day event saw a deceleration in growth, with Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) growing by only 5% compared to the previous year's 25% growth. Additionally, Amazon's Total Addressable Market (TAM) growth share slowed to 16% in Q2 of 2024, indicating a normalization after the rapid acceleration experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company's cloud computing division, has shown signs of renewed vigor. Revenue growth for AWS has seen an uptick from 12% in Q2 2023 to 19% in Q2 2024. This acceleration is attributed to reduced optimization headwinds and increased demand for generative AI services. Analysts believe the future growth of AWS hinges on the trajectory of generative AI demand, particularly compute usage for training and inference, as well as adoption of Amazon's own AI products. While there is optimism about AWS's growth potential due to AI, the return on invested capital (ROIC) for generative AI at scale remains unproven, leading some analysts to project conservative high-teens percentage growth for AWS over the next few quarters. Amazon's advertising business has emerged as a significant profit driver, with the potential to reshape the company's financial profile. The introduction of ads on Prime Video, along with an ad-free tier option, is expected to contribute approximately $1.95 billion in incremental advertising revenue in 2024, growing to over $10 billion by 2028. The company's vertically integrated full-stack advertising platform is considered capable of delivering a range of advertising solutions from upper to lower funnel. Amazon's Prime membership provides valuable data and attribution capabilities, potentially unmatched by competitors. Some analysts believe the consensus may be underestimating Amazon's potential to gain market share in advertising, which could lead to more leverage in its e-commerce cost structure. Amazon continues to invest in long-term growth initiatives that could reshape its business model. Project Kuiper, the company's satellite internet service provider business, is expected to begin launching satellites by late 2024 with a significant portion in orbit by July 2026 and the full constellation by July 2029. While the estimated $10 billion investment in Project Kuiper is substantial, analysts consider it reasonable over a 3-4 year period given Amazon's robust operating income. Another area of focus is the company's investment in electric and autonomous vehicles. Amazon could potentially save approximately $20 billion annually by deploying autonomous electric vehicles for middle-mile transport and replacing internal combustion engine delivery vans with electric Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) vans. Electric vehicles can reduce per-mile energy costs by nearly 50%, and autonomous technology could lower driver-related costs, which represent over 40% of the cost per mile in middle-mile delivery. Despite its dominant position, Amazon faces increasing competition from both traditional retailers and new entrants. Walmart (NYSE:WMT) continues to gain market share in the retail space, while companies like Temu and Shein are emerging as formidable competitors in the e-commerce sector. The potential closure of the de minimis loophole could negatively impact Temu's unit economics, which are already unsustainable with losses of $35-40 per order. While this could benefit Amazon in the short term, it also highlights the volatile nature of the competitive landscape. Regulatory scrutiny remains a concern for Amazon, particularly regarding antitrust issues. The company's vast reach across multiple industries and its market power in e-commerce and cloud computing have drawn the attention of regulators in various jurisdictions. This ongoing scrutiny could potentially impact Amazon's ability to pursue certain strategic initiatives or acquisitions in the future. Amazon's retail business, while dominant, operates on relatively thin margins. The emergence of aggressive competitors like Temu and Shein, along with the continued strength of traditional retailers like Walmart, could put pressure on these margins. These competitors may force Amazon to engage in price wars or increase spending on marketing and customer acquisition, potentially eroding profitability. Moreover, as the e-commerce market matures, the cost of customer acquisition and retention may rise. Amazon may need to invest more heavily in its Prime program and other loyalty initiatives to maintain its market share, which could further impact margins. The company's ongoing investments in fulfillment and logistics, while necessary for long-term competitiveness, also represent significant costs that could weigh on profitability in the near term. Amazon's size and market power have attracted increasing regulatory attention in recent years. Antitrust concerns, particularly regarding the company's dual role as both a marketplace operator and a seller on its own platform, could lead to regulatory actions that limit Amazon's ability to leverage its various business segments. Potential outcomes of regulatory scrutiny could include forced divestitures of certain business units, restrictions on data usage across different segments, or limitations on Amazon's ability to promote its own products on its platform. Such actions could significantly impact the company's business model and growth prospects. Additionally, increased regulatory compliance costs and potential fines could negatively affect Amazon's financial performance. Artificial intelligence and automation represent significant opportunities for Amazon to enhance efficiency and drive profitability across its various business segments. In its retail operations, AI can optimize inventory management, improve demand forecasting, and personalize customer experiences, potentially leading to higher sales and lower costs. In AWS, the growing demand for AI services presents a substantial revenue opportunity. As more companies seek to implement AI solutions, AWS is well-positioned to capture a significant share of this market. The integration of AI into Amazon's advertising platform could also lead to more effective ad targeting and higher ad revenues. Automation, particularly in Amazon's fulfillment centers and delivery operations, has the potential to significantly reduce labor costs and improve operational efficiency. The company's investments in autonomous vehicles and robotic systems could lead to substantial cost savings in the long term, potentially transforming the economics of e-commerce fulfillment. Project Kuiper, Amazon's satellite internet initiative, represents a significant long-term growth opportunity. While the initial investment is substantial, the potential market for global broadband internet access is vast. Analysts estimate that Project Kuiper could generate $2.8 billion in revenue by 2028, capturing a 17% market share of the satellite internet market. Beyond direct revenue from internet subscriptions, Project Kuiper could create synergies with Amazon's other business segments. It could expand Amazon's customer base by providing internet access to previously underserved areas, potentially increasing e-commerce sales and Prime subscriptions. Additionally, the satellite network could enhance Amazon's global logistics and data capabilities, supporting its retail and cloud computing operations. The project also positions Amazon to compete in the growing space economy, potentially opening up new revenue streams in areas such as satellite-based services for businesses and governments. While the full revenue potential of Project Kuiper may take years to materialize, it represents a strategic investment in Amazon's long-term growth and diversification. Amazon continues to navigate a complex landscape of opportunities and challenges as it seeks to maintain its position as a leader in e-commerce and cloud computing. While the company faces headwinds from increased competition and regulatory scrutiny, its diverse business model and investments in future technologies provide multiple avenues for growth. Investors and analysts will be closely watching Amazon's ability to execute on its strategic initiatives and maintain profitability in the face of evolving market conditions.

Title: Big Tech is going all in on nuclear power as sustainability concerns around AI grow

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Artificial Intelligence has driven shares of tech companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Nvidia (NVDA), and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to new highs this year. But the technology, which companies promise will revolutionize our lives, is driving something else just as high as stock prices: energy consumption. AI data centers use huge amounts of power and could increase energy demand by as much as 20% over the next decade, according to a Department of Energy spokesperson. Pair that with the continued growth of the broader cloud computing market, and you’ve got an energy squeeze. But Big Tech has also set ambitious sustainability goals focused on the use of low-carbon and zero-carbon sources to reduce its impact on climate change. While renewable energy like solar and wind are certainly part of that equation, tech companies need uninterruptible power sources. And for that, they’re leaning into nuclear power. Tech giants aren’t just planning to hook into existing plants, either. They’re working with energy companies to bring mothballed facilities like Pennsylvania’s Three Mile Island back online and looking to build small modular reactors (SMRs) that take up less space than traditional plants and, the hope is, are cheaper to construct. But there are still plenty of questions as to whether these investments in nuclear energy will ever pan out, not to mention how long it will take to build any new reactors. While solar and wind power projects provide clean energy, they still aren't the best option for continuous power. That, experts say, is where nuclear energy comes in. “Nuclear energy is, effectively, carbon-free,” explained Ed Anderson, Gartner distinguished vice president and analyst. “So it becomes a pretty natural choice given they need the energy, and they need green energy. Nuclear [power] is a good option for that.” The US currently generates the bulk of its electricity via natural gas plants that expel greenhouse gases. As of 2023, nuclear power produced slightly more electricity than coal, as well as solar power plants. Last week, Google signed a deal to purchase power from Kairos Power’s small modular reactors, with Google saying the first reactor should be online by 2030, with plants expected to be deployed in regions to power Google’s data centers, though Kairos didn’t provide exact locations. Amazon quickly followed by saying just two days later that it is investing in three companies — Energy Northwest, X-energy, and Dominion Energy — to develop SMRs. The plan is for Energy Northwest to build SMRs using technology from X-energy in Washington State and for Amazon and Dominion Energy to look at building an SMR near Dominion’s current North Anna Power Station in Virginia. Last month, Microsoft entered into a 20-year power purchasing agreement with Constellation Energy, under which the company will source energy from one of Constellation's previously shuttered reactors at Three Mile Island by 2028. Three Mile Island suffered a meltdown of its other reactor in 1979, but according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, there was no serious impact to nearby people, plants, or animals, as the plant itself kept much of the dangerous radiation from escaping. In 2023, Microsoft announced it would source power from the Sam Altman-chaired nuclear fusion startup Helion by 2028. Altman also chairs the nuclear fission company Oklo, which plans to build a micro-reactor site in Idaho. Nuclear fusion is the long-sought process of combining atoms that produces power without dangerous nuclear waste. No commercial applications of such plants currently exist. Microsoft founder Bill Gates has also founded and currently chairs TerraPower, a company working to develop an advanced nuclear plant at a site in Wyoming. Nuclear power output has remained stagnant for years. According to US Energy Information Administration press officer, Chris Higginbotham, nuclear power has contributed about 20% of US electricity generation since 1990. Part of the reason has to do with the fear of meltdowns, like the one at Three Mile Island, as well as the meltdowns at Chernobyl in Ukraine in 1986 and the Fukushima Daiichi plant in Japan in 2011. Chernobyl was the worst meltdown ever, spreading radioactive contamination across areas of Ukraine, the Russian Federation, and Belarus, resulting in thyroid cancer in thousands of children who drank milk that was contaminated with radioactive iodine, according to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Plant workers and emergency personnel were also exposed to high levels of radiation at the scene. The Fukushima plant suffered multiple meltdowns as a result of a massive earthquake and subsequent tsunami, which caused significant damage to three of the plant's six reactors. But according to the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) as of 2021, “no adverse health effects among Fukushima residents have been documented that could be directly attributed to radiation exposure from the accident.” Outside of the perception, nuclear plants are expensive and take time to construct. Georgia Power’s two Vogtle reactors came online in 2023 and 2024, after years of delays and billions in cost overruns. The reactors, known as Unit 3 and Unit 4 were originally expected to be completed in 2017 and cost $14 billion, but the second reactor only started commercial operations in April this year. The final price tag for the work is estimated to top out at $31 billion, according to the Associated Press. The explosion in cheap energy from natural gas has also made it difficult for nuclear plants to compete financially. Now nuclear companies are hoping SMRs will lead the way in building out new nuclear energy capacity. But don’t expect them to start popping up for a while. “The SMR conversation is really long term,” Jefferies managing director and research analyst Paul Zimbardo told Yahoo Finance. “I'd say almost all of the projections are into the 2030s. The Amazons, the Googles, some of the standalone SMR developers, 2030 to 2035, which is also what some of the utilities are saying as well.” What’s more, Zimbardo says, power generated by SMRs is expected to cost far more than traditional plants, not to mention wind and solar projects. “Some of the projections are well above $100 a megawatt hour,” Zimbardo explained. “To put it in context, an existing nuclear plant has a cost profile of around $30 a megawatt hour. Building new wind, solar, depending on where you are in the country, can be as low as $30 a megawatt hour, or $60 to $80 a megawatt hour. So it's a very costly solution.” Not everyone is buying the promise of SMRs, either. Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists, says the small-scale reactors are still an untested technology. “Despite what one might think of all the brain power at these tech companies, I don't think they've done their due diligence,” Lyman told Yahoo Finance. “Or they're willing to entertain this as a kind of side show just so they have all their bases covered to deal with this postulated massive expansion and demand for data centers.” Lyman also takes issue with the idea that SMRs will be able to get up and running quickly and begin providing reliable power around the clock at low cost. “The historical development of nuclear power shows that it's a very exacting technology, and it requires time, requires effort, requires a lot of money and patience,” he said. “And so I think the nuclear industry has been trying to make itself look relevant, despite their recent failures to meet cost and timeliness targets.” Still, with tech companies promising an AI revolution that requires power-hungry data centers, nuclear may be the only realistic green choice until solar and wind can take over permanently.
