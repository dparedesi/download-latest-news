Ulta (ULTA) shares are in the midst of a glow-up. The cosmetic company is attracting attention from investors, with analysts saying consumers are less likely to cut back on beauty purchases during tough economic times. Oppenheimer is one of the latest investment advisory groups to make this case ahead of Ulta’s earnings release slated for next week. Oppenheimer maintained its “outperform” rating of Ulta Tuesday and raised its target price to $465, which is 11% above the average target price among analysts who follow Ulta and were polled by Visible Alpha. Oppenheimer said Ulta appears poised to meet its financial targets and may benefit from limited exposure to tariffs and potential closures of Kohl’s (KSS) stores, which stock products from Sephora, a cosmetics company owned by LVMH Moët Hennessy. “We are encouraged by the strategic direction of the company under new CEO Kecia Steelman and are focused on management's execution of key digital priorities in the coming quarters to sustain the company's competitive position vs. [Amazon] AMZN, [Walmart] WMT, and others,” Oppenheimer said. The cosmetic company’s stock has shot up about 36% since mid-March when better-than-expected earnings and fresh leadership helped reverse a months-long decline. This puts shares at $420.50—or more than 8% above where they were a year ago. Wall Street is looking for a roughly 0.2% year-over-year increase in comparable store sales when Ulta shares its first-quarter results on May 29. Analysts surveyed by Visible Alpha expect profit of $267.3 million on net sales of $2.79 billion. A year ago, Ulta reported net income of $313.1 million on sales of $2.73 billion.
