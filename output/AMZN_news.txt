Technology Sending You to Google News in 3 © megaflopp / Shutterstock.com Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) apparently cannot help itself. Media reports say it plans to invest $10 billion into OpenAI. OpenAI, which until recently has been the leading artificial intelligence (AI) company in the world, has raised money from a long list of investors. Some are venture capitalists who are simply writing checks to get returns. However, another list consists of money or strategic deals with Microsoft, Oracle, Softbank, Nvidia, and, soon, Disney. What these tech investors are getting is a stake in a company that has had its spot at the top of the industry challenged by Gemini 3. That is an Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) offering. It is also one that the company says will not make money until 2030, one that will need hundreds of billions of dollars to hit its ambiguous goals, and one that has a growing number of direct competitors. These competitors include divisions of public companies, well-funded xAI and Anthropic, and a legion of smaller companies. Bloomberg reports, “OpenAI is in initial discussions to raise at least $10 billion from Amazon.com Inc. and use its chips, a potential win for the online retailer’s effort to broaden its AI industry presence and compete with Nvidia Corp.” Amazon is a tiny player in the AI chip business. Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) dominates, with a market cap of $4.33 trillion, which makes it the most valuable company in the world. Put plainly, the Amazon deal is part of the dangerous “round tripping” that goes on in the industry. One company invests in another. The company that gets the investment uses the money to buy products or services from the investor. Amazon clearly has little chance of competing head-to-head with Nvidia, so it is buying its way into the market. And Amazon can hardly say it is getting special treatment from OpenAI. The Financial Times reports, “OpenAI has already locked in $1.5tn in long-term deals with Nvidia, Oracle, AMD and Broadcom to supply chips and other computing infrastructure.” OpenAI does have one important strategic advantage in an Amazon deal. Like the rest of the AI world, it does not want to be trapped in a world where Nvidia is the only arms supplier. People have begun to ask whether the AI industry has created a valuation bubble. They are worried that the companies leading the race into AI will never make money. Many AI products are currently free. Investors worry that the data centers needed to run AI will take years to build and may not have enough electricity to run them. Still others believe that not all the large AI companies can survive in a brutally competitive market. The total of these investments will eventually move into the trillions of dollars. The Amazon deal with OpenAI is another example that the train has run off the rails.

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © LALAKA / Shutterstock.com Shares of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) are up about $3.55 in premarket. All on news OpenAI is in talks with the e-commerce giant about an investment that could exceed $10 billion. It could also include an agreement to use Amazon AI chips, too. This comes not long after OpenAI outlined the details of its relationship with Microsoft. According to CNBC, that relationship will also allow it to raise capital and partner with other AI companies. In addition, Amazon ran higher on news that it will invest $35 billion across India through 2030. By 2030, the investment is expected to quadruple exports to $80 billion. Technically, shares of Amazon just found support at $222.56, with overextensions on RSI, MACD, and Williams’ %R. From its last traded price of $222.56, we’d like to see the stock initially break through its 50-day moving average at around $229.25 a share. Helping, Oppenheimer raised its price target for AMZN from $290 to $305, noting that Amazon Web Services (AWS) could double its capacity through 2027, and serve as a key stock catalyst. Severely oversold shares of Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) are showing big signs of life, too. At the moment, it’s up about $2.35 a share in premarket. After gapping lower on AI data center spending fears, the tech giant appears to have caught strong support at $188.65. It’s also overextended on RSI, MACD, and Williams’ %R. From here, we’d like to see ORCL initially refill its bearish gap at around $220 a share. Longer-term, we’d like to see ORCL retest $260 a share. Fueling upside, Mizuho analysts say ORCL is among its top enterprise stocks for 2026. The firm says 2025 was a “transformative” year for the company, as it went from “an emerging cloud vendor into a key AI infrastructure player,” as quoted by Seeking Alpha. “We see Oracle as a [long-term] AI beneficiary given its end-to-end stack, including apps, its industry-leading database for mission-critical workloads, and OCI for AI training and inference,” they added. The firm also has an outperform rating on the stock with a price target of $400. Shares of Micron (NASDAQ: MU) are up about $4.40 a share in premarket. The company, which is expected to post earnings after the bell tonight, also received a buy rating from analysts at Needham. In fact, Needham analysts just reiterated a buy on MU with a price target of $300 a share. Meanwhile, Wells Fargo believes MU will benefit from the dynamic random-access market (DRAM), which is expected to grow by about 100%. Fueling upside, TrendForce just increased its 2025 and 2026 DRAM industry estimates, according to Wells Fargo. They now expect to see 2025 DRAM revenues of $165.7 billion, or 73% year-over-year growth. They also expect to see 2026 DRAM revenues of $333.5 billion, or 101% year-over-year growth. Technically, MU is challenging its 50-day moving average, which has served as support for the stock since September. From its last traded price of $232.51, we’d like to see MU retest its prior high of about $265 a share. Our top personal finance-related articles today. Your wallet will thank you later.
