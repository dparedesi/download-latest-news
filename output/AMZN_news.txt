Title: NVIDIA & Magnificent 7: Too Hot To Handle?

ByBill Stone, Contributor. As the dominant supplier of artificial intelligence (AI) chips, NVIDIA (NVDA) has become the largest company in the world and within the S&P 500 index. Following NVIDIA’s earnings last week, it’s an appropriate time to revisit the attractiveness of large technology stocks with a special emphasis on NVIDIA. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), collectively account for nearly 34% of the S&P 500’s market capitalization. Eight of the ten largest companies in the S&P 500 are technology companies, including Broadcom (AVGO). Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM) are the only non-technology companies in the top ten. Investors already appreciate the strong fundamentals of the Magnificent 7, and NVIDIA in particular, with stock returns far outstripping those of the S&P 500. The Magnificent 7 and NVIDIA have achieved total returns of 280% and 1,093%, respectively, since the start of the ChatGPT era at the end of 2022, while the S&P 500 has returned 75%. Based on the past twelve months of earnings and consensus earnings estimates for the next twelve months, the price-to-earnings ratios for all the Magnificent 7 stocks are above the S&P 500. While this ratio indicates that most of these companies have a higher valuation on both measures, it doesn’t answer whether other factors justify that premium. Another way to value companies is by their multiple revenues, which is called the price-to-sales ratio. All the Magnificent 7 are valued at price-to-sales ratios above the S&P 500, with NVIDIA at an almost twenty-seven times price-to-sales ratio. Historical annualized growth in sales over the last three and five years has been impressive for most of the group, but downright amazing for NVIDIA. Likewise, historical earnings per share growth has generally been impressive and exceptional, as seen in cases like NVIDIA. The five-year annualized earnings per share growth rate of the Magnificent 7 demonstrates just how unique these companies have been when compared to the stock market as a whole. Future earnings are the most crucial criterion when considering whether to buy or hold a stock. Consensus forecasts from Wall Street analysts still evidence significant optimism about NVIDIA’s earnings growth prospects, with 39% annualized growth expected from the world’s largest company. Separately, the sustainable growth rate for the group supports the future growth story. The sustainable growth rate theoretically indicates how fast a company can grow without borrowing additional funds while maintaining its existing capital structure. The profitability metrics of most of the Magnificent 7 are impressive. Gross margins represent the profitability after all direct expenses, specifically the cost of goods sold, have been deducted from sales. Operating margins measure how much a company earns on a dollar of sales after paying for the variable expenses, or the percentage of sales converted into operating income. NVIDIA converted almost seventy cents of every sales dollar into operating profit over the last year. While NVIDIA’s gross margin was about 70% over the previous year, it improved to 75% in the most recent quarter. Just looking at a simple high price-to-earnings ratio can be deceiving when analyzing a company with high returns on invested capital (ROIC). It is crucial to consider the return generated on the capital needed to fund a business, since a company with a sustainably higher ROIC should sell at a valuation premium. To put some of the impressive return on invested capital figures for the Magnificent 7 into proper perspective, the ROIC for the S&P 500 is around 8%. Furthermore, most companies in the Magnificent 7 generate substantial amounts of free cash flow, despite investing in growing businesses. The free cash flow margin indicates the percentage of revenue that the company can utilize or distribute to shareholders as free cash flow. NVIDIA is exceptional, with almost forty-four cents of every dollar in sales converted to free cash flow. The free cash flow yield refers to the free cash flow per share generated by a business, expressed as a percentage of its stock price. Value investors, such as Warren Buffett, value a company based on the cash that can be distributed from a business over its lifetime, discounted back to the present. Free cash flow can be a good measure of the money available to owners. A free cash flow yield below that of the S&P 500, such as the Magnificent 7 and NVIDIA, can be seen as investors already pricing in superior growth and durability of free cash flow relative to the market. NVIDIA is particularly notable given the massive increase in its market capitalization, which now exceeds $4.2 trillion, driven by the artificial intelligence spending wave. The consumer introduction of ChatGPT as an artificial intelligence tool in late 2022 coincided with a sharp rise in NVIDIA’s valuation, as the company became the dominant supplier of AI semiconductors. There has been some concern about NVIDIA’s relatively meager beat of consensus earnings estimates last week and less exceptional guidance than has been typical. There were zero sales to China in the quarter due to geopolitical tensions, which made for more challenging comparisons. For example, data center sales, which were impacted by China, declined by 1% quarter-over-quarter, but were up about 12% quarter-over-quarter excluding China, according to TD Cowen. Despite NVIDIA’s less optimistic forward guidance than was hoped, a resumption in sales to China could add $2 to $5 billion in sales. In the short term, NVIDIA’s dominance in high-end artificial intelligence computing appears untouchable, as its next-generation platform is on pace for meaningful production next year. Furthermore, the company continues to benefit from AI demand outstripping supply, alleviating concerns about potential pricing pressures. It appears likely that AI will be a transformative tool for businesses and households, generating substantial economic benefits. Although it is still early, indications suggest that artificial intelligence adoption is continuing at a brisk pace. The capital spending (capex) by AI-leaders, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft, to support complex computations needed to support AI, has seen a massive rise since 2023. NVIDIA reaped significant revenue from this spending as the leading chip provider for AI. Estimates are that capital spending by these four AI leaders will exceed $400 billion by 2026. What if demand for AI services doesn’t meet expectations or the firms are unable to monetize the services at a profitable enough level? Capital expenditures (capex) budgets can indeed be slashed if needed. This downside risk isn’t a forecast, but it must be considered when evaluating NVIDIA and all AI-connected technology stocks. Notably, these sizable capital expenditures are more sustainable than some past instances, because the companies are highly profitable and can self-fund rather than depending on the charity of lenders or additional capital. Though it is nowhere in sight, one must always be wary of some competing technology eventually displacing NVIDIA as a dominant leader. Capitalism subjects companies to intense competition in their pursuit of profits, and the profits generated by technology leaders make them an attractive target. The bullish case for large tech and NVIDIA is bolstered by the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). The mega-cap technology stocks, represented by the Magnificent 7, continue to produce earnings and free cash flow at impressive rates. Large technology stocks typically exhibit exceptional profitability compared to the average stock and should therefore trade at a premium valuation. The rise in the stock prices of the Magnificent 7, including NVIDIA, has been supported by robust fundamentals and not just a promise of future profitability. Investors buy or hold companies for their future profits, not their past performance. The past is only significant to the extent that it informs the firm’s future prospects. While one needs to remain mindful of risk, the robust adoption rate of artificial intelligence, combined with companies’ ability to self-fund the massive costs required to build AI infrastructure, implies that the end is not yet here. Investors should be mindful of the risk associated with concentrated holdings, given the remarkable growth of some of these technology leaders.

Title: What’s Driving Amazon Stock To New Highs?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. In early 2023, Amazon's stock (NASDAQ: AMZN) was trading at a modest $84. Today, it has soared to $232, a stunning 176% jump that significantly outpaces the broader NASDAQ index's 2x rise. So, what's fueling this incredible surge? The answer lies in three critical factors: But the question remains: Can this powerhouse performance continue? We’ll dive into what’s driving this momentum and what the future holds for Amazon. But if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Separately, see – CoreWeave Stock To $200? Beyond its sheer size, Amazon's revenue growth is driven by a hidden engine: a powerful shift in its business model. While its e-commerce sales are impressive, they are no longer the primary force. The real story lies in the company's strategic diversification, with three key areas serving as the main catalysts for its recent surge. The undisputed heavyweight champion of Amazon's growth is Amazon Web Services (AWS). This cloud computing arm has proven to be an exceptionally valuable asset, far outpacing the growth of Amazon's traditional retail operations. While North American and international sales grew by 23% and 21% respectively between 2022 and 2024, AWS revenue surged by a solid 34% over the same period. Its high-margin, scalable services for businesses, governments, and individuals make it the company's most important growth engine. Another crucial, and often overlooked, driver of Amazon's financial success is its rapidly expanding digital advertising business. Much like Google and Meta, Amazon has leveraged its vast customer data and massive platform to become a dominant player in the ad world. This segment, which includes sponsored product listings and display ads, has been growing at a remarkable pace, providing a high-profit-margin revenue stream that diversifies the company's earnings beyond e-commerce and cloud services. Amazon's third major growth driver is its subscription services, most notably its Prime membership, which has evolved into a comprehensive ecosystem of benefits beyond free shipping to include streaming video and music, exclusive deals, and more. This has created a loyal and engaged customer base that not only pays a recurring fee but also spends more on Amazon's platform than non-Prime members. This steady, predictable revenue stream provides a solid financial foundation and strengthens the company's competitive moat. Looking ahead, these drivers face a new challenge: the intense competition in the AI arms race. AWS's leadership in cloud computing is being challenged by rivals like Microsoft (Azure) and Google (Cloud), who are making massive investments in generative AI. Microsoft's partnership with OpenAI and Google's rapid expansion of AI services pose a significant threat. To maintain its market leadership, Amazon is also pouring tens of billions into AI-related capital expenditures, a strategic move that will shape its future and determine if its extraordinary growth can continue. Amazon's stunning rise in valuation can be attributed to its dramatic financial transformation, where a once-unprofitable e-commerce giant has become a profit-making powerhouse. This shift has reshaped investor sentiment and sent its valuation soaring. The most significant catalyst behind this change is AWS. This high-margin cloud business has single-handedly revolutionized Amazon's profitability. Since 2022, Amazon's operating margin has skyrocketed by an astounding 377%, climbing from a meager 2.4% to a robust 11.4%. This incredible expansion in profitability, fueled by AWS, is the key reason investors are now willing to pay a premium for Amazon's stock. It signals a new era of sustainable, high-quality earnings. This surge in profitability, combined with strong revenue growth and the strategic expansion of AWS, has directly impacted Amazon’s valuation. Investors now value the company as a technology and cloud leader. As a result, the company's price-to-sales valuation multiple has ballooned by 124%, jumping from 1.7x trailing revenues in 2022 to an impressive 3.7x today. This multiple expansion is a direct reflection of the market's newfound confidence in Amazon's long-term profit potential. At its current price of around $230, Amazon's stock is trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 3.7x, which aligns closely with its five-year average of 3.2x. However, there are compelling reasons to believe the valuation multiple could expand further. See, AI is not just a buzzword for Amazon; it's a strategic weapon poised to supercharge its growth and reshape its financial future. The company's massive investments in artificial intelligence are set to ignite a new wave of expansion across its entire business empire. Within AWS, AI is the new frontier. As businesses race to develop and deploy their own AI applications, they are driving unprecedented demand for AWS's cloud infrastructure. This isn't just about incremental growth; it's a direct catalyst for skyrocketing cloud sales, solidifying AWS's position as a profit powerhouse. In fact, if you want a detailed breakdown of how this growth can help Amazon's stock, take a look at our analysis – Amazon Stock: Path to 2x Growth – which highlights the key factors. But the AI revolution isn't limited to the cloud. On the retail side, AI is being woven into the very fabric of the shopping experience. Think smarter product recommendations, lightning-fast search, and deeply personalized storefronts. These aren't just minor upgrades—they're powerful tools designed to boost sales, increase the value of every order, and make advertising on the platform more effective than ever. This enhanced ad targeting will also extend its influence across the wider digital advertising landscape, creating a lucrative new revenue stream. All of this adds up to a compelling financial outlook. Amazon projects low double-digit sales growth over the next three years, with its bottom-line profits expected to grow even faster. This blend of accelerating profitability, continued AWS dominance, and an ironclad grip on the e-commerce market, presents a powerful case for a higher valuation. Investors are already taking notice, recognizing that Amazon's strategic AI initiatives are not just a plan—they're the blueprint for a new era of growth and value creation. Despite its powerful rise, Amazon’s stock is not without its vulnerabilities. Its history is marked by sharp drops that have far outpaced the broader market, highlighting both its inherent volatility and remarkable resilience. During the 2022 inflation-driven market sell-off, Amazon stock plunged a staggering 52%, a far steeper decline than the S&P 500's 25% drop. The stock's recovery took over a year, not regaining its previous high until February 2024. More recently, during periods of heightened trade war concerns, the pattern repeated—Amazon plummeted 30% while the S&P 500's peak-to-trough decline was a more modest 19%. This history shows that when markets turn, Amazon can fall harder and faster than its peers. Beyond market-wide shocks, the company faces significant company-specific risks. A primary concern is its massive capital expenditure. Since 2022, Amazon has invested a colossal $257 billion in CapEx. This is a high-stakes gamble, and a critical question looms: What if these massive investments don't yield the returns investors expect? Simultaneously, the explosive growth of its core profit driver, AWS, could be threatened by intense competition from rivals like Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. A slowdown in AWS growth, combined with concerns over the payback on its huge investments, could create a challenging scenario. For a deeper dive into these risks, including the factors that could cause a severe downturn, we've captured a full downside scenario in our separate analysis: How Amazon Stock Falls By 50%? See, there always remains a meaningful risk when investing in a single, or just a handful, of stocks. Consider the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Wall Street Largely Cheers Nvidia's Outlook Even as China Remains an Overhang

Nvidia’s (NVDA) results and outlook elicited a mixed response from Wall Street analysts on Thursday, with some cheering the chip giant's revenue forecast and others lamenting uncertainty around sales to China. The poster child for the AI boom on Wednesday projected third-quarter revenue of $54 billion, plus or minus 2%. The forecast exceeded Wall Street's official estimate of $53.8 billion, but by a narrower margin than many investors have come to expect. Nvidia issued its guidance as it posted better-than-estimated second-quarter results, although key data center revenue lagged forecasts. Nvidia shares are down around 2% in early trading on Thursday, but have retraced larger after-hours declines following the results. Morgan Stanley raised its price target on the stock to $210 from $206 and kept its overweight call, saying Nvidia shares are "less expensive than other AI beneficiaries." They said the "bar [set by Nvidia] continues to be high but the growth acceleration is clear." “For the stock to sell off slightly after hours on these types of numbers certainly indicates that sentiment has largely caught up to the growth potential, after fears of digestion just a few weeks ago,” they wrote. “But outside of China geopolitics, this is a very clean beat and raise quarter." Nvidia CFO Collette Kress said during the earnings call Wednesday that the company hasn't restarted sales of its H20 chips in China yet while the company waits for the U.S. government to formalize its revenue-sharing agreement. Earlier this year, the Trump administration blocked Nvidia’s sale of its H20 chips, which the company tailored for the Chinese market, then this month struck a deal where Nvidia would give the government 15% of China chip revenues in exchange for resumed sales. UBS analysts said they were optimistic on the prospects the rally in the AI-driven bull market would continue after Nvidia's results. “The overall strength of the July quarter results may offer some reassurance for investors after signs of stalling momentum for the large-cap tech rally,” UBS analysts wrote, adding that “the outlook for large-cap tech remains compelling.” Several of Nvidia’s major Big Tech clients, including Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), have committed to spending big on their AI capacity, and Nvidia said Wednesday that one customer spent more than $10 billion last quarter. Kress said late Wednesday that the chipmaker anticipates $3 trillion–4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by the end of the decade. HSBC was less upbeat, however, saying Nvidia hasn't delivered a "beat and raise" quarter since its second-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings last year. "We maintain our Hold rating as we expect the near-term supply inconsistency and China uncertainty to remain an overhang," they wrote. Even Morgan Stanley analysts noted that prospects for a resumption of China sales are unclear, and that uncertainties remain around the 15% revenue deal with the government and the need for Beijing to give the green light to resume chip sales. China accounted for 20% of Nvidia’s data center revenue at one point and “while it remains a large market, we simply don’t know how large it will be when it comes back, or if it comes back at all," the analysts wrote. UPDATE—This article has been updated with the latest share price information.
