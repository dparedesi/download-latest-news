Nvidia stock (NVDA) jumped as much as 2.7% early Thursday as Wall Street analysts reiterated their Buy ratings on the stock despite concerns about rising competition and the possibility that artificial intelligence chip demand could wane. Over the past few days, Wall Street analysts at Bernstein, TD Cowen, Morgan Stanley, and Truist have maintained bullish outlooks on the company. “All relevant industry contacts support the dominance and superiority of NVDA's full technology stack,” Truist Securities’ William Stein wrote on Monday. He raised his price target on the stock to $204 from $169. Following the nods from Wall Street, Nvidia shares rallied as much as 4.8% Wednesday. But the stock later reversed direction, ending the day down roughly 1%, as stocks fell across the board following commentary from the Federal Reserve projecting fewer rate cuts and stickier inflation in 2025. Even with Thursday's early morning gain, Nvidia stock is still off roughly 11% from its record close of $148.88 in early November. Nvidia shares have fallen as investors worry its GPUs could lose share in the broader AI chip market given that its customers are developing their own custom chips. Google (GOOG) and Meta (META) have developed chips with Broadcom (AVGO). Microsoft (MSFT), Tesla (TSLA), and Amazon (AMZN) also make their own custom chips. Broadcom’s announcement that it’s developing chips for two more clients, who are believed to be ChatGPT-maker OpenAI and Apple (AAPL), boosted the chipmaker’s stock last week and sent Nvidia’s in the opposite direction. These custom chips, called ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits), could potentially threaten Nvidia’s GPUs, given that they are cheaper and tailored to a tech company’s specific AI needs. A Morgan Stanley report released on Dec. 15 showed that custom chips used to run cloud AI services could grow their share of the overall AI chip market from 11% in 2024 to 15% in 2030. Still, Morgan Stanley said, “history is certainly on Nvidia's side” when it comes to maintaining dominance of the AI chip market. “We think ASICs have continued to improve, but Nvidia's strong execution continues to raise the bar for its competitors." It's a point on Nvidia that Bank of America semiconductor analyst Vivek Arya reiterated Wednesday in an episode of the Opening Bid podcast (video above). Additionally, concerns loom that the Big Tech spending on AI chips that fueled Nvidia's rise could slow down. Commentary from Microsoft and Google in their most recent earnings reports indicated that their AI spending will grow at a slower pace in the future. And there are concerns that AI models are no longer improving at their previous breakneck pace, which could also put a damper on investment. TD Cowen analyst Joshua Buchalter said the firm's recent meeting with Nvidia showed the chipmaker is aware of that concern but "remains confident in the industry's ability to progress and continue to innovate." Stein also believes Nvidia will announce a standalone CPU, or central processing unit — the “brain” of a computer, distinct from Nvidia’s Hopper and Blackwell GPUs, or graphics processing units — in 2025, opening up what he sees as a $35 billion market opportunity. Nvidia currently uses its Arm-based Grace CPUs alongside its Blackwell GPUs in servers it sells to customers but does not sell CPUs individually. Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Title: Walmart had a gangbusters year

Walmart (WMT) has delivered an exceptional year that has transformed its market position. The retailer’s shares surged more than 80% in 2024, pushing its market value to $768 billion after adding $340 billion in market capitalization. The retail giant’s exceptional performance has been driven by its success in attracting wealthier shoppers and growth in advertising and marketing revenue, allowing it to emerge as one of the top performers on the S&P 500 Consumer Staples Index. While inflation has challenged most retailers in 2024, Walmart has turned market headwinds into an advantage, delivering its strongest performance since 1998. The retailer’s share price gains and margin growth have outpaced most traditional retail competitors, drawing comparisons to higher-growth industries. Keith Buchanan, senior portfolio manager at GLOBALT Investments, told Bloomberg that Walmart’s stock “looks more like something that’s technologically oriented,” referring to its robust growth and profitability, which rival those of the historically high-performing tech giants. This tech-like performance comes as Walmart ramps up its digital capabilities. With its continued investment in technology, product offerings, and supply chain operations, Baird analysts project Walmart will compete directly with Amazon in the coming years. This positioning highlights Walmart’s influence as it continues to attract shoppers of all income cohorts – especially wealthier ones. In the most recent quarter, around 75% of Walmart’s sales came from households earning $100,000 a year or more. To court those more affluent shoppers, Walmart has modernized its stores with refreshed layouts, expanded product assortments, and improved lighting while rolling back prices on more than 7,000 items to maintain momentum with budget-conscious customers. “Walmart has found a sweet spot,” Greg Zakowicz, senior e-commerce expert at software company Omnisend, told Quartz in an interview. “It’s successfully serving both higher-income shoppers looking to save on groceries and lower-income shoppers seeking the best value.” These updates have positioned Walmart to compete across the retail spectrum. While its enhanced shopping experience puts pressure on Target (TGT) and Amazon (AMZN), the company is also targeting the discount retail space. Citigroup’s (C) Paul Lejuez suggests that Walmart’s expanded offerings and focus on delivery, coupled with its Walmart+ Assist program for low-income customers, will allow it to take market share from retailers like Dollar General (DG). Earlier this month, Dollar General said it would test same-day delivery at 75 locations to keep up with Walmart. Moreover, Walmart’s reliance on its advertising and membership revenue, which make up nearly one-third of its operating income, has given it room to reduce prices while growing its margins. RBC Capital Markets (RY) analyst Steven Shemesh noted that these pursuits set Walmart apart from other retailers struggling to achieve similar growth. That said, not all analysts expect Walmart’s gangbusters year to extend into 2025. Redburn Atlantic analyst Daniela Nedialkova warns that given macroeconomic pressures, next year may not replicate the stellar stock gains seen this year.

Title: Nvidia's Blackwell chip could push the company into a new stratosphere as the AI revolution continues

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia stock (NVDA) is on pace for a comfortable triple-digit percentage gain again in 2024, after a nearly 240% surge in 2023. This year's rise is due in no small part to a product that wasn’t even shipped until the last quarter of the year — Blackwell. It’s the largest GPU (graphics processing unit) ever built, created by connecting two dies via a high bandwidth interface (HBI). In layperson’s terms, that translates to a lot of power at high efficiency, which is why it's been in such demand from the so-called hyperscalers — companies like Alphabet (GOOG) and Microsoft (MSFT) that are building out huge data centers to power large language models (LLMs). That hot demand for Blackwell and the 170% surge in Nvidia shares is what led Yahoo Finance to name the chip its 2024 Product of the Year. Read more: Here's why Walmart won the 2024 Yahoo Finance Company of the Year award “Technically, Blackwell is a beast,” Matt Kimball, an analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, told Yahoo Finance in an email. “Blackwell is an exponential leap forward as it is a dual GPU on a single chip with faster connectivity, a larger pool of high bandwidth memory (HBM3E), and the introduction of NVIDIA’s decompression engine to make data processing much faster (up to 6x relative to Hopper).” First announced in March, Blackwell is in the right place at the right time. Data centers that power generative AI or LLMs are currently occupied with inputting data and training those models. Blackwell and its predecessor, Hopper, are well-suited for that work. Blackwell represents an enormous advancement in power. It contains 208 billion transistors, more than two and a half times the number in Hopper. Its GB200 NVL72 server, which combines 72 Blackwell GPUs with 36 Grace CPUs, clocks up to a 30x performance increase compared to the same number of Hopper GPUs for LLM inference workloads. It also uses up to 25x less energy. “For us to leapfrog ourselves by an order of magnitude is pretty unheard of,” Dion Harris, director of accelerated data center, HPC (high-performance computing), and AI at Nvidia, said in a phone interview. “We were limited by physics, but we recognized that innovation with the HBI would allow us to extend the die-level communication and compute.” US business spending on generative AI has sextupled in a year, going from $2.3 billion in 2023 to $13.8 billion in 2024, according to Menlo Ventures. And the trend is only going up, as major companies from banking and retail to tech and hospitality race to introduce advanced chatbots and assistants to their customers. Nvidia's clients are paying dearly for their chips. The company doesn't break out Blackwell sales specifically, but KeyBanc analyst John Vinh estimates that Blackwell will account for $4 billion to $5 billion in sales in the current quarter. "After Q4, we should start to see a pretty quick ramp," he said in a phone interview. "For next year, we’re modeling $187 billion in compute data center revenues, of which 80% of that should be Blackwell." "Having such dominant market share, they have pricing power," he added. "As a hyperscaler, you pretty much have to pay Nvidia whatever they want." Nvidia’s rivals such as AMD (AMD) and even Amazon (AMZN) are working hard to develop their own alternatives. How long the GPU giant’s AI chip dominance can last has been up for debate ever since its shocking upside revenue beat in May 2023. Those questions have gotten louder as of late. Its shares have pulled back 12% from their record close on Nov. 7. And since the beginning of December, other semiconductor news has been getting buzz, including Amazon’s Trainium2 and Nova semiconductors. Broadcom (AVGO) has been gaining steam following its earnings report, catapulting its market cap to over $1 trillion. The crux of the excitement is the company's contract AI chip business, which CEO Hock Tan said would reach a "total serviceable market" of $60 billion to $90 billion by 2027. That said, "No one has been able to come out with a successful custom solution" that matches Nvidia's, Vinh said. Because Nvidia's earnings have been growing at a rapid clip alongside its share price, its valuation has remained competitive with other chipmakers. Its forward price-to-earnings ratio, for example, stands at nearly 31, compared to 25 for AMD and 46 for Broadcom, according to Yahoo Finance data. Companies like Amazon remain Nvidia customers even as they develop competing products. Nvidia dominates the market for training generative AI models — accounting for roughly 85% share — “and they’re not losing,” said Ben Bajarin, CEO of Creative Strategies. But once that training is complete, the models will turn to inference — putting all that information they’ve digested and learned to work. The power needed for inference is generally lower than that of training, though Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has consistently maintained that his company’s chips are well-suited to that stage as well. One factor in whether customers will continue to buy is cost. In addition to being the most advanced chips, Nvidia’s are also the most expensive. The company touts its TCO, or total cost of ownership, emphasizing computing power relative to energy usage over the life of the chips. “I doubt they’ll have the same market share they have today in inference,” Bajarin said. “There will be much more competition for inference.” Thus far, however, Nvidia’s biggest point of friction has been its own supply chain. A chip of Blackwell’s complexity and power has hit manufacturing and design snags, as Huang has acknowledged. After delays, the chip is expected to ship this Q4 and ramp up production next year. “Blackwell production is in full steam,” Huang said in the company's latest earnings call. “I think we're in great shape with respect to the Blackwell ramp at this point.” Still, the company said demand will exceed supply for several quarters. Nvidia's pace of overall sales growth is predicted to slow over the next year, a factor of the "law of large numbers," Jordan Klein, analyst at Mizuho Group, said in an email. Nvidia's sales rose by 126% in calendar 2023 over the prior year. They'll rise by 111% this year, according to analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, and 52% next year. "Nothing to worry about really, demand still exceeds supply," Klein said.
