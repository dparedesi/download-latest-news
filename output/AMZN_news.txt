We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks mostly rose on Friday as investors digested the last monthly jobs report of the year, a crucial test of the prospects for interest rate cuts in December and beyond. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) lost about 0.3%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose roughly 0.3%. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) increased 0.8% as Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), and Meta (META) gained, tapping all-time intraday highs. The daily results of the major gauges also reflected their weekly performances. The Dow shed 0.6% for the week, while the S&P 500 gained close to 1%. The Nasdaq climbed more than 3%. The US economy added 227,000 jobs in November, slightly more than expected, as the labor market rebounded from October data that was dinged by severe weather and labor strikes. The unemployment rate unexpectedly ticked up to 4.2%. Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer has all the details here. The report largely matched hopes for a "Goldilocks" reading — strong enough to dampen concerns about the economy but soft enough to keep the Fed's options open on lowering rates this month and into next year. On Friday, markets were pricing in near-90% odds the Fed lowers rates by a quarter percentage point on Dec. 18, per the CME FedWatch Tool, compared with about 70% before the report. Meanwhile, the rally in bitcoin (BTC-USD) continued after slipping, trading around $101,000 Friday afternoon. Options show some investors are hedging against a deeper pullback after the leading token's record-breaking surge to over $100,000 for the first time. The rally has been spurred by hopes of support for digital currencies from President-elect Donald Trump, who on Thursday named former PayPal (PYPL) COO David Sacks as his "White House AI & Crypto Czar." On the corporate front, shares of Lululemon (LULU) and Ulta Beauty (ULTA) jumped after the retailers both boosted profit forecasts. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy US stocks mostly rose on Friday and notched gains for the week as investors took the latest monthly jobs report as a sign that the Fed will likely cut interest rates again later this month. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) lost about 0.3%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose roughly 0.3%. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) increased 0.8%, with several tech giants touching new highs. The daily results of the major gauges also reflected their weekly performances. The Dow shed 0.6% for the week, while the S&P 500 gained close to 1%. The Nasdaq climbed more than 3%. If Friday's labor market reading likely kept the Federal Reserve on track to cut interest rates later this month, next week's inflation reading is perhaps the final key data point that could alter that storyline. On Wednesday, a closely watched report on US inflation will give the Federal Reserve another glimpse into consumer prices before they are set to meet for their last policy huddle of the year. If the Consumer Price Index (CPI) surprises to the upside, that might pressure central bankers to halt their interest rate cutting. But as of Friday afternoon, Wall Street largely expects the Fed to cut rates by another quarter percentage. The economic calendar also includes wholesale inventories and the import price index. A handful of major corporate names are set to deliver earnings reports next week. Among the tickers are GameStop (GME), Macy's (M), Costco (COST), and Broadcom (AVGO). Yahoo Finance's Brent Sanchez has a graphical breakdown of what to watch next week: TikTok's loss is Meta (META)'s gain. Shares of Facebook's parent company rose nearly 3% Friday afternoon following a US appeals court decision that upheld a law banning TikTok from operating in the US under Chinese ownership. The decision, which could be overturned by the Supreme Court, increases the likelihood that the short-form video app will be banned in the US. That would seriously diminish a rising competitor to American social media and digital advertising platforms. The stocks of several US tech giants rose on the news. Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), the corporate parent of Google and YouTube, gained 1%. TikTok's future isn't set, however. In addition to the legal challenges that ByteDance could pursue, there is also the unknown of what resident-elect Trump could do. As Yahoo Finance's Alexis Keenan reports, his statements on the campaign trail suggest he may at least try to tinker with the impact of the law. Here are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance’s trending tickers page during afternoon trading on Friday: Lululemon (LULU): Shares of the athletic apparel company soared Friday afternoon on the back of strong third quarter results. Lululemon raised its full-year revenue forecast after beating estimates across the top and bottom line, thanks in large part to the brand's strength in international markets. Palantir (PLTR): The big data analytics company rose more than 5% Friday after signing a new AI partnership with defense contractor Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH). Palantir is up more than 300% so far this year, riding the momentum of advancements in AI technology. Shopify (SHOP): Shares of the e-commerce platform gained 5% Friday following an upgrade from Loop Capital from a Hold to a Buy, nodding to the company's use of AI. Loop raised its price target to $140, reflecting a 23% potential upside to the stock. Ulta Beauty (ULTA): The cosmetic store chain is rallying after the company beat third quarter earnings estimates Thursday and as executives raised their forecasts for full-year earnings. Net sales for the quarter increased by 1.7% to $2.5 billion. Shares rose 10% Friday afternoon. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) shot up above $101,000 at around 1:10 p.m. ET on Friday after falling below the $100,000 milestone level. On Thursday evening President-elect Donald Trump announced venture capitalist David Sacks will be his incoming administration's "AI and crypto czar." Bitcoin reached new highs late Wednesday, surpassing $100,000 for the first time following Trump’s nomination of Paul Atkins to chair the Securities and Exchange Commission. Atkins is seen as a crypto-friendly pick for the position. The token cleared $103,000 after Trump took to his social media platform Truth Social early Thursday to cheer the recent all-time highs, telling crypto enthusiasts that they are welcome for the rally that has followed his election win last month. "CONGRATULATIONS BITCOINERS!!! $100,000!!! YOU'RE WELCOME!!!" Trump wrote. "Together, we will Make America Great Again!" A jobs report that largely matched hopes for a "Goldilocks" reading sent stocks higher in afternoon trading Friday as investors digested a crucial test of the prospects for interest rate cuts in December and beyond. Several Big Tech names also hit intraday highs, including Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), and Meta (META). The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was the outlier among the major indexes, shedding about 0.1%. But the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.2% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) increased roughly 0.6%. A US federal appeals court upheld a new law that outlaws TikTok from operating in the US under Chinese ownership, reports Yahoo Finance's Alexis Keenan. The plan could still be altered by the Supreme Court or affected by President-elect Donald Trump, who in September suggested in a social media post that he would "save TikTok" and prevent federal law enforcement from shuttering the app. The law, called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (PAFACAA), gives TikTok’s Chinese owner, ByteDance, an ultimatum to either sell TikTok to a US owner by Jan. 19, 2025, or have it banned from operations in the country. TikTok challenged the law by arguing it violated the US Constitution in taking away the First Amendment rights of TikTok's US entity and its users. But a panel of three judges from the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit concluded that the government's law withstood constitutional scrutiny by protecting free speech in the US "from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary's ability to gather data on people in the United States." Read about the latest on the government's effort to ban TikTok under Chinese ownership here. A labor market rebound announced Friday is likely to keep the Federal Reserve on track to cut interest rates by another quarter percentage point later this month, absent any upside surprises to inflation, reports Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger. "For the Fed, this doesn't change the narrative," Robert Sockin, Citigroup's senior chief economist, told Yahoo Finance. The new jobs numbers are "right in the spot of what they were looking for and they are comfortable with to continue easing policy" at the last meeting of the year, on Dec. 17-18. Traders boosted the odds of a rate cut at that meeting to 91% following the data release. But Fed watchers agreed that the robust jobs picture and recent stickiness in inflation reinforce a mounting conviction that the pace of rate cuts in 2025 will be less aggressive than once expected. Read about how the latest labor market readings will steer the Federal Reserve's next policy decision here. Consumers are growing more concerned about the path forward for inflation over the next year. The latest consumer sentiment survey from the University of Michigan revealed that consumers expect inflation to hit 2.9% in a year, an increase from last month's expectation of 2.6%. December's reading is the highest in six months but within the 2.3% to 3% range seen in the two years before the pandemic. Expectations for long-run inflation slipped higher, though, falling to 3.1% from 3.2% the month prior. The overall consumer sentiment index popped to a reading of 74, up from 71.8 in November. Overall, consumer views on inflation varied based on political party, Surveys of Consumers Director Joanne Hsu noted. "Democrats voiced concerns that anticipated policy changes, particularly tariff hikes, would lead to a resurgence in inflation," Hsu said in the release. "Republicans disagreed; they expect the next president will usher in an immense slowdown in inflation." Also in this month's data, the survey showed a large increase in buying conditions for durable goods, which boosted current economic conditions by more than 20%. "Rather than a sign of strength, this rise in durables was primarily due to a perception that purchasing durables now would enable buyers to avoid future price increases," Hsu said. A jobs report that largely matched hopes for a "Goldilocks" reading sent stocks higher as investors digested a crucial test of the prospects for interest rate cuts in December and beyond. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained about 0.3% and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.2% after the gauges drifted away from all-time highs at Thursday's close. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) increased roughly 0.3%. The US economy added 227,000 jobs in November, slightly more than expected, as the labor market rebounded from October data that was dinged by severe weather and labor strikes. The unemployment rate unexpectedly ticked up to 4.2%. The US labor market rebounded from an October swoon, adding more jobs than expected in November, while the unemployment rate ticked higher to 4.2%.

Title: Intel’s CEO shakeup puts foundry plans, CHIPS Act cash at risk

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Intel (INTC) is in crisis. The company forced out CEO Pat Gelsinger on Monday, its stock price is down more than 50% on the year, and the grand plan to add third-party semiconductor manufacturing to its repertoire is suddenly more unclear than ever. Gelsinger’s gambit to transform Intel into a US-based version of Taiwan’s TSMC that builds chips for its rivals is one of the reasons the company received $7.8 billion in CHIPS Act funding. But the foundry business, which it plans to operate as an independent subsidiary, has been hemorrhaging money and its biggest customer is still Intel itself. Yes, the company has picked up deals to build chips for Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN), but that hasn’t quelled calls for Intel to kill its third-party foundry plan. Bank of America Global Research analyst Vivek Arya wrote in an investor note that Intel could go as far as fully separating its design and manufacturing businesses. But ditching its fabs, or fabrication facilities, is a lot easier said than done, especially if Intel wants to hold on to those CHIPS Act funds. “They just got the CHIPS Acts money. And if you look very closely at the details, it basically says that Intel cannot sell more than a controlling share of the manufacturing footprint,” explained Mario Morales, group vice president of enabling technologies and semiconductors at IDC. “So that means that Intel will have to maintain manufacturing control of their capacity.” In other words, there’s no easy path forward for the US’s largest homegrown chip builder. The Commerce Department and Intel announced the chipmaker would be getting CHIPS Act funding just last week, with the DoC saying the cash would help Intel expand its manufacturing capacity in the US, a key part of Gelsinger’s plan to help the company compete with TSMC and Samsung, two of the largest chipmakers in the world. Gelsinger initially unveiled the ambitious agenda, called IDM 2.0, or integrated device manufacturing 2.0, in 2021, the same year he took the reins as CEO. At the time, he said Intel would create a world-class foundry business. But Gelsinger took over an Intel beset by problems. Lack of investment and missed opportunities over the years meant the company failed to catch the mobile wave and fell behind TSMC in design capabilities. And building out a global manufacturing footprint isn’t cheap, which, for a company that was already hurting, wasn’t ideal. Gelsinger had four years to make the turnaround happen, and while Intel’s chip design process is catching up, building chip manufacturing facilities takes time, more than Intel’s board seemed interested in giving Gelsinger. “Some of the problems that Intel had, and still has, are not things you can solve overnight. They are multiyear issues,” said TECHnalysis founder and chief analyst Bob O’Donnell. “Gelsinger started on a path to follow some of these things. And I think ultimately, at the highest level, what he chose to do, which is to get the manufacturing stuff back in shape and to work on design, is ultimately what the company needs to do.” Now Intel has to make a decision: carry on with Gelsinger’s plan or cut back and focus on its own chip building capabilities or give up the business entirely. But doing that means saying goodbye to CHIPS Act money unless it can get approval from the Commerce Department Under the terms of the CHIPS Act agreement, Intel is prohibited from certain change of control transactions. If the company spins off its foundry business, it has to hold on to at least 50.1% of the voting rights of the entity if it’s a private company. If the new entity goes public, a third party can’t own 35% or more of it. That means Intel can’t simply cut its foundry business loose and go fabless if it wants to hold on to that CHIPS money. But moving forward with the foundry model could be difficult. “I think as a combined entity it's hard to survive, because the biggest problem is your potential customers for foundry are all your competitors against Intel products,” explained Gartner analyst Gaurav Gupta. “So how would they have trust in Intel foundry and become its customers, right?” If Intel does end up pulling back on its third-party manufacturing ambitions, however, it could end up eating a good portion of the losses. “You'd have to scale back. You'd have to lay off people. I'm sure there would be some sunk cost, but the alternative is you keep losing billions of dollars a quarter,” Citi head of US semiconductor research Chris Danely told Yahoo Finance. “So, I think you just need to scrap it. Take your lumps. If you have to, return the money to the government.” While Danely believes Intel should drop its goal of serving as a global foundry for other companies, he says it should continue to build its own chips. “I still think they should manufacture their own CPUs,” he explained. "There's been speculation for a long time that they're just going to turn the keys over to [TSMC] and have [TSMC] make everything. We don't think that that's the right move.” Before that, however, Intel needs to find a new permanent CEO. Email Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com. Follow him on Twitter at @DanielHowley.

The Dow surged nearly 300 points on Wednesday, driven by gains in Salesforce and other tech stocks. In the afternoon, the Dow climbed 272 points or 0.6%. The S&P 500 added 0.5%, while the Nasdaq rose by 1.1%. Both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq reached fresh record highs, signaling continued optimism in the equity markets. Moreover, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in the afternoon that the Fed can proceed “cautiously” while reducing interest rates. The central bank’s next meeting to discuss rate cuts is scheduled for December 17-18. In economic news, a report from ADP revealed that private payroll growth in November was weaker than expected, highlighting a cooling labor market. U.S. companies added 146,000 jobs during the month, falling short of the downwardly revised 184,000 jobs added in October and missing the estimate of 163,000. The softer labor data has fueled speculation that the Federal Reserve might consider a rate cut to support economic growth. Shares of Salesforce (CRM) reached a new 52-week high today as it posted better-than-expected earnings. The company reported earnings per share (EPS) of $2.41 on an adjusted basis, falling slightly short of the $2.44 analysts had anticipated. However, revenue came in at $9.44 billion, surpassing the $9.34 billion expected. Shares of Marvell Technology (MRVL) and Okta (OKTA) also gained after posting the earnings. However, Chewy (CHWY) lost stock price after releasing the earnings report. Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN) shares both gained nearly 2%. After a brief pause, Bitcoin regained momentum on Wednesday morning as investors shifted their focus to Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). According to Farside, Bitcoin ETFs saw net inflows of $676 million on December 3, highlighting renewed investor interest in the cryptocurrency market.

Title: Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Among Billionaire Ken Fisher’s Top Stock Picks Heading Into 2025

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the Billionaire Ken Fisher's Top 15 Stock Picks Heading Into 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against Ken Fisher's other top stock picks. Ken Fisher is the founder of Fisher Asset Management, a financial adviser that he started nearly five decades ago. The firm oversees over $240 billion from more than 150,000 private investors. Fisher said, "I've gone to cash three times in my career; in 1987 before the crash, before the 1990 bear market and in the early 2000s, before the dot-com crash. But I missed the 2007-2009 bear market because I didn't believe, and don't believe, mortgages could cause what they are blamed for having caused." Besides focusing on long-term investments, Fisher also believes in spreading out investments to reduce risk. Fisher Asset Management is highly diversified, with a portfolio value of about $244 billion. While technology stocks account for 31.8% of the portfolio, the independent money management firm is also heavily invested in the services sector, accounting for 14.6% of the portfolio. Other significant holdings are in the financial services, healthcare, and basic materials sectors. In the past year, Fisher's firm made a 32.18% return, mainly because it invested a lot in tech stocks, especially those benefiting from the AI boom. While other managers are selling tech stocks due to high valuations, Fisher's firm is buying more, especially in companies making AI chips. READ ALSO: 8 Most Undervalued Pot Stocks to Buy According to Analysts and 99% of Billionaire Abrams’ Portfolio is in These 11 Stocks. Even though the overall market is at all-time highs, Fisher says there's no need to worry. He believes that just because the market is high now, it doesn't predict the future. He expects the market to keep going up as long as the economy and other key factors get better. "Bull markets hit new highs on an ongoing basis as soon as they have recovered from the prior bear market and hit their first all-time high in that new bull market. They keep doing that over and over again and eventually you do get another bear market and then again get another bull market. Bull markets, not always, are usually significantly bigger and longer than bear markets, significantly," Ken Fisher said. Ken Fisher's portfolio is heavily invested in the "magnificent seven" stocks, based on the belief that the stocks are well poised to continue outperforming the overall market. According to Fisher, growth stocks will continue outperforming value stocks amid the prevailing economic conditions. "If you think the market is going up, you should expect the magnificent seven to continue to do well. Will they necessarily do better than everything? No, but they never actually did. The fact is they did better as a group than most groups you could find. I think that will continue to be the case because I am optimistic on the market as a whole moving forward", Fisher said in a video interview. Our Methodology We looked through Fisher Asset Management's portfolio to find Ken Fisher's top 15 stock picks for 2025. We focused on his biggest investments and ranked the stocks from smallest to largest based on the firm's stake at the end of Q3 2024. At Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping. Fisher Asset Management’s Equity Stake: $8.32 Billion Number of Hedge Funds Holding Stakes: 286 Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a company that built its name as a retail giant on the sale of consumer products and advertising. It has since diversified its business empire with investments in cloud computing and the sale of electronic devices. About 38% of online sales in the US happen in the company's online store. Consequently, the company is well-positioned to benefit from the growth of e-commerce industry sales. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is succeeding in fending off competition in online sales. The launch of ultra-cheap products through Amazon Haul has strengthened its edge in attracting more sales through the mobile-only marketplace. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) also boasts the largest cloud computing unit. Amazon Web Services is emerging as a key growth and profit driver amid the digital revolution. Grandview Research expects the cloud market to grow by about 21% annually by 2030. Likewise, AMZN should be the biggest beneficiary as it controls 33% market share in the segment. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) also invests in artificial intelligence solutions to enhance its cloud computing solutions. Consequently, AWS sales rose by 19% in the third quarter to $27.5 billion. The increase came as the company rolled out new services, improvements, and solutions for its cloud unit and e-commerce site. Parnassus Core Equity Fund stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q3 2024 investor letter: “Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) ended the quarter slightly down, so our underweight position contributed to relative return. We added the stock after the share price declined significantly, and the timing of the purchase proved beneficial: after we initiated the position, shares rebounded strongly as sentiment around the consumer improved.” Overall AMZN ranks 4th on our list of Ken Fisher's top stock picks heading into 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.
