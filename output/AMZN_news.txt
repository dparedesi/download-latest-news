Title: Ripple’s XRP the Next Amazon? — Analyst Says Long-Term Path to $100 Could Shock XRP Army

Crypto analyst Nick Anderson is drawing parallels between XRP’s price chart and Amazon’s early consolidation. On his BullRunners show, Anderson noted that Amazon’s stock traded roughly flat for about 3,800 days (over 10 years) after 2000, before breaking out in 2010. From roughly $5 then, AMZN went on a 3,900% rally to $200 over the next 15 years. Anderson argues XRP is in a similar sideways phase now. With XRP around $3.02 (near its 2018 peak), XRP is “using its previous high as support,” just as Amazon did before its long run. If history rhymes, he speculates, XRP could eventually repeat Amazon’s surge, potentially heading toward $100–$200 in the distant future. Anderson’s observation hinges on chart patterns. He compared XRP’s multi-year base to Amazon’s pre-boom price action. Amazon’s breakout came after forming a huge cup-and-handle pattern around 2010. Likewise, Anderson sees XRP building a large consolidation now. “XRP has mirrored AMZN’s performance,” he said, noting XRP is “currently in a similar consolidation phase.” In both cases, a prior high became support: Amazon held near $5, and XRP is holding near $2.97. This means the crypto is consolidating around its 2018 all-time high, he points out, before any potential breakout. The headline prediction is ambitious. Anderson suggests XRP could eventually reach $100–$200, mirroring Amazon’s move from $5 to $200. At current prices (about $2.80), that implies a roughly 3,400–6,900% gain. XRP would have to surge by 3,433% and 6,967%” to hit $100 and $200, respectively. Such a move would take years or even decades. Anderson stresses any breakout would be gradual: he projects XRP reaching only $5–$30 in the current market cycle, with the $100+ level not seen until well into the 2030s. Other analysts echo that forecast but add caveats. For example, crypto strategist Paul Barron says a “perfect storm” of catalysts (like ETF approvals and a Ripple banking license) could drive XRP past $50 and even toward $100. He adds that even a sharp pullback after such a move might still leave XRP on a much higher base (potentially a $30–$40 floor). Still, Barron agrees that the timeline is long: a decade or more, not weeks or months. In the near term, Anderson’s targets are far more modest. He argues that in the current cycle, XRP might rally only into the single digits. Specifically, he forecasts a run to about $5 to $30 in this rally phase. Crucially, he warns that a sharp correction would likely follow this. After the current upswing, Anderson expects a major pullback “paving the way for true adoption” later. This echoes common crypto-cycle patterns, where prolonged rallies end in sell-offs before the next big move. Technical analysts observe bullish setups for that mid-cycle rally. Some point to chart patterns that could carry XRP toward $5 and beyond while Bitcoin re-tests key levels. But all agree: such gains are not a straight shot. And as Anderson repeatedly notes, any price spikes to new highs will probably be followed by volatility. In his view, the token’s next upswing will take many years, not just months, to play out. Across the board, analysts stress patience. At $3 today, XRP is still far from its aspirational targets. Anderson’s scenario assumes long-term holds: he even notes that many long-term XRP investors (for example, those in their 30s now) would be middle-aged by the time a $100 price arrives. In other words, wealth from this thesis comes slowly. As one observer put it, the most effective approach is “a long-term strategy of accumulation and patience,” holding through interim pullbacks while waiting for broader adoption. Analyst Zach Rector, a vocal XRP proponent, agrees that volatility is guaranteed. He warns big spikes could quickly reverse – “if XRP goes to 50 bucks, don’t run and tell your wife… that could be cut in half again,” he said.

Title: Watch These Oracle Price Levels as Stock Surges 30% on Boosted Sales Outlook

Oracle (ORCL) shares soared Wednesday morning after the computing giant raised its outlook for cloud infrastructure sales and said it added several large new customers amid booming AI demand. The company, which has struck deals with big tech customers including Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT), said it now sees cloud infrastructure sales jumping 77% to $18 billion this fiscal year, above its June forecast of 70% growth. CEO Safra Catz told investors that the company expects to sign-up several additional multi-billion-dollar customers in coming months to push its booked cloud orders over half a billion dollars. Leading into the company’s earnings release, Oracle shares had gained 45% so far in 2025, handily outpacing the S&P 500’s return over the same period, boosted by robust demand for its cloud infrastructure services and AI database integration tools. The stock was up 32% at $318 in recent premarket trading. Below, we take a closer look at Oracle’s weekly chart and use technical analysis to identify critical price levels that investors will likely be watching. After setting their all-time high in late July, Oracle shares consolidated in a flag pattern ahead of the company’s quarterly results, laying the groundwork for a continuation of the longer-term uptrend. Indeed, the stock looks set to gap to a fresh record high on Wednesday. It’s worth noting that the shares have already registered their highest volume this week since mid July, suggesting that some larger market participants rebalanced portfolios leading into the report. Let’s turn to Oracle’s chart to identify a potential upside target if the shares see an extended post-earnings rally and also point out a few support levels worth monitoring. Investors can project an upside target by using the measured move technique, also known by chart watchers as the measuring principle. When applying the analysis to Oracle’s chart, we calculate the stock’s strong uptrend that preceded the flag in points and add that amount to the pattern’s top trendline. For instance, we add $142 to $242, which projects a target of $384, implying an upside of nearly 60% from Tuesday’s closing price. Future attempts to fill the earnings-driven gap could see the price initially retest the $261 level. This area would likely attract buying interest near the prior record high and top of the flag pattern, which may turn into a critical support region on the chart. Finally, a close below this level opens the door for a more-significant drop to around $198. Investors may look to accumulate Oracle shares at this location near last year’s prominent December swing high, which also closely aligns with a brief pause during the stock’s June rally.
