Microsoft (MSFT+1.61%) stock fell more than 5% in afternoon trading certainty, with Amazon (AMZN+1.51%) and the other Magnificent 7 shares also losing ground as investors continued to reassess the fallout from this week’s abrupt tariff pause — and its likely ripple effects across corporate IT spending. Adding to the pressure, Wedbush Securities cut its 12-month price target for Microsoft stock by almost 14%, from $550 per share to $475. Wedbush warned that economic whiplash and tariff turmoil were putting enterprise tech budgets on ice, especially for big-ticket cloud and AI projects. The influential investment firm maintained its Outperform rating on Microsoft stock but said the “tariff game of poker” unfolding in Washington has already “created real damage to the corporate spending mentality.” Microsoft, with deep exposure to AI and cloud infrastructure, is likely to feel that demand-side chill first. Wedbush analysts described the past week as an “economic Twilight Zone” after President Donald Trump announced sweeping tariffs — then abruptly paused them for 90 days. While the temporary truce offered short-term relief, Wedbush emphasized that “thinking this tariff issue is now done is the wrong view,” arguing that the true impact on enterprise budgets and IT roadmaps will begin to emerge in second-quarter tech earnings. In one of its most pointed warnings, Wedbush called the tariffs “a negotiation tactic for Trump,” but said the gamble could have real and lasting consequences: “The impacts and gamble to the real economy are a snowball that once it starts rolling downhill it cannot be just stopped...and investors will see that front and center during earnings season for tech kicking off in the next few weeks.” Wedbush estimates that 10% to 15% of cloud and AI initiatives across U.S. enterprises could be pushed out amid the current economic uncertainty — potentially dragging down growth in Microsoft’s Azure and AI-linked revenue through the summer. Investors, Wedbush suggested, may need to write off the current quarter as a “mulligan” for Microsoft and other major tech firms. While remaining bullish on Microsoft, Wedbush advised that, “Investors will need to buckle the seat belt and look past the next few quarters of choppiness — and hold the tech winners through the storm.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: Apple, Nvidia, Meta, and more Magnificent 7 stocks slide

The roller-coaster week for global stock markets took another sharp turn Thursday, yanking Nvidia (NVDA+2.93%), Apple (AAPL+4.60%), Amazon (AMZN+1.51%), and other Big Tech stocks down with it. The latest shift erased some of Wednesday’s historic gains, which came as President Donald Trump abruptly announced a 90-day pause on tariff hikes for most countries. After the president’s announcement, Apple stock recorded its best performance in roughly 27 years. However, the pause left out China — which is home to much of Big Tech’s meticulously designed supply chain, including Apple’s. By Thursday, markets seemed reluctant to trust a temporary policy pivot that arrived without warning — even as fresh inflation data offered some welcome relief. Thus, another bad day unfolded for investors. Apple closed the day down 4.2%, while Amazon dropped about 5.2%, Nvidia fell about 5.9%, Meta (META-0.97%) plunged 6.7%, Microsoft (MSFT+1.61%) fell 2.3%, and Tesla (TSLA-0.62%) gave up 7.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq ended Thursday down 4.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 2.5% and the S&P 500 fell about 3.5%. For Tesla, the plunge came as analysts slashed their price targets for the EV stock — over Trump’s impending tariffs on auto parts and weakening demand for Tesla EVs in Europe and China. Meanwhile, Amazon cautioned that tariffs will drive up prices, Apple fell as the Trump administration clarified the latest tariffs on China (145%), and Meta declined as the company attempted to downplay a tell-all book by former Facebook public-policy executive Sarah Wynn-Williams. Other tech losers included Advanced Micro Devices (AMD+5.51%), which tanked about 8.4%, Intel (INTC-3.28%), which took a roughly 7.7% dive, and Palantir (PLTR-1.32%), which fell 3.7%. Hardly any tech-adjacent stock dodged the carnage, but some of the rare exceptions included U.S.-focused telecom stocks, as well as video game maker Electronic Arts (EA+2.34%). —Catherine Baab contributed to this article.

Title: Stock futures slide even as inflation cools. Tesla, Apple, and Amazon slip as bank earnings loom

Stocks closed sharply down on Thursday as investors digested a wave of economic uncertainty, including tariff tensions, inflation data, and a string of downbeat corporate signals. The Nasdaq sank 4.3%, while the S&P 500 dropped 3.5% and the Dow fell 2.5%. The Russell 2000 Index, a benchmark for small-cap stocks, slid 4%. Big Tech led the losses: Apple fell more than 4%, Amazon dropped over 5%, and Tesla slumped more than 7%. Used-car retailer CarMax was one of the day’s biggest losers, closing down 17% after a disappointing earnings report and broader concerns about the auto sector. Looking ahead, Friday will bring a wave of bank earnings, with JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and others set to report — offering fresh insight into credit conditions and consumer resilience. Investors will also parse new economic data, including producer price inflation figures, for clues about the path of interest rates. Markets fell sharply Thursday, giving back a big chunk of Wednesday’s huge rally. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1,693 points in early-afternoon trading, or about 4.2%, after its historic 3,000-point surge the day before, The S&P 500 fell 4.9%, and the Nasdaq dropped 5.7%, with shares of the Magnificent Seven tech giants leading the retreat: Apple (AAPL+4.60%) stock slid 6%, Tesla (TSLA-0.62%) dropped 10%, and Amazon (AMZN+1.51%) fell more than 6.5%. Shopify (SHOP-2.05%) stock tumbled more than 9%. Used car stocks were hit especially hard after CarMax’s earnings miss, with CarMax stock down almost 20% and Carvana (CVNA-1.71%) off 10%. The pullback reflects lingering skepticism around President Donald Trump’s 90-day pause on sweeping tariffs, which arrived even more abruptly than the trade war policy itself. Markets seem reluctant to trust a policy pivot that arrived without warning — even as inflation data offered some welcome relief. The Consumer Price Index showed that core inflation, which excludes food and energy, rose just 0.1% in March, the slowest monthly pace in nine months. Year-over-year, core prices climbed 2.8%, marking the tamest reading since mid-2021. CarMax’s (KMX+2.00%) fiscal fourth-quarter results, also released Thursday morning, revealed mixed performance amid a volatile market environment. The company reported net revenues of $6 billion, a 6.7% increase from the previous year. Earnings per diluted share rose to $0.58, up 81.3% from $0.32 a year ago. However, this fell short of analysts’ expectations of $0.66 per share. Friday will bring a wave of first-quarter results from some of the biggest names in finance, giving investors a deeper look at how the bulge bracket and other banking behemoths are navigating 2025’s economic uncertainty. JPMorgan Chase (JPM+3.58%) will be closely watched for signals on loan growth, credit quality, and net interest margins — the critical metrics that show how it’s managing in a high-rate, low-visibility environment. Any signs of tightening credit or weakening consumer demand could ripple across the market. Wells Fargo’s (WFC-2.13%) numbers will offer a window into consumer lending, where even small shifts in behavior can signal broader household strain. With recession chatter back on the table, analysts are looking for clues about how the bank is adjusting its exposure. Asset manager BlackRock (BLK+2.40%) will report amid surging volatility and massive swings in investor sentiment. Its earnings should reveal whether clients are retreating into cash or leaning into risk — and where the big money is flowing. Morgan Stanley (MS+0.28%) will round out the Friday slate, with attention on investment banking fees and deal activity. With M&A pipelines reportedly thinning and IPOs still scarce, the results could help gauge the depth of Wall Street’s current dealmaking drought.

Title: Trump’s Economic War Against The Communist Chinese Empire Just Went Nuclear
URL: http://theeconomiccollapseblog.com/trumps-economic-war-against-the-communist-chinese-empire-just-went-nuclear/
Time Published: 2025-04-09T21:03:42Z

The Economic Collapse Are You Prepared For The Coming Economic Collapse And The Next Great Depression? Well, isn’t this fun? News that President Trump had decided to pause some of the tariffs that he recently unveiled for 90 days sent stock prices soaring. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up more than 2,900 points on Wednesday, and that is very good news. But not that much has actually changed, and the global trade war is still officially on. In fact, President Trump just hiked the tariff rate on Chinese imports to 125 percent… President Donald Trump on Wednesday said he was authorizing a 90-day pause in reciprocal tariffs to all countries except China, on which he was raising the levy to 125% in the latest twist of a saga that has roiled financial markets for a week. The universal 10% tariffs remain in place. So let’s summarize what just happened. -The universal baseline 10 percent tariffs are still in effect. -The additional reciprocal tariffs that were recently announced have only been delayed for 3 months to allow for negotiations to take place. -The tariff rate on products that we import from China has now been raised to a whopping 125 percent. -Other previously announced tariffs remain in place. As you can see, the reality of what we are facing hasn’t really changed much at all. But headlines that boldly proclaimed that “the tariffs have been paused” sent stock prices screaming higher. The extraordinary rally that we just witnessed really didn’t make much sense at all, but we’ll take it. These days, any victory that we can get is a reason to celebrate. Of course there shouldn’t have been any confusion about what Trump just announced, because what he posted on his Truth Social account was very clear. I have put the most critical parts of his post in bold so that you won’t be able to miss them… Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World’s Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125%, effective immediately. At some point, hopefully in the near future, China will realize that the days of ripping off the U.S.A., and other Countries, is no longer sustainable or acceptable. Conversely, and based on the fact that more than 75 Countries have called Representatives of the United States, including the Departments of Commerce, Treasury, and the USTR, to negotiate a solution to the subjects being discussed relative to Trade, Trade Barriers, Tariffs, Currency Manipulation, and Non Monetary Tariffs, and that these Countries have not, at my strong suggestion, retaliated in any way, shape, or form against the United States, I have authorized a 90 day PAUSE, and a substantially lowered Reciprocal Tariff during this period, of 10%, also effective immediately. Thank you for your attention to this matter! Virtually everybody is still being hit with a 10 percent universal tariff. And our economic war with China has just gone nuclear. The reason why Trump raised the tariff rate on Chinese goods to 125 percent is because the Chinese just dramatically hiked the tariff rate on U.S. imports… China said it is raising its tariffs on U.S. products to 84%, up from its previously announced 34%, after President Trump’s import duties on Chinese good went into effect today at a rate of 104%. In addition to hitting the Chinese with a tariff rate of 125 percent, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is warning that President Trump is also considering removing Chinese companies from our stock exchanges… He also said that all policy options remain open, including the possibility of removing Chinese companies from U.S. stock exchanges. “Everything’s on the table,” before adding that it will be the President Trump who will decide on this matter. Can you imagine what would happen if Trump actually did this and then the Chinese retaliated by doing the same thing to U.S. companies? It would be a bloodbath. Our economy has been so deeply entangled with the Chinese economy for so many years, but now an economic death match between our two nations has begun. If there are products from China that you wish to purchase, I would get them now while you still can. It is being reported that Amazon has already been canceling orders for products that are imported from China… Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) has canceled orders for multiple products made in China and other Asian countries, according to a document reviewed by Bloomberg and people familiar with the matter, suggesting the company is reducing its exposure to tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump. The orders for beach chairs, scooters, air conditioners and other merchandise from multiple Amazon vendors were halted after Trump’s April 2 announcement that he planned to levy tariffs on more than 180 countries and territories, including China, Vietnam and Thailand, the people said. The timing of the cancellations, which had no warning, led the vendors to suspect it was a response to tariffs. In a few months, there will be shortages of certain products that we have become dependent on China to produce for us. In addition, we are being warned to brace ourselves for “significant price shocks”… Americans will be hit by significant price shocks on a huge array of everyday items under sweeping tariffs imposed by President Trump. Clothes, shoes, electronics and cars will be impacted, alongside food, alcohol, and many other essentials. A lot of people are telling me that the short-term pain will be worth it because everything will work out in the end. So let’s see how things play out. President Trump has also announced that new tariffs will be coming on imported pharmaceuticals… US President Donald Trump says he will soon announce “major” tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals, a move that could end decades of low-cost global trade in medicines. For years, most countries, including the US, have imposed few or no tariffs on finished drugs, thanks in part to a 1995 World Trade Organisation (WTO) agreement aimed at keeping medicines affordable. This is going to be interesting. We are very heavily dependent on pharmaceutical production from China. Needless to say, the drug shortages that we have been witnessing in recent years are only going to intensify, and prices are likely to go haywire. Meanwhile, our farmers are going to suffer because the Chinese aren’t going to be buying their output. At this stage, it is being reported that Trump administration officials are considering a new round of bailouts for U.S. farmers… The Trump administration is exploring options to shield American farmers from deepening fallout as its trade conflict with China intensifies, including a possible revival of bailout programs once used during earlier skirmishes with Beijing. According to Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, officials are “looking at that again,” referencing a $28 billion aid package deployed during President Trump’s first term through the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), a government-owned entity designed to support farm incomes and prices. “Obviously everything is on the table, but we’re in such a period of uncertainty in terms of what this looks like,” Rollins told Bloomberg Wednesday at the White House, adding that no final decisions had been made, emphasizing the administration’s hope that aid wouldn’t be necessary. What about the rest of us? Can we get bailouts too? This economic war between the U.S. and China is going to cause pain on both sides of the Pacific. Those that assume that this is going to be a one-sided match simply do not understand how much the Chinese economy has grown in recent years. For example, one Chinese electronics giant is doing things that nobody else in the world is doing… I’d never seen anything like this Huawei campus. Built in just over three years, it consists of 104 individually designed buildings, with manicured lawns, connected by a Disney-like monorail, housing labs for up to 35,000 scientists, engineers and other workers, offering 100 cafes, plus fitness centers and other perks designed to attract the best Chinese and foreign technologists. The Lianqiu Lake R&D campus is basically Huawei’s response to the U.S. attempt to choke it to death beginning in 2019 by restricting the export of U.S. technology, including semiconductors, to Huawei amid national security concerns. The ban inflicted massive losses on Huawei, but with the Chinese government’s help, the company sought to innovate its way around us. As South Korea’s Maeil Business Newspaper reported last year, it’s been doing just that: “Huawei surprised the world by introducing the ‘Mate 60’ series, a smartphone equipped with advanced semiconductors, last year despite U.S. sanctions.” Huawei followed with the world’s first triple-folding smartphone and unveiled its own mobile operating system, Hongmeng (Harmony), to compete with Apple’s and Google’s. President Trump is going to do his best to crush China, and the Chinese are going to do their best to crush us. My concern is that this economic war could ultimately lead to a shooting war. Our relations with China are going downhill really fast, and the Chinese have been engaged in a “staggering” military buildup… NATO must not be ‘naive’ about China in light of Beijing’s ‘staggering’ expansion of its armed forces, the alliance’s chief has warned. Mark Rutte said the country’s substantial investments in its defence capabilities must act as a wake-up call for Western nations who have not taken the threat seriously so far. For years, I have been warning over and over again that the U.S. and China are headed for an inevitable military showdown. Many criticized me for this for a long time, but now we can literally see how we are going to get there. History is being made right in front of our eyes, and the Chinese are pledging to fight this economic war to the end. But if this economic war ultimately evolves into something else, we will all be wishing that we could turn back the clock.

Title: Where Will Amazon Stock Be In 5 Years?

ByCatherine Brock ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. At its current price, the e-commerce giant is a good growth pick for patient and thick-skinned ... More investors. Blink and you could miss the latest trend in Amazon’s stock price. Under an onslaught of conflicting tariff news, investors are wavering between bear and bull outlooks on the e-commerce giant. It's the worst kind of thrill ride, with real money on the line. Wondering how Amazon will fare in Trump's second term and beyond? Here's a look at the factors affecting AMZN stock's growth outlook over the next five years. Spoiler alert: The U.S. tariff policy is a key theme. Amazon has a diversified business model that includes retail sales, cloud computing, digital advertising and streaming entertainment. Amazon.com is the most visited shopping website in the world, accounting for nearly 13% of desktop visits, according to Statista. Statista also reports that Amazon’s cloud offering, AWS, has a leading 30% market share, ahead of Microsoft's Azure and Google Cloud. As well, Amazon Prime Video is atop the U.S. streaming market with a 22% market share, according to Evoca.tv. Amazon stock is up 81% over the past five years, averaging 16.2% annually. Like many tech stocks, the growth trajectory has not been linear. 2022 was a negative year, followed by two growth years in 2023 and 2024. 2025 began strong, but tariff announcements from the U.S. government and the subsequent global economic fallout drove AMZN down about 20% since February 1. Amazon has positive and negative forces in play over the next five years. The company's growing advertising business, e-commerce dominance and AI offerings could drive improved performance. Challenges include the threat of global recession and a looming antitrust lawsuit. Amazon’s advertising business produced $17.3 billion in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2024, 18% more than the prior year period. The annual run rate has doubled in four years, as sellers invest in sponsoring their products on Amazon's e-commerce platform. The company also launched streaming video ads on Amazon Prime last year. With the addition of streaming ads, Amazon can deliver messaging at multiple points within a customer's decision-making process—from brand awareness ads on Prime to conversion ads on Amazon.com. The company also offers robust data analytics so customers can understand how each channel contributes to overall sales. Other e-commerce sellers cannot meaningfully compete against Amazon’s dominance. The company's global scale, reach and brand recognition will deliver a long-lasting stream of shoppers to Amazon's digital properties. This supports ongoing revenue from retail sales, Prime memberships, product ads and, indirectly, Prime video ads. Amazon's ongoing investment in automation and robotics for faster, cheaper order fulfillment should widen its competitive advantage. AWS has grown recently as business customers move to cloud-based computing, in part to take advantage of generative AI technologies. AWS continues to expand its AI toolset to support that transition. The company has also launched the Trainium2 AI chip, which offers "30-40% better price-performance than the current GPU-powered compute instances generally available today,” according to CEO Andy Jassy’s April 10, 2025 annual shareholder letter. and announced development plans for a supercomputer for AI training and computations. The company's investment in AI development tools and hardware will continue as long as demand remains strong. During the company's fourth-quarter earnings webcast, President and CEO Andrew Jassy described AI as "the biggest opportunity since cloud and probably the biggest technology shift and opportunity in business since the internet." Threats of global recession and stagflation in the U.S. are weighing heavily on investors since President Trump announced worldwide tariffs on April 2. A wide-scale economic downturn would hurt Amazon across multiple areas of its business. The good news is that Amazon has managed through a global financial crisis before. AMZN stock dipped more than 40% near the end of 2008 but then reversed those losses by mid-2009. Given its size and financial strength, Amazon will survive an economic downturn better than most. Additionally, the 2025 stock price decline has reduced the valuation and risk. There may be more declines ahead, but it helps that some uncertainty is already priced in. In 2023, the FTC under the Biden administration sued Amazon for illegal actions to stifle competition. The trial had been slated to begin in September, but the FTC recently asked a judge for a delay due to resource constraints. Experts disagree on Trump's potential handling of this case. On the one hand, Trump may push the FTC to drop the charges because they were initiated under his predecessor. On the other hand, Trump has not backed down from other antitrust cases against big tech. Amazon retains an average strong buy recommendation from analysts, according to Stockanalysis.com. There are 25 strong buys, 19 buys and one hold. The consensus price target is $260.89, 40% higher than AMZN’s current price. This includes price target reductions initiated since the April 2 tariff announcement by analysts at Mizuho, Bank of America Securities, and JP Morgan. The cuts ranged from 10% to 18%. Investors, too, believe the high U.S. tariffs undermine Amazon's growth outlook. AMZN stock is down about 14% for the year, a decline prompted by Trump's initial tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China announced in February. After the more extensive April 2 tariff announcement, AMZN's price dipped about 9%. Those losses quickly reversed once Trump paused tariffs for many countries except China on February 9. The bullish scenario for Amazon involves quick stabilization of the global economy. In a normal economic environment, Amazon should be able to grow earnings roughly 20% annually over the next five years. Applying that growth to the company’s current P/E ratio of 34 implies a five-year price target in the high-$400s. That's more than double AMZN's current price. Amazon's current P/E ratio is well below the company's historic average, so this may be a conservative bull view. If the world economy stagnates, the future looks different for Amazon and its shareholders. The 20% annual earnings gains will not materialize, at least until economic conditions stabilize. Worse, investors will be reactive until the crisis ends. Any earnings miss or signs of slowness could prompt selloffs. There will be more volatility in Amazon's stock price than in its business results. Price swings will be the defining trend for the foreseeable future. Amazon’s current price point will prove to be a super buying opportunity—but whether that happens in three, five or 10 years is uncertain. The timeline depends on the economic fallout from Trump's ever-changing tariff policy. Assuming the tariff crisis passes, Amazon’s five-year outlook is strong. The company can deliver double-digit earnings increases annually, thanks to its dominance across e-commerce, cloud computing and streaming entertainment. Investors who can hold on through the volatility could see their AMZN positions double in value, or better. Bottom Line Amazon is a good long-term investment, but economic conditions may delay the rewards beyond five years. At its current price, the e-commerce giant is a good growth pick for patient and thick-skinned investors. If that doesn't describe you, look for more investing ideas in this list of best stocks for 2025. Amazon’s stock price could double or better in five years, assuming a global trade war and related economic fallout doesn't undermine the company's growth prospects. Amazon is a good long-term investment. The company has leading market share in three industries, including cloud computing where AI is driving demand. Global economic uncertainty is Amazon's biggest risk. A downturn that impacts consumer and business spending patterns would limit Amazon's growth prospects across multiple divisions.
