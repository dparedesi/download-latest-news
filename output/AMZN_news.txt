Amazon Web Services (AWS) went down on October 20, 2025, hitting its US-EAST-1 region hard. Millions of users lost access to platforms like Snapchat, Robinhood, Fortnite, Roblox, and Amazon.com services. Downdetector logged over 20,000 outage reports in hours. Despite the massive disruption, Amazon stock closed at $213.04, down just 0.68%, with pre-market trading at $212.27. Analysts say the outage underscores risks in cloud dependency but doesn’t immediately threaten Amazon’s stock. Investors remain cautiously optimistic ahead of the earnings report.
