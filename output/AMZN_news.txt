(Photo by Chesnot/Getty Images) After a jubilant runup to all-time highs, Microsoft (MSFT) shares are taking a pause subsequent to a protracted period of AI optimism for big techs. The tech giant’s elevated levels of AI capital spending that have yet to translate into tangible returns appear to be causing some unease among investors. Exacerbating the concerns, growth in Microsoft’s much-hailed Azure cloud services during the recent fourth quarter was perceived as weaker than expected. The beginning of a Fed rate easing cycle is also motivating investors to look beyond the overheated valuations of mega techs. Microsoft recently announced a 10% increase in its quarterly dividend alongside a mammoth share buyback program of up to $60 billion. Is the Microsoft stock a buy in view of its dividend hike and stock buyback plans? Where is the Microsoft stock headed? Is a $4 trillion valuation in the cards for the MSFT stock? After touching a 52-week intra-day high of $468.35 on July 5, the stock receded and closed at a low of $394.44 on August 5 following its fourth-quarter earnings release on July 30. Although MSFT reported better-than-expected earnings and revenues for the fourth quarter, the market chose to focus on the shortfall in its Azure cloud revenues. Azure is a key area of focus for analysts, as it competes with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud. Microsoft is going head-to-head with the other two for capturing new business. The investments towards Azure AI growth, drive a significant portion of the capex spend for MSFT. So, it’s good to know that AI services contributed 8 percentage points, accounting for more than a fifth of the growth in “Azure and other cloud services” revenue during the fourth quarter. In response to an analyst’s query in the fourth-quarter earnings conference call, Microsoft attributed capacity constraints for impacting Azure growth, noting that AI demand remained higher than available capacity. These capacity restrictions alongside softness in non-AI consumption in some European geographies are expected to continue into the first half of fiscal 2025. However, Azure growth is expected to accelerate in the second half of fiscal 2025, as capital investments should increase available AI capacity to serve the growing demand.

In July, Microsoft noted that its revenue from Azure and other cloud services grew 29% year over year during the fourth quarter. (Typically, Microsoft does not disclose the dollar value of revenue for this category.) The growth was 30% in constant currency (assuming constant exchange rates) in line with Microsoft’s guidance for 30% to 31% growth, but fell short of the 31% growth pegged by analysts. It caught the market off-guard as Azure growth numbers have never missed estimates since 2022. The lack of visibility into cloud consumption trends also poses a problem. The Azure consumption business (in which businesses only pay for the resources and services consumed), which includes AI, has historically grown faster than the per user business. However, Microsoft typically features the slower-growing per-user pieces in the Azure and other cloud services’ revenue stream, complicating the visibility into the consumption of Azure. However, in August, Microsoft updated its reporting structure to enhance visibility into its cloud consumption revenue and the benefits of AI for the overall business. Under the new reporting framework, the slower growing per-user revenue streams such as the Power BI data analytics tool and the Enterprise Mobility and Security (EMS) product suite will be excluded from the closely monitored Azure and other cloud services metric. With the relocation of these two components, the new Azure number is expected to now align more closely to the consumption business. However, Microsoft will be adding revenue from its search and news advertising category into Azure and other cloud services. So, the updated Azure and other cloud services revenue growth metric will include revenue from Azure and other cloud services, including cloud and AI-consumption based services, GitHub cloud services, Nuance Healthcare cloud services, virtual desktop offerings and other cloud services. Subsequent to the reclassification, Microsoft restated its investor metrics, including Azure and other cloud services revenue growth and updated its first-quarter guidance. Based on the restatement, revenue from Azure and other cloud services for the fourth quarter grew 34% to 35% in constant currency (vs. 29% to 30% growth in constant currency reported in July). For the first quarter, revenue growth for the new Azure and other cloud services is expected to be 33% in constant currency (vs. prior projections for growth of 28% to 29% in constant currency in July). Based on the takeaways from the July earnings call, there appears to be no slowdown in demand for Azure consumption. The quote from Microsoft’s CFO Amy Hood, “Azure consumption business continues to grow faster than total Azure.” has a nice reassuring ring to it. With the reorganization in reporting structure, the upcoming first quarter earnings print will likely offer more helpful context on how Azure is shaping up for the second quarter and future periods. Microsoft’s intelligent digital assistants called Copilot streamline workflows. Copilot can help draft emails and reports, summarize documents, provide data insights, create presentations, generate software code and automate repetitive tasks. About 60% of Fortune 500 companies have adopted Copilots. Copilot is used in GitHub (which is a code-sharing platform) for providing AI assistance in software coding. More than 77,000 organizations have adopted GitHub Copilot, and the number is up 180% year over year. The use of Copilot has pushed GitHub’s annual revenue run rate to $2 billion and accounted for 40% of GitHub’s revenue growth in fiscal 2024. Copilot for Microsoft 365 is gaining solid traction; customers grew more than 60% quarter-over-quarter, while the number of people who used Copilot daily at work doubled. The number of customers with more than 10,000 seats more than doubled quarter over quarter, including Capital Group, Disney, Dow, Kyndryl, Novartis and EY, which alone is expected to deploy Copilot to 150,000 of its employees. Copilot is still in the nascent stages of growth, but already showing great promise as a future driver of recurring revenue growth for MSFT. With the rollout of additional features and functionality, Copilot is expected to deliver even greater value. The Copilot add-on for Microsoft 365 plan costs $30 per user per month, while a basic business subscription for Microsoft 365 costs $6 per user per month, a standard business subscription costs $12.50 and a premium business subscription costs $22.50.

During its fourth-quarter earnings call, Microsoft addressed the elephant in the room–the raging industry debate about the monetization of its significant investments in generative AI. Capital expenditures, including finance leases, totaled $55.7 billion for fiscal 2024 (including $11.2 billion in first-quarter 2024, $11.5 billion in second-quarter 2024, $14 billion in third-quarter 2024 and $19 billion in fourth-quarter-2024) up 75% year over year. A bulk of the capex spend is towards cloud and AI-related investments. Microsoft said that nearly 50% of its capex went towards infrastructure needs, like the land and data center buildout, while the rest was decided by “demand signals.” CPUs or GPus will be bought only based on these demand signals. Azure AI growth, and recurring customers for Microsoft 365 Copilot are some of the demand signals that decide the trajectory of more than 50% of Microsoft’s capital spending toward cloud and AI-related investments. While responding to an analyst’s question, Microsoft said it could see consistent revenue growth even without this sort of elevated capital expense because of the variable nature of the capex. In what could be viewed as an elaboration on the demand signals, Microsoft said it witnessed record commitments to its Microsoft Cloud platform in the fourth quarter and commercial bookings were significantly ahead of expectations rising 17% (and 19% in constant currency) year over year, thanks to growth in the number of $10 million-plus and $100 million-plus contracts for both Azure and Microsoft 365. Microsoft has more than 60,000 Azure AI customers, up nearly 60% year over year with the average spend per customer continuing to grow. Microsoft said that the expansion of its data center footprint targeting investments across four continents aimed to create long-term assets globally to drive growth for the next decade and beyond. Fiscal 2025 capex is expected to be higher vs. fiscal 2024, and tied to demand signals and adoption of its AI-based services. MSFT plans to be more disciplined to keep its opex growth in the single digit for fiscal 2025 to somewhat compensate for the higher capex. Besides, cash flow from operations surpassed $100 billion for the first time, reaching $119 billion for fiscal 2024, resulting in an attractive free cash flow (FCF) generation of approximately $74 billion, even after the escalated spending. Strong FCF generation characteristics render solid support for Microsoft’s capital spending plans. MSFT appears to have adequately addressed the concerns regarding its capex boost for fiscal 2025. It is now up to investors to take a deep, long look and decide if they are comfortable with the answers. Xbox content and services revenue increased 61% during the fourth quarter, of which 58 points were attributed to Activision. The acquisition of Activision has given Microsoft a strong content pipeline and a foothold in mobile gaming, a turf where it virtually had no presence before. In gaming, Microsoft now has more than 500 million monthly active users, across devices and platforms. Microsoft’s official cloud gaming service, Xbox Cloud Gaming, allows a user to play native console games in the cloud and stream it to a phone, PC, or console. The game catalog for Xbox Cloud Gaming has more than 200 titles including a number of EA Play games that make it quite appealing for users. Xbox Cloud Gaming is only available for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers, a service that costs $19.99 a month. For the first quarter, Xbox content and services revenue is expected to grow in the low to mid-50s percentage. Gaming could likely turn out to be a good revenue avenue, amid the projected growth in the global cloud gaming market from an estimated $5.8 billion in 2023 to $9.7 billion in 2024, thanks to the rise in mobile cloud gaming, according to Fortune Business Insights. Microsoft has made partnerships the cornerstone of its growth strategy. To understand the economic value partners realize through their collaboration with Microsoft and its technology—particularly with AI, IDC conducted a global study (commissioned by Microsoft). A key finding of this web-based global survey of 638 Microsoft partners was the “partner multiplier” metric. For every $1 of Microsoft revenue, Microsoft partners who provide services generate $8.45 and partners who develop software generate $10.93. This compelling number could spur further partner-led growth for MSFT. In its fourth-quarter earnings call, Microsoft noted that it “continues to prioritize security above all else.” It has more than 1.2 million security customers. “Defender for Cloud”—MSFT’s cloud security solutions for protecting customer workloads across multi-cloud and hybrid environments surpassed $1 billion in revenue for the past year (as of July 31, 2024). It is interesting that Nadella should reinforce MSFT’s commitment to prioritize security above all else. On July 18, cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike released a flawed software update, crashing millions of Windows devices. Microsoft pegged this estimate to 8.5 million Windows devices representing around 1% of all Windows machines. However, many of these customers were providers of critical services, like airlines and Banks. Although the outage was caused by the CrowdStrike update, Microsoft may likely face some pushback about the perceived chinks in its operating system. Of course, other risks include Microsoft not meeting its AI objectives and the subsequent repercussions that could stem from it. Cloud revenues and operating income for the latest June quarter: New data from Synergy Research Group, which tracks IT and cloud data, shows that second-quarter enterprise spending on cloud infrastructure services totaled $79 billion globally, up 22% year over year. Amazon remained the market leader during the June quarter with a 32% market share, followed by Microsoft at 23% and Google at 12%. Microsoft’s lead in generative AI and large language models (LLMs) is narrowing. Microsoft had a head-start advantage in the space through its investment in OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT. However, Amazon’s investment in Anthropic (the creator of Claude LLMs) and Google’s introduction of its Gemini model are leveling the playing field. Although ChatGPT remains the most popular chat-bot currently, experts opine that the offerings from Anthropic and Google have demonstrated superior performance vs. ChatGPT on various benchmarks. While Amazon and Google are playing catchup with ChatGPT, MSFT is adding its own in-house data center-bound AI chips, the Azure Maia 100 AI Accelerator for training and running AI models, and the Azure Cobalt 100 CPU, which is optimized for general purpose workloads. As of now, MSFT accounts for nearly 20% of Nvidia’s revenues, while Google and Amazon represent about 5% each. With its own AI chips, MSFT has the potential to close the much-touted cost advantage with AMZN and GOOG. In mid-September, MSFT announced a new $60 billion stock buyback program, aligning with its largest repurchase authorization to date. The new buyback authorization, which represents nearly 2% of MSFT’s market cap of $3.1 trillion, has no expiration date and replaces a $60 billion buyback program announced in 2021. Shareholder return initiatives are not new for Microsoft, which returned more than $34 billion to shareholders via dividends and buybacks in fiscal 2024. The company has repurchased shares consistently over the last two decades. However, the new buyback authorization does signal that the tech giant remains committed to robust free cash flow generation, despite its elevated AI-driven investments. Atop the battle for AI dominance, the top tech majors are also actively competing on buyback and dividend programs, which bodes well for shareholders. In May, Apple announced the biggest-ever $110 billion stock buyback authorization, following Google parent Alphabet’s $70 billion buyback authorization announcement in April. Microsoft ranks third so far this year in terms of buyback size. In February, Meta authorized an additional $50 billion in share repurchases, which represented 5% of its $1 trillion market cap at the time. Meta’s market cap has since grown by 50% to $1.5 trillion. Microsoft increased its quarterly dividend payout by 10% or 8 cents to $0.83 per share from the present $0.75 per share and made the announcement in mid-September along with the buyback plans. The dividend is payable to shareholders on December 12. MSFT stock goes ex-dividend– the cutoff date for new buyers of the stock to be eligible for the upcoming dividend–on November 21. At current stock prices, the new dividend has a forward yield of nearly 0.8%. Here’s a fun fact. Every year, the new quarterly dividend increase tops the year-ago dividend increase by a penny–a pattern that can be observed since November 2021. For example, the upcoming new dividend is $0.83 per share, a 8-cent increase from $0.75 per share in 2023, which is a 7-cent increase from $0.68 in 2022, and this represents a 6-cent increase from $0.62 in 2021. Microsoft has paid and grown its dividend for two decades now. This compares very favorably with the sector’s ten consecutive years of dividend payment and one year of dividend growth. Considering that Microsoft has consistently paid and increased dividends, there isn’t much in the way of surprises that would significantly impact MSFT stock behavior—unless Microsoft were to halt or cut its dividend payments. Such a move could serve as a notable negative catalyst, though the probability of that occurring is extremely low. Currently, Microsoft distributes more than 25% of its annual earnings as dividends, which seems safe and sustainable for now. Earnings reports, company developments and competitive dynamics have a stronger sway on MSFT’s stock price. Amid the pressure to show payoffs on their huge AI capital spending, other mega techs are turning more shareholder friendly. In February, Meta joined the throngs of Apple and Microsoft, by initiating its first-ever dividend of 50 cents per share, which would be paid on a quarterly basis. After the dividend announcement on February 1, META stock closed 20% higher on February 2. Google parent Alphabet initiated a cash dividend of 20 cents per share in April and the stock gained 10% the next day. Amazon is the only major tech that does not offer a dividend yet. Wall Street analysts are overwhelmingly bullish on the MSFT stock with an average price target of $496, which represents roughly an 18% upside from current stock price levels of around $420. MSFT stock has no Sell ratings and a few Hold ratings. Goldman Sachs (GS) maintains a Buy rating but reduced the price target on Microsoft to $500 from $515. GS expects 14% revenue growth for the first quarter, inline with the consensus, and sees EPS of $3.14, slightly above the consensus. Oppenheimer downgrades Microsoft to “Perform” From “Outperform,” citing higher-than-expected losses from Microsoft’s OpenAI investment and slower enterprise adoption of AI technology. Analysts at D.A. Davidson downgraded the stock to “Neutral” from “Buy,” keeping the price target unchanged at $475, citing concerns over the narrowing AI lead of Microsoft vs. rivals Google and Amazon, and MSFT’s heavy reliance on Nvidia for AI infrastructure. Jefferies is keeping its Buy rating, and price target unchanged at $550, citing the strong performance of Azure, and the promising trajectory of the M365 Copilot initiative. MSFT is 10% off its 52-week intraday high reached on July 5. After more than doubling in value over the past two years, a 10% correction in the MSFT stock is not exactly devastating. It could also be an opportunity to buy into a quality, futuristic business with the stock headed for new heights. In the near-term, there’s a very high likelihood of the Microsoft stock revisiting its highs, given an upcoming key catalyst, Microsoft’s first-quarter earnings report scheduled for release on October 30. In the longer run, AI is here to stay and is not going anywhere in a hurry. By building an evolving AI ecosystem around its products, MSFT is positioning itself as a major force within AI and cloud services. The market is in the “show me the money” mode. However, investors should remember that data centers cannot be built in a day and scaling up is a herculean task. Microsoft is definitely making progress and AI investments are already generating additional business for Microsoft, as can be seen by the strong signups for Azure AI and Microsoft 365 Copilot. Analysts expect $140 billion in incremental revenue from AI services for MSFT by 2027. Adding this to the fiscal 2024 revenue of $245 billion, Microsoft has the potential to reach a $4 trillion valuation by 2027 based on its five-year average price-to-sales ratio of 10.6x, representing 30% upside from current levels. Not to forget the long-term dividends and share buybacks that could further unlock value for investors. Microsoft stock is the top holding of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust. The Trust owns roughly $14.7 billion worth of Microsoft stock, representing about 30% of its $48 billion portfolio. Microsoft has been growing dividends and implementing buybacks over the last two decades. So, the recent buyback/dividend announcement is not expected to have much sway on the stock price. If the stock rallies, it could be attributed to the upcoming first-quarter earnings report slated for release on October 30. It appears that Microsoft has adequately addressed the concerns related to its capital spending in its fourth-quarter earnings call, expounding on the growing demand signals for Azure and Microsoft 365 Copilots and the variable, demand-driven nature of capex. Strong FCF generation characteristics render support to its capital spending plans. The revamp to its reporting structure will likely enhance visibility into its cloud consumption revenue and the benefits of AI on the overall business and ease any investor apprehensions. With growth in Xbox Content and Services revenue, gaming will likely shape up to a decent revenue stream as the global cloud gaming market gathers pace. Microsoft has the potential to reach a $4 trillion valuation by 2027, if all goes as planned.

Atypical of technology stocks, Microsoft has paid and grown its dividend for two decades. This compares favorably with the sector’s 10 consecutive years of dividend payment and one year of dividend growth. Microsoft has repurchased shares actively over the last two decades. In mid-September, MSFT announced a new $60 billion stock buyback program, aligning with its largest repurchase authorization to date. Stock buybacks reduce the number of shares outstanding and offset any dilutive impact for existing shareholders from a past stock offering or stock option exercise. Buyback announcements tend to push up the stock price but not always. Have any buybacks gone wrong?Pharma giant Merck’s shares lost 15% in the month, subsequent to the unveiling of its huge $10 billion buyback program on February 22, 2000. The selloff was because investors believed that the $10 billion could have been put to better use to bolster Merck’s drug pipeline that was running dry. Microsoft pays a dividend with a forward yield of 0.8%. The yield may look small, but that is because of the strong rally in the MSFT stock over the past years. Typically, investors buy the MSFT stock for its capital appreciation potential with lesser emphasis placed on the dividend.

Title: Mag 7 Become Drag 7, Taking Down QQQ & Create Opening For “Q Killers”

Lately, the Mag 7 Have Become the Drag 7 The Magnificent Seven, led by Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Meta, and Tesla helped major indices soar to new heights over the past decade. Since early February 2016, the S&P 500 has appreciated 265% while the QQQs nearly doubled that performance at 450%. Chief among the QQQ’s rise has been the tech heavy members of the Magnificent Seven (aka Mag 7). Each of the Mag 7 generated peak returns, that were in some cases, well above the 450% QQQ average. Standouts such as Nvidia (+21,280%), Tesla (+4000% peak return) and mega cap heavyweights, Apple (787% peak return), Microsoft (972% peak return) and Amazon (727% peak return) helped drive the exceptional performance. While the Mag 7 reached record levels, investors cheered. Who would publicly criticize a fund or index that produced exceptional results irrespective of disproportionate weights in only a handful of stocks? But what happens when these same 7 overweight stocks start to falter? Nothing good. The same Newtonian principles that drove stock prices and indexes higher, apply the same magic in reverse. Whatever goes up can come down. Seemingly overnight, the Mag 7 have become the Drag 7. Much of the appreciation occurs due to Market Cap weighted passive indices that do not easily change the mix of stocks or assigned weights. Consequently, as money flows into various funds, the index constituents are purchased automatically. This pushes the prices and market capitalizations of the stocks, and corresponding indices, higher. This is true irrespective of perceived valuation or price. There is no check or intervention as prices rise. And as more money flows in, the pace of appreciation and momentum rise even faster due to greater weight that the constituents hold. Passive indices hold to their prescribed rules and buy or sell in a pro rata fashion as dollars flow in or out. Although there are some benefits of a passive index, principally competitive, low fees and trading costs, there is an inherent flaw. There is generally no valuation overlay. And just as a few heavily weighted stocks can push an index higher as the prices go higher, the same will happen as heavily weighted stocks fall. This is what is happening now. Heavily weighted Mag 7 stocks are falling, due to active investors selling the stocks, and dragging major passive indices down. The cracks in the impenetrable Mag 7 base begin to appear around July 8, 2024. Since, that time period most of the Mag 7 have fallen. Though market dynamics can change at any time, this should be a concern for many investors in the future. The history of the Mag 7 began many years ago. For a long time the market leaders were referred to as the “FAANGs”. This acronym corresponded with: Facebook (before it became “Meta”), Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google. Notable among the missing constituents were Microsoft and Nvidia. This was before Nvidia was recognized as an AI leader. At the time, investors were bullish on Netflix as a Covid stock darling. After Covid, Netflix fell and the moniker “FAANGs” was replaced with the broader grouping of “Mag 7”. Microsoft and Nvidia were added and Netflix disappeared. The Mag 7 proved to be a more powerful mix than the FAANGS. Investors enjoyed a strong bull market rally, and with each year, as more money flowed to passive ETFs, a disproportionate percentage of the funds went back into the Mag 7. Their market capitalizations swelled. Several companies reached $1 trillion market capitalization (META) then quickly became $2 trillion companies (AMZN and GOOGL) and then even faster to $3 trillion market cap valuations (MSFT, AAPL, NVDA). Never before had massive companies reached $1 trillion levels, let alone $2 trillion and $3 trillion. Moreover, the moves beyond $1 trillion moved with unprecedented speed. Money flowed into index funds, which pushed stock prices higher, that continued to replenish a buying cycle that added more buying pressure, which in turn, increased the stock weights of the Mag 7. Today, only a handful of stocks represent a disproportionate percentage of the weight in indexes with 100 or even 1000 companies. This is dangerous for investors and it violates the basic underlying investment principle of diversification by not putting too many eggs in one basket. By way of example, only 3 stocks (AAPL, MSFT and NVDA) now comprise 35% of the Russell 1000 Growth index. This is far too heavy and can create major problems for investors when these three stocks drop. Moreover, more than 1/2 or approximately 54% of the Russell 1000 Index now resides in the Mag 7. Concentration can be a terrific thing when the Mag 7 are rising. For example, in 2023 the Russell 1000 Growth Index generated a return of 42.60% and the Mag 7 contributed 62% of the total performance. It was even more concentrated for the Invesco QQQ which generated a return of 54.85% with 68% of the performance originating from the Mag 7. However, the table below shows what can happen when the heavy concentration in the Mag 7 starts to falter. While the concentration is terrific when the stocks rise, it can be devastating when those stocks start to decline. This is the interesting characteristic that is happening to the Magnificent Seven lately. Some of the constituents are dropping and, more importantly, rather than creating wealth for investors, at least 5 of the 7 members, are starting to lose wealth. The table below illustrates. Magnificent 7 Performance Since July 8, 2024 to Oct 11, 2024 Since July 8, 2024 through October 11, 2024, five of the Mag 7 have fallen and the Tech heavy QQQ index has been negative (-0.66%). The worst performer since July 8, is TSLA (-13.89%), followed by GOOGL (-13.53%), MSFT (-10.55%), AMZN (-5.25%) and AAPL. This has far reaching ramifications for asset allocation among portfolio managers who currently invest in large capitalization, growth-oriented baskets. Despite holding hundreds of stocks in their funds, the preponderance of the equity weights reside among only a handful of securities. Perhaps, equally important, due to the heavy concentrations of just a few securities in an index, pension consultants and other fiduciaries, whose job it is to advise clients, may find that they may soon experience legal exposure by not better diversifying their clients’ portfolios. The Table below shows the performance of the QQQ relative to another Index with a similar correlation to Technology stocks, the Entrepreneur 30 Total Return Index (ER30TR). The ER30TR Index does not hold 4 (AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, TSLA) of the Mag 7 and is underweight 2 others (GOOGL, NVDA). In this particular case, the returns for the period July 8, 2024 through October 11, 2024 were a positive 6.7% for the ER30TR while negative 0.66% for the QQQ. (Note: past performance is no guide or guarantee of future performance). QQQ's Are Negative Since 07/08/2024 to Present (10/11/2024) The returns year to date (YTD) have shown similar results. While the QQQ have generated a solid 20.99% YTD, they fall below the 23.24% SPX (S&P 500) and pale next to the 41.63% for the Entrepreneur 30 (ER30TR). (Note: past performance is no guide or guarantee of future performance). Major Stock Indexes YTD (through Oct. 11, 2024) Moreover, in the context of longer periods, it is clear that the Invesco QQQ have prospered since January 2023. In the time period January 1, 2023 through October 11, 2024, the Invesco QQQ generated an impressive 87.25% return with exactly 2/3 of the return coming from the Mag 7. This is well above the SPX return of 55.22% and far above the 33.80% return for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. However, the performance could have been much better. As the table illustrates below, the Entrepreneur 30 Total Return Index provided a return of 122.22% during the same time period with a little over 1/3 of its total return coming from the Mag 7. Moreover, the Entrepreneur 30 TR Index had only 21% of its weight coming from the Mag 7 whereas the Mag 7 represent approximately 46% of the Invesco QQQ. In other words, despite the strong performance of the Mag 7, the Entrepreneur 30 TR Index provided 1.4X the return of the QQQ (122% vs 87%) with less than 1/2 the weight of the Mag 7 (compared to the QQQ) and less than 1/2 the performance coming from the Mag 7 (compared to the QQQ). (Note: past performance is no guide or guarantee of future performance). Major Index Performances Since 12/31/2022 Is it fair to compare an index with 30 holdings with an index that has 100 holdings? If the holdings were equal weighted, then the answer would be “no”. However, in the case of the Entrepreneur 30TR (ER30TR), the weights in the Mag 7 were only 21% vs 46% for the Invesco QQQ. This means that despite having more constituents in the Invesco QQQ, the weights in the Mag 7 were much more concentrated. Moreover, 2/3 of the total returns in the QQQ were from the Mag 7, whereas only 1/3 of the returns for the ER30TR were from the Mag 7. This means that it is possible to have fewer stocks in an Index, yet have less concentration and greater returns. As a result, many investors are now beginning to seek alternatives to the concentrated nature of the QQQ and Russell 1000 Growth. Could the ER30TR be the new replacement?(Note: past performance is no guarantee or guide to future returns). Overall returns, led by the Mag 7, have generated extraordinary returns for Tech heavy indices over the past few years. But concentration to just a handful of securities becomes dangerous when the heavily-weighted holdings begin to drop. Several popular indices, such as the Russell 1000 Growth and Invesco QQQ have seen their assets under management (AUM) ascend to hundreds of billions of dollars during the past few years. The Russell 1000 Growth is now approaching $100 Billion and the Invesco QQQ are nearing $300 Billion. With each index holding approximately 1/2 its weight in the Mag 7, this implies that 2 indices, control nearly $200 Billion of the Mag 7. Many other funds and indices, as well as private funds, pension funds, SMAs (separately managed accounts) control similar weights. This concentration can be devastating to investors as the Mag 7 decline. Investors are now seeking alternatives and discovering that it may be possible to achieve higher returns with less concentration—at least for certain periods of time. The QQQ have had an extraordinary growth record in raising AUM. If the concentrated Mag 7 continue to falter, replacement indices may soon become prevalent. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Please refer to the below disclosures: https://lnkd.in/e29X6rN

Upgrade today! What happened? On Monday, Wells Fargo downgraded Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) to Equalweight with a $183 price target. *TLDR: WFC sees NT pressures on AMZN from Project Kuiper and FBA fee issues. AMZN’s margin expansion faces competition from Walmart (NYSE:WMT), reducing FBA fees by $2 billion. What’s the full story? Wells Fargo analysts note that while Amazon has been a consistent positive revision story, several factors are likely to pressure revisions in the near term. These include investments in Project Kuiper, anticipated FBA fee pressures, and moderating advertising operating income contributions. The bank’s downgrade comes on the heels of potential caps on margin expansion in the first half of 2025. Consequently, Wells Fargo has reduced its operating income estimates for 2025, 2026, and 2027 by $5.4 billion, $4.5 billion, and $5.5 billion, respectively. Despite these headwinds, Wells Fargo maintains that Amazon remains a margin expansion story, albeit at a more moderate pace than the market expects. The analysts also highlight the growing competition from Walmart, whose expanding fulfillment capabilities and competitive pricing are likely to impact Amazon’s merchant services more than consumer wallet share. This competition is expected to result in an estimated $2 billion annual reduction in FBA fees. Equalweight at Wells Fargo means “Total return on stock expected to be -10% to +10% over the next 12 months. “ What happened? On Tuesday, Wolfe Research upgraded Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) to Outperform with a $65 price target. *TLDR: Wolfe upgraded WFC amid a challenging ~9% EPS reset for 2026. Asset cap removal expected to boost EPS, supporting the upgrade decision. What’s the full story? Wolfe upgraded Wells Fargo amid the challenging ~9% EPS reset for 2026 and the complexities of AML and regulatory risks. The decision comes after noting that WFC shares have significantly lagged behind peers by approximately 2000 basis points since April. The analysts believe that the risks to consensus EPS and Net Interest Income (NII) are now better understood, and the current valuation remains overly discounted, even with deeper cuts. Furthermore, Wolfe highlights that the removal of the asset cap is expected to provide a high-single-digit EPS boost, which is not yet reflected in the stock’s multiple. This potential tailwind, combined with the improved understanding of risks, supports the analysts’ decision to upgrade WFC. Outperform at Wolfe means “The security is projected to outperform analyst's industry coverage universe over the next 12 months.” What happened? On Wednesday, Citi upgraded Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd (NYSE:NCLH) to Buy with a $30 price target. *TLDR: Citi sees NCLH’s new strategy balancing yield and cost, mitigating runaway expenses. Potential 30% EPS CAGR if NCLH maintains a 2.5% yield/cost spread. What’s the full story? Citi analysts express confidence in Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings’ new strategy, which aims to balance yield and cost, mitigating the risk of runaway expenses. They estimate a 23% three-year EPS CAGR, potentially reaching 30% if NCLH maintains its targeted 2.5% yield/cost spread. This shift from a “quality at all costs” approach to a more balanced strategy is expected to unlock significant pricing opportunities without escalating costs. The firm’s conservative long-term estimates suggest substantial earnings upside, even if NCLH falls short of its yield/cost target. Citi’s projections indicate that maintaining the 2.5% spread could lead to a three-year EPS CAGR closer to 30%, highlighting the potential for meaningful earnings growth and multiple expansion compared to current market expectations. Buy at Citi means “Buy (1) ETR of 15% or more or 25% or more for High risk stocks.” What happened? On Thursday, Truist upgraded Nike Inc (NYSE:NKE) to Buy with a $97 price target. *TLDR: Truist remains cautious on Nike but sees growing optimism as expectations align with reality. Near-term wins include marketing investments, better wholesale relationships, and promoting Caitlin Clark. What’s the full story? Truist has maintained a cautious stance on Nike since the Fall of 2023. While the brokerage still views the turnaround process as long and uncertain, there is growing optimism about Nike’s shares as investor expectations now seem to accurately reflect the company’s current reality. With a team of seasoned company veterans back at the helm, Truist believes Nike is moving in the right direction. Although a fundamental recovery remains a long-term prospect, Truist sees potential for some near-term wins. These include increased investment in marketing, improved wholesale relationships, and the promotion of ambassador Caitlin Clark. The brokerage believes these efforts by the new team should be enough to demonstrate to investors that better times are ahead for Nike. Buy at Truist means “the stock’s total return is expected to outperform the S&P 500 or relevant benchmark over the next 12-18 months (unless otherwise indicated).” What happened? On Friday, JPMorgan upgraded Ferrari NV (NYSE:RACE) to Overweight with a $525 price target. *TLDR: RACE upgraded on high visibility earnings growth and resilience to China’s slowdown. RACE’s disciplined growth strategy under CEO Vigna results in record pricing, backlog, and future earnings visibility What’s the full story? JPMorgan has upgraded Ferrari shares following a series of investor meetings with CEO Benedetto Vigna and Manager of Investor Relations Aldo Benetti across several major cities in Asia and Australia. The analysts highlighted key investment positives, including unique drivers of high visibility earnings growth, which are expected to be increasingly valued by investors amidst growing macroeconomic, industry, and geopolitical uncertainties. The analysts gained greater confidence in Ferrari’s ability to navigate key debate areas such as electrification and emerged assured that Ferrari will remain resilient against the current slowdown in China, which is affecting other high-end automakers and European luxury goods brands. JPMorgan emphasized Ferrari’s disciplined growth strategy, rooted in the philosophy of delivering one car less than the market demands, as famously stated by founder Enzo Ferrari. Under CEO Vigna’s leadership, this strategy has resulted in record pricing and backlog, providing excellent visibility into future earnings growth. Ferrari’s ability to reallocate shipments from markets with softer demand, like China, to regions with stronger demand ensures no negative impact on total company profits and even higher margins. Additionally, Ferrari’s upcoming battery electric vehicle promises an exceptional driving experience, and the potential debut of its latest Supercar could provide a significant earnings boost. Overweight at JPMorgan means “over the duration of the price target indicated in this report, we expect this stock will outperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst’s, or the Research Analyst’s team’s, coverage universe.”
