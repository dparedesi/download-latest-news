Title: Amazon Shares Stall as Job Cuts Loom Against $35B AI Spending | AMZN Stock

Investing Amazon (AMZN) social sentiment dropped to negative 0.15 from a 0.12 quarterly average. Amazon plans to cut 14,000-15,000 jobs starting January 28. Amazon capex surged 55% to $35.1B in Q3. Operating income growth was just 0.06% despite 13.4% revenue growth. Amazon’s YTD return of 4.1% lags NVDA’s 27.5% and GOOGL’s 67% despite 95% analyst Buy ratings. Sending You to Google News in 3 © kasinv / iStock Editorial via Getty Images Shares of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are up 0.5% this week, but retail investor sentiment tells a darker story. The company’s social sentiment score dropped to negative 0.15 on Reddit and X over the past week, a sharp reversal from its neutral-bullish 0.12 average over the prior quarter. Among select tech peers, Amazon stands alone in sustained bearish sentiment while companies like NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) enjoy bullish or neutral enthusiasm from the retail crowd. A viral post on r/wallstreetbets captured the mood, racking up 2,744 upvotes and 406 comments in 24 hours. The post’s title bluntly stated: “Amazon Just announces a new round of Lay-offs. Combined with AI driven lay-offs.” The announcement hit AWS, retail, Prime Video, and HR divisions hardest, with CEO Andy Jassy framing the cuts as cultural changes driven by AI adoption rather than purely financial pressures. The Reddit discussion revealed deep concerns among retail investors. One highly-upvoted comment captured the anxiety: “AI is literally replacing entire departments now, not just individual roles. This is different from past layoff cycles.” Another trader noted, “They’re cutting 30K jobs while spending $35B on AI infrastructure – the math doesn’t add up for workers but makes perfect sense for margins.” A third commenter expressed skepticism about the stock’s prospects: “How is AMZN supposed to run with the Mag 7 when they’re bleeding cash on capex and cutting their workforce? The growth story is broken.” Retail traders are turning skeptical despite solid fundamentals. The concerns are tangible: Amazon’s year-to-date return of 4.1% lags dramatically behind NVDA’s 27.5% one-year gain and GOOGL’s 67% surge. While 95% of Wall Street analysts rate Amazon a Buy with a $295 target price (26% upside), retail sentiment reflects anxiety over margin compression and AI spending. NVIDIA, by contrast, maintains a 55 sentiment score with 93% analyst support, backed by 67% earnings growth and a 53% profit margin that dwarfs Amazon’s 11.1%. For investors watching major tech stocks, Amazon’s isolation in negative sentiment is striking given its Q3 earnings beat and AWS reacceleration to 20% growth.
