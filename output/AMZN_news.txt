Lately, the Mag 7 Have Become the Drag 7 The Magnificent Seven, led by Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Meta, and Tesla helped major indices soar to new heights over the past decade. Since early February 2016, the S&P 500 has appreciated 265% while the QQQs nearly doubled that performance at 450%. Chief among the QQQ’s rise has been the tech heavy members of the Magnificent Seven (aka Mag 7). Each of the Mag 7 generated peak returns, that were in some cases, well above the 450% QQQ average. Standouts such as Nvidia (+21,280%), Tesla (+4000% peak return) and mega cap heavyweights, Apple (787% peak return), Microsoft (972% peak return) and Amazon (727% peak return) helped drive the exceptional performance. While the Mag 7 reached record levels, investors cheered. Who would publicly criticize a fund or index that produced exceptional results irrespective of disproportionate weights in only a handful of stocks? But what happens when these same 7 overweight stocks start to falter? Nothing good. The same Newtonian principles that drove stock prices and indexes higher, apply the same magic in reverse. Whatever goes up can come down. Seemingly overnight, the Mag 7 have become the Drag 7. Much of the appreciation occurs due to Market Cap weighted passive indices that do not easily change the mix of stocks or assigned weights. Consequently, as money flows into various funds, the index constituents are purchased automatically. This pushes the prices and market capitalizations of the stocks, and corresponding indices, higher. This is true irrespective of perceived valuation or price. There is no check or intervention as prices rise. And as more money flows in, the pace of appreciation and momentum rise even faster due to greater weight that the constituents hold. Passive indices hold to their prescribed rules and buy or sell in a pro rata fashion as dollars flow in or out. Although there are some benefits of a passive index, principally competitive, low fees and trading costs, there is an inherent flaw. There is generally no valuation overlay. And just as a few heavily weighted stocks can push an index higher as the prices go higher, the same will happen as heavily weighted stocks fall. This is what is happening now. Heavily weighted Mag 7 stocks are falling, due to active investors selling the stocks, and dragging major passive indices down. The cracks in the impenetrable Mag 7 base begin to appear around July 8, 2024. Since, that time period most of the Mag 7 have fallen. Though market dynamics can change at any time, this should be a concern for many investors in the future. The history of the Mag 7 began many years ago. For a long time the market leaders were referred to as the “FAANGs”. This acronym corresponded with: Facebook (before it became “Meta”), Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google. Notable among the missing constituents were Microsoft and Nvidia. This was before Nvidia was recognized as an AI leader. At the time, investors were bullish on Netflix as a Covid stock darling. After Covid, Netflix fell and the moniker “FAANGs” was replaced with the broader grouping of “Mag 7”. Microsoft and Nvidia were added and Netflix disappeared. The Mag 7 proved to be a more powerful mix than the FAANGS. Investors enjoyed a strong bull market rally, and with each year, as more money flowed to passive ETFs, a disproportionate percentage of the funds went back into the Mag 7. Their market capitalizations swelled. Several companies reached $1 trillion market capitalization (META) then quickly became $2 trillion companies (AMZN and GOOGL) and then even faster to $3 trillion market cap valuations (MSFT, AAPL, NVDA). Never before had massive companies reached $1 trillion levels, let alone $2 trillion and $3 trillion. Moreover, the moves beyond $1 trillion moved with unprecedented speed. Money flowed into index funds, which pushed stock prices higher, that continued to replenish a buying cycle that added more buying pressure, which in turn, increased the stock weights of the Mag 7. Today, only a handful of stocks represent a disproportionate percentage of the weight in indexes with 100 or even 1000 companies. This is dangerous for investors and it violates the basic underlying investment principle of diversification by not putting too many eggs in one basket. By way of example, only 3 stocks (AAPL, MSFT and NVDA) now comprise 35% of the Russell 1000 Growth index. This is far too heavy and can create major problems for investors when these three stocks drop. Moreover, more than 1/2 or approximately 54% of the Russell 1000 Index now resides in the Mag 7. Concentration can be a terrific thing when the Mag 7 are rising. For example, in 2023 the Russell 1000 Growth Index generated a return of 42.60% and the Mag 7 contributed 62% of the total performance. It was even more concentrated for the Invesco QQQ which generated a return of 54.85% with 68% of the performance originating from the Mag 7. However, the table below shows what can happen when the heavy concentration in the Mag 7 starts to falter. While the concentration is terrific when the stocks rise, it can be devastating when those stocks start to decline. This is the interesting characteristic that is happening to the Magnificent Seven lately. Some of the constituents are dropping and, more importantly, rather than creating wealth for investors, at least 5 of the 7 members, are starting to lose wealth. The table below illustrates. Magnificent 7 Performance Since July 8, 2024 to Oct 11, 2024 Since July 8, 2024 through October 11, 2024, five of the Mag 7 have fallen and the Tech heavy QQQ index has been negative (-0.66%). The worst performer since July 8, is TSLA (-13.89%), followed by GOOGL (-13.53%), MSFT (-10.55%), AMZN (-5.25%) and AAPL. This has far reaching ramifications for asset allocation among portfolio managers who currently invest in large capitalization, growth-oriented baskets. Despite holding hundreds of stocks in their funds, the preponderance of the equity weights reside among only a handful of securities. Perhaps, equally important, due to the heavy concentrations of just a few securities in an index, pension consultants and other fiduciaries, whose job it is to advise clients, may find that they may soon experience legal exposure by not better diversifying their clients’ portfolios. The Table below shows the performance of the QQQ relative to another Index with a similar correlation to Technology stocks, the Entrepreneur 30 Total Return Index (ER30TR). The ER30TR Index does not hold 4 (AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, TSLA) of the Mag 7 and is underweight 2 others (GOOGL, NVDA). In this particular case, the returns for the period July 8, 2024 through October 11, 2024 were a positive 6.7% for the ER30TR while negative 0.66% for the QQQ. (Note: past performance is no guide or guarantee of future performance). QQQ's Are Negative Since 07/08/2024 to Present (10/11/2024) The returns year to date (YTD) have shown similar results. While the QQQ have generated a solid 20.99% YTD, they fall below the 23.24% SPX (S&P 500) and pale next to the 41.63% for the Entrepreneur 30 (ER30TR). (Note: past performance is no guide or guarantee of future performance). Major Stock Indexes YTD (through Oct. 11, 2024) Moreover, in the context of longer periods, it is clear that the Invesco QQQ have prospered since January 2023. In the time period January 1, 2023 through October 11, 2024, the Invesco QQQ generated an impressive 87.25% return with exactly 2/3 of the return coming from the Mag 7. This is well above the SPX return of 55.22% and far above the 33.80% return for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. However, the performance could have been much better. As the table illustrates below, the Entrepreneur 30 Total Return Index provided a return of 122.22% during the same time period with a little over 1/3 of its total return coming from the Mag 7. Moreover, the Entrepreneur 30 TR Index had only 21% of its weight coming from the Mag 7 whereas the Mag 7 represent approximately 46% of the Invesco QQQ. In other words, despite the strong performance of the Mag 7, the Entrepreneur 30 TR Index provided 1.4X the return of the QQQ (122% vs 87%) with less than 1/2 the weight of the Mag 7 (compared to the QQQ) and less than 1/2 the performance coming from the Mag 7 (compared to the QQQ). (Note: past performance is no guide or guarantee of future performance). Major Index Performances Since 12/31/2022 Is it fair to compare an index with 30 holdings with an index that has 100 holdings? If the holdings were equal weighted, then the answer would be “no”. However, in the case of the Entrepreneur 30TR (ER30TR), the weights in the Mag 7 were only 21% vs 46% for the Invesco QQQ. This means that despite having more constituents in the Invesco QQQ, the weights in the Mag 7 were much more concentrated. Moreover, 2/3 of the total returns in the QQQ were from the Mag 7, whereas only 1/3 of the returns for the ER30TR were from the Mag 7. This means that it is possible to have fewer stocks in an Index, yet have less concentration and greater returns. As a result, many investors are now beginning to seek alternatives to the concentrated nature of the QQQ and Russell 1000 Growth. Could the ER30TR be the new replacement?(Note: past performance is no guarantee or guide to future returns). Overall returns, led by the Mag 7, have generated extraordinary returns for Tech heavy indices over the past few years. But concentration to just a handful of securities becomes dangerous when the heavily-weighted holdings begin to drop. Several popular indices, such as the Russell 1000 Growth and Invesco QQQ have seen their assets under management (AUM) ascend to hundreds of billions of dollars during the past few years. The Russell 1000 Growth is now approaching $100 Billion and the Invesco QQQ are nearing $300 Billion. With each index holding approximately 1/2 its weight in the Mag 7, this implies that 2 indices, control nearly $200 Billion of the Mag 7. Many other funds and indices, as well as private funds, pension funds, SMAs (separately managed accounts) control similar weights. This concentration can be devastating to investors as the Mag 7 decline. Investors are now seeking alternatives and discovering that it may be possible to achieve higher returns with less concentration—at least for certain periods of time. The QQQ have had an extraordinary growth record in raising AUM. If the concentrated Mag 7 continue to falter, replacement indices may soon become prevalent. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Please refer to the below disclosures: https://lnkd.in/e29X6rN

Investing.com -- Here is your Pro Recap of the top takeaways from Wall Street analysts for the past week. InvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today! What happened? On Monday, Wells Fargo downgraded Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) to Equalweight with a $183 price target. *TLDR: WFC sees NT pressures on AMZN from Project Kuiper and FBA fee issues. AMZN’s margin expansion faces competition from Walmart (NYSE:WMT), reducing FBA fees by $2 billion. What’s the full story? Wells Fargo analysts note that while Amazon has been a consistent positive revision story, several factors are likely to pressure revisions in the near term. These include investments in Project Kuiper, anticipated FBA fee pressures, and moderating advertising operating income contributions. The bank’s downgrade comes on the heels of potential caps on margin expansion in the first half of 2025. Consequently, Wells Fargo has reduced its operating income estimates for 2025, 2026, and 2027 by $5.4 billion, $4.5 billion, and $5.5 billion, respectively. Despite these headwinds, Wells Fargo maintains that Amazon remains a margin expansion story, albeit at a more moderate pace than the market expects. The analysts also highlight the growing competition from Walmart, whose expanding fulfillment capabilities and competitive pricing are likely to impact Amazon’s merchant services more than consumer wallet share. This competition is expected to result in an estimated $2 billion annual reduction in FBA fees. Equalweight at Wells Fargo means “Total return on stock expected to be -10% to +10% over the next 12 months. “ What happened? On Tuesday, Wolfe Research upgraded Wells Fargo & Company (NYSE:WFC) to Outperform with a $65 price target. *TLDR: Wolfe upgraded WFC amid a challenging ~9% EPS reset for 2026. Asset cap removal expected to boost EPS, supporting the upgrade decision. What’s the full story? Wolfe upgraded Wells Fargo amid the challenging ~9% EPS reset for 2026 and the complexities of AML and regulatory risks. The decision comes after noting that WFC shares have significantly lagged behind peers by approximately 2000 basis points since April. The analysts believe that the risks to consensus EPS and Net Interest Income (NII) are now better understood, and the current valuation remains overly discounted, even with deeper cuts. Furthermore, Wolfe highlights that the removal of the asset cap is expected to provide a high-single-digit EPS boost, which is not yet reflected in the stock’s multiple. This potential tailwind, combined with the improved understanding of risks, supports the analysts’ decision to upgrade WFC. Outperform at Wolfe means “The security is projected to outperform analyst's industry coverage universe over the next 12 months.” What happened? On Wednesday, Citi upgraded Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd (NYSE:NCLH) to Buy with a $30 price target. *TLDR: Citi sees NCLH’s new strategy balancing yield and cost, mitigating runaway expenses. Potential 30% EPS CAGR if NCLH maintains a 2.5% yield/cost spread. What’s the full story? Citi analysts express confidence in Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings’ new strategy, which aims to balance yield and cost, mitigating the risk of runaway expenses. They estimate a 23% three-year EPS CAGR, potentially reaching 30% if NCLH maintains its targeted 2.5% yield/cost spread. This shift from a “quality at all costs” approach to a more balanced strategy is expected to unlock significant pricing opportunities without escalating costs. The firm’s conservative long-term estimates suggest substantial earnings upside, even if NCLH falls short of its yield/cost target. Citi’s projections indicate that maintaining the 2.5% spread could lead to a three-year EPS CAGR closer to 30%, highlighting the potential for meaningful earnings growth and multiple expansion compared to current market expectations. Buy at Citi means “Buy (1) ETR of 15% or more or 25% or more for High risk stocks.” What happened? On Thursday, Truist upgraded Nike Inc (NYSE:NKE) to Buy with a $97 price target. *TLDR: Truist remains cautious on Nike but sees growing optimism as expectations align with reality. Near-term wins include marketing investments, better wholesale relationships, and promoting Caitlin Clark. What’s the full story? Truist has maintained a cautious stance on Nike since the Fall of 2023. While the brokerage still views the turnaround process as long and uncertain, there is growing optimism about Nike’s shares as investor expectations now seem to accurately reflect the company’s current reality. With a team of seasoned company veterans back at the helm, Truist believes Nike is moving in the right direction. Although a fundamental recovery remains a long-term prospect, Truist sees potential for some near-term wins. These include increased investment in marketing, improved wholesale relationships, and the promotion of ambassador Caitlin Clark. The brokerage believes these efforts by the new team should be enough to demonstrate to investors that better times are ahead for Nike. Buy at Truist means “the stock’s total return is expected to outperform the S&P 500 or relevant benchmark over the next 12-18 months (unless otherwise indicated).” What happened? On Friday, JPMorgan upgraded Ferrari NV (NYSE:RACE) to Overweight with a $525 price target. *TLDR: RACE upgraded on high visibility earnings growth and resilience to China’s slowdown. RACE’s disciplined growth strategy under CEO Vigna results in record pricing, backlog, and future earnings visibility What’s the full story? JPMorgan has upgraded Ferrari shares following a series of investor meetings with CEO Benedetto Vigna and Manager of Investor Relations Aldo Benetti across several major cities in Asia and Australia. The analysts highlighted key investment positives, including unique drivers of high visibility earnings growth, which are expected to be increasingly valued by investors amidst growing macroeconomic, industry, and geopolitical uncertainties. The analysts gained greater confidence in Ferrari’s ability to navigate key debate areas such as electrification and emerged assured that Ferrari will remain resilient against the current slowdown in China, which is affecting other high-end automakers and European luxury goods brands. JPMorgan emphasized Ferrari’s disciplined growth strategy, rooted in the philosophy of delivering one car less than the market demands, as famously stated by founder Enzo Ferrari. Under CEO Vigna’s leadership, this strategy has resulted in record pricing and backlog, providing excellent visibility into future earnings growth. Ferrari’s ability to reallocate shipments from markets with softer demand, like China, to regions with stronger demand ensures no negative impact on total company profits and even higher margins. Additionally, Ferrari’s upcoming battery electric vehicle promises an exceptional driving experience, and the potential debut of its latest Supercar could provide a significant earnings boost. Overweight at JPMorgan means “over the duration of the price target indicated in this report, we expect this stock will outperform the average total return of the stocks in the Research Analyst’s, or the Research Analyst’s team’s, coverage universe.”

Title: Treasury Yields Have Been Rising. How Might That Affect Your Stock Portfolio?

The yield on 10-year Treasurys crossed 4.1% for the first time since July this week, extending an ascent that has paradoxically coincided with the beginning of a rate-cutting cycle. The yield on the 10-year Treasury has risen by about half a percentage point since dipping below 3.6% on Sept. 17, the day before the Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark federal funds rate from its highest level in more than 20 years. Stock investors are often unnerved by rising yields for a few reasons. First, they draw money away from the stock market and lower stock valuations by increasing the yield on lower-risk fixed-income securities. Second, they discourage consumer and business borrowing, weighing on economic growth and corporate profits in the process. Yet rising Treasury yields haven't stood in the way of stocks in recent weeks. The S&P 500 on Friday closed at its 45th record high of the year as the 10-year yield was at a two-month high. Major stock indexes have posted gains in five consecutive weeks. Stocks have been supported lately by growing conviction on Wall Street that the U.S. economy’s strength can support corporate profits. Earnings have mostly held up through years of elevated interest rates, and the Fed’s easing cycle—whether aggressive or more measured—should mostly be a tailwind for business and stocks. Bank of America analysts expect S&P 500 earnings to grow 15% next year. They also forecast growth will continue to broaden beyond the Magnificent Seven—Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOG; GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA)—which accounted for an outsized share of the index’s earnings growth and market performance in 2023. The "Other 493," the earnings of which were declining or stagnant throughout 2023 and early 2024, are expected to record double-digit earnings growth in each of the next five quarters. According to one study from British asset manager Schroders, rising yields compressed stock valuations in 6 of the 11 periods between 1970 and 2021 that they characterize as "rising yield environments." And yet stocks advanced in all but two of those periods because earnings grew fast enough to offset lower valuations. Few experts expect the 10-year yield to rise much further than it already has, another reason yields are unlikely to derail the bull market. “The US economy is healthy & unlikely to see recession near term but it also doesn't appear to be meaningfully re-accelerating,” wrote Bank of America analysts in a recent note. They expect the Fed to continue cutting rates next year, and forecast the 10-year yield will sit around 3.75% at the end of both 2024 and 2025. Lawrence Gillum, Chief Fixed Income Strategist at LPL Financial, sees a little more room for rates to tick up but still expects yields to fluctuate within a 3.75-4.25% range throughout the rest of the year. The surprising strength of the U.S. economy is a key reason for the peculiar divergence between interest rates and yields. The unemployment rate declined in September when the U.S. added far more jobs than expected, according to data from the Labor Department released last week. And inflation ran slightly hot in September, according to data released Thursday. That’s led Wall Street to doubt the Fed will need to continue aggressively cutting rates to prevent an economic crisis. Last month, the prevailing view among market participants was that the Fed would lower rates by another 75 basis points (0.75%) before the end of the year. Now, the market sees no chance the Fed will move that quickly, according to fed fund futures trading data. As the outlook for interest rates has changed, so has the market price of Treasurys and, subsequently, their yields, which move in the opposite direction of prices. When investors think that interest rates are going to be lower in the future than they are now, that increases the price—and decreases the yield—of Treasurys trading on the secondary market because they’re expected to pay a higher coupon than future debt. The opposite happens when investors think interest rates will be higher in the future, and the strength of recent labor market data has convinced Wall Street of that.

Amazon Pharmacy is expanding its pharmacy services to 20 more U.S. cities by 2025, offering fast, free delivery of prescription medications. Amazon’s new pharmacies will be embedded within its Same-Day Delivery sites, enabling swift medication delivery. The service offers a digital-first experience, 24/7 access to pharmacists, and various ways to save on prescriptions. By 2025, nearly 45% of U.S. customers are expected to be eligible for same-day delivery, allowing medications to arrive within hours of being ordered. Leveraging its vast logistics network, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN aims to provide a rapid, efficient pharmacy service that directly delivers medications to customers’ doors. Dr. Vin Gupta, Chief Medical Officer of Amazon Pharmacy, emphasized the importance of rapid access to prescriptions. “There’s often a crucial window after diagnosis when starting medication is most critical,” he said. Amazon’s pharmacy expansion also aims to address the growing issue of “pharmacy deserts,” where many communities are over 10 miles away from the nearest pharmacy. Traditional mail-order prescriptions often take up to 10 days to arrive, leaving many underserved. Amazon’s rapid delivery and pharmacist availability close the care gap, especially in areas with limited access to healthcare services. John Love, VP of Amazon Pharmacy, highlighted Amazon’s efforts to streamline medication delivery and offer clear pricing, automatic coupons, and discounts for Prime members. Innovations such as RxPass, a $5-a-month subscription for 60 common medications, and savings of up to 80% on generics demonstrate Amazon’s commitment to making healthcare more accessible and affordable. Since its launch in 2020, Amazon Pharmacy has integrated technology to modernize pharmacy operations while maintaining clinical oversight. Hannah McClellan, VP of Operations, Product, and Technology at Amazon Pharmacy, added that feedback from customers and physicians has been overwhelmingly positive, reinforcing the importance of fast medication delivery. Price Action: At last check Thursday, AMZN stock was up 0.99% at $187 during the premarket session. Read Next: Photo by Koshiro K via Shutterstock © 2024 Benzinga.com.

Title: Macro Guru Hugh Hendry Betting on Bitcoin (BTC) and Lower Interest Rates for 2025 – Here’s Why
URL: https://dailyhodl.com/2024/10/10/macro-guru-hugh-hendry-betting-on-bitcoin-btc-and-lower-interest-rates-for-2025-heres-why/
Time Published: 2024-10-10T07:04:16Z

Hedge fund manager Hugh Hendry is betting on Bitcoin (BTC) and low interest rates next year. Hendry says there “always two ever-present tail risks” in a short volatility investment strategy, which aims to profit off decreases in market volatility by selling options. “Do you buy the call option that the Mag-7 become capitalized at 100% of GDP or that rates descend rapidly to the lower bound? That’s why I keep hammering on about observing where stock levels are on the day of the next cut. I’m running a barbell: long BTC and long calls on <2% Fed Funds at year end 2025 I am of course exposed to a tracking error, that stocks surge and bitcoin is flat or down on some idiosyncratic news. I’m content to run that risk.” Mag-7 refers to the “Magnificent Seven” tech stocks: Alphabet (GOOGL; GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT), NVIDIA (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA). Hendry also compares Bitcoin’s size to the Invesco QQQ, an exchange-traded fund (ETF) based on the Nasdaq-100 Index. “BTC is everyone’s phantom, good or bad. In reality, its MASS renders it irrelevant to this conversation but highly attractive for upside consideration. In the game of Newton’s Cradle, MASS is paramount today, it’s the outlier. BTC’s capitalization is just $1 trillion. QQQ is $42 trillion. The Qs, or rather the $13 trillion in the Mag-7, are therefore the only consideration. Bank stock lending renders the robustness of that valuation paramount. If that melts, the credit unravels, the margin call is immense. Perhaps doesn’t happen, but if I were a bank I’d be circumspect about the moneyness of that collateral. I’d be trying to contra-cyclically reduce my assets, markets and their liquidity permitting. By moneyness I mean the pledged assets’ proximity to a t-bill. Your t-bill ain’t gonna lose 83% of its value over the next 18 months. Bur stocks capitalized at these vaunted levels vis-a-vis GDP have periodically suffered such reversals.” Generated Image: Midjourney Covering the future of finance, including macro, bitcoin, ethereum, crypto, and web 3.
