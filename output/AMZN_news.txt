Title: Oracle's Stock is Red Hot. So Why Is Wall Street Divided?

Could Oracle (ORCL) be this year’s next big AI-fueled hypergrowth story? It's already had a blockbuster 2024. After a recent runup powered by an upbeat AI-fueled outlook, the database giant has become the second best-performing tech stock in the S&P 500 of the year—trailing only AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA). The surge has thrilled shareholders and enriched founder Larry Ellison, who is in a nip-and-tuck race with Amazon's (AMZN) Jeff Bezos to be the world’s second-richest person. But while some hot stocks get the full backing of Wall Street, analysts are divided about what's next for Oracle. The mean price target on Oracle's shares is currently $174.67, according to Visible Alpha, only a modest 4% above Friday's close. Oracle, with a client base that includes Fortune 500 companies as well as governments, remains one of the world’s leading database enterprise companies, though it faces rising competition from newer rivals in an increasingly cloud-centric environment. And there is plenty of support for Oracle out there, with more than half of the analysts tracked by Visible Alpha currently sporting "buy" ratings on the shares. Jefferies analysts said they believe Oracle could be "getting its mojo back” after attending the company’s recent CloudWorld event, where the tech stalwart said it expects sales to nearly double in the next five years on AI-driven demand for cloud services. Bernstein called Oracle their “top investment idea” after the event, citing Oracle’s cloud services growth, AI vision, and the shift of its flagship database business to the cloud, writing that “the sun shines in the Oracle Cloud.” Recent agreements with Big Three cloud providers Amazon, Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google, as well as its "AI-first cloud architecture" could also play a role in helping Oracle support growth, according to Melius analysts, who see those partnerships as a signal that those companies "need to work with Oracle to keep driving their own Cloud segment growth to please investors." Bernstein analysts said the partnerships could also give Oracle opportunities to introduce its services to new customers, as well as sell existing customers on a wider range of offerings. “Now that the train has left the station, we believe investors will continue to reward Oracle for faster revenue growth,” Melius analysts wrote. Some analysts, however, expressed skepticism about Oracle's ability to deliver on its new growth targets and suggested they could leave the company little room for error. At Oracle's annual briefing for financial analysts, the company said it expects its revenue will rise to at least $104 billion by fiscal 2029, nearly doubling the $53 billion Oracle reported in June for fiscal 2024. The company also raised its sales projection for fiscal 2026 to at least $66 billion, up from an earlier $65 billion. Both of those figures were well ahead of the analyst consensus compiled by Visible Alpha. Citi analysts called the new targets "aggressive" and said Oracle could be “reaching for the sky" with its projections. "It's hard for us to underwrite," they wrote. "We're comfortable on the sidelines.”

Title: Forget Amazon, This Stock Has 85% Market Share And 2x Upside

06 February 2024, Rhineland-Palatinate, Mainz: A police commissioner holds a Taser on the sidelines ... [+] of the presentation of the new police law in the courtyard of the Ministry of the Interior. Photo: Arne Dedert/dpa (Photo by Arne Dedert/picture alliance via Getty Images) Axon Enterprise stock (NASDAQ: AXON) has had a solid run, rising by almost 3x over the past two years from levels of about $124 per share in September 2022 to about $380 presently. There is a high probability that this run is unlikely to lose steam anytime soon, for this run is backed by solid business performance. For context, Axon Enterprise is a tech company and it has 85% market share in one of its products viz. body cameras that the company sells to police departments in all the major American cities. While market share in only one product should not be the only focus, the fact that the company has witnessed surging demand across its services/product lines, right from cloud services, to solutions for drones and body cameras, indicates that the company must be doing something special. For context, Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) has that kind of market share in search, while Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) does not have that in e-commerce. Consequently, barring small fluctuations, Axon’s stock price movement has largely been one-sided since reaching a temporary low below $100 back in June 2022. The stock has gained a solid 48% YTD and has comfortably outperformed its peers in the aerospace and defense industry, viz. Textron (NYSE: TXT), up 8%, Huntington Ingalls Industries (NYSE: HII), down 1%, and Spirit AeroSystems (NYSE: SPR), up 10%, in this period. Has the peak been reached? At the current price level, Axon Enterprise stock trades at about 100x trailing earnings and 16x its trailing revenues. Is this a reasonable multiple? Possibly yes! Especially if you consider the fact that the company’s revenues have the potential to grow by more than 30% annually in the next few years. Over the last few years, the company has consistently reported strong revenue growth with an average growth of 30% in the last 5 years and the trend is not likely to reverse anytime soon. Moreover, the company’s net margin has witnessed a significant improvement in the last couple of years to reach over 10%. We outline a path for the stock to rise to levels of about $1000 per share in the next few years by looking at the company’s potential revenue growth, net margins, and its price-to-earnings multiple on the back of a strong sales pipeline, which has grown across product categories and customer verticals. AXON Has Done It In The Past AXON stock has generated better returns than the broader market in each of the last 3 years. Returns for the stock were 28% in 2021, 6% in 2022, and 56% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could AXON see a strong jump? Revenue growth coupled with margin expansion is the key Axon reports its revenues under two segments – TASER, which includes sales of its conducted energy devices (CEDs), batteries, accessories and extended warranties, and Software & Sensors – which includes integrated hardware and cloud-based software solutions for law enforcement. These segments accounted for 39% and 61% of the company’s total sales last year. While the TASER segment sales have risen 40% between 2021 and 2023, the Software & Sensors segment sales have surged over 2x over this period. Now, the company is focused on improving its recurring revenues from its cloud-based solutions. The recurring revenues have been rising at a fast pace from $327 million in 2021 to $732 million in 2023, and $850 million as of June 30, 2024. The overall increase in public safety spending clubbed with the increasing reliance on recurring revenues will likely propel the company to see meaningful growth in sales over the next few years. With an increasing scale of operations, AXON is also expected to steadily improve its business margins due to higher absorption of its fixed overheads, which in turn would result in net income increasing by a steady rate. Consequently, if AXON’s revenues grow by about 2.5x between FY’24 and FY’27, with margins expanding by about 1.5x over the same period, this would imply that earnings can grow by around 3.8x. Now if earnings grow 3.8x, the P/E multiple will shrink to less than a third of its current level, assuming the stock price stays the same. But that’s exactly what Axon Enterprise’s investors are betting will not happen! If earnings expand 3.8x over the next few years, instead of the P/E shrinking from around 100x presently to ~26x, we think that the multiple could stand at about 60x. This could make a 2.6x rise in Axon Enterprise’s stock a real possibility in the coming years — with the stock rising to levels of almost $1000. What about the time horizon for this high-return scenario? In practice, it won’t make much difference whether it takes 3 years or 5 — as long as Axon Enterprise is on this revenue and earnings expansion trajectory, with margins trending up, the stock price could respond similarly.
