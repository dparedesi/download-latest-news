We recently published a list of 10 AI News and Ratings Investors Should Take a Look At. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against other AI news and ratings investors should take a look at. As AI continues to reshape industries, investors are closely watching how companies allocate capital during concerns over high valuations. According to some experts, despite market fluctuations, businesses are unlikely to cut AI investments significantly, as the technology’s long-term impact is still unfolding. The comparison to the dot-com era raises questions about sustainability, but many see AI as an innovation cycle that will drive broader economic growth. Marta Norton, chief investment strategist at Empower, believes companies are unlikely to significantly alter their AI-related spending despite concerns over high valuations, especially as DeepSeek raises questions about supply chains. She discussed this on Bloomberg Technology with Caroline Hyde and Mike Shepard, emphasizing that the market is still in an AI investment race and earnings reports will be key in determining future spending patterns. She noted that recent market reactions have been more about valuation concerns than doubts about AI itself. While Nvidia remains central to AI supply chains, the debate is now shifting to whether businesses need to keep spending at the current pace. Comparing the situation to the dot-com era, Norton acknowledged the risks of high valuations but pointed out that major technological shifts, like AI, can drive long-term economic expansion, similar to how the internet transformed industries. On the potential impact of cheaper AI solutions, she suggested that businesses, including retailers and software firms, could benefit from faster, more efficient deployments. However, she cautioned that these effects may take time to materialize rather than being immediately reflected in quarterly earnings. Addressing concerns about broader market disruption, she acknowledged vulnerabilities in major tech stocks but argued that the fundamental case for AI remains strong, with the primary uncertainty revolving around supply chains rather than AI adoption itself. For this article, we selected AI stocks by reviewing news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

A customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 286 Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) incorporates AI across shopping, entertainment, and operations, fueling innovation through investments, AWS collaborations, and Tranium. On January 30, TipRanks reported that Bank of America’s Justin Post reaffirmed a Buy rating on Amazon with a $255 price target. The firm mentioned strong demand for AWS and its expected 19-20% year-over-year growth in Q4. He highlighted Amazon’s investments in infrastructure, including Trainium chips, as key to sustaining future growth. The company’s practice of billing primarily in USD also helps reduce foreign exchange risks, supporting its overall financial stability. Overall, AMZN ranks 1st on our list of AI news and ratings investors should take a look at. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks for Beginners with Little Money According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other beginner-friendly stocks. Uncertainty sweeps across the US with the incoming administration’s potential policies. Simultaneously, the Federal Reserve has decided to pause its rate-cutting cycle and the decision to resume easing is doubtful amidst Trump's trade policies which are being deemed inflationary. Tariffs on foreign imports are considered a risk of reviving inflation. According to Reuters, Dustin Reid, chief strategist of fixed income at Mackenzie Investments in Toronto, reiterated the uncertainty looming as follows: "Everything that is going on right now, from economic data to markets news and tariffs, adds up to a lot more uncertainty across all markets" Recently, technology stocks benefitting from the business potential of AI witnessed a deep shock as Chinese startup DeepSeek revealed a large language model that can compete with American AI giants but at a fraction of the cost of OpenAI’s, Google’s, or Meta’s popular AI models. DeepSeek unveiled a free, open-source large language model that it claims took only two months and less than $6 to build. The event raised a lot of concerns over America’s leadership in the AI sector and how big tech giants are investing heavily in AI models and data centers while DeepSeek somehow developed a highly competitive model without having as much compute as U.S. hyperscalers, as pointed out by Srini Pajjuri, semiconductor analyst at Raymond James. While the US has been trying to limit China’s access to the chips powering advanced AI systems, the news about DeepSeek’s chatbot making it to most-downloaded free app in the US on Apple’s App Store demonstrates the country’s rapid gains in the sector. Our Methodology: In order to compile a list of the 10 best stocks for beginners with little money according to hedge funds, we used a consensus of similar rankings as well as blue-chip ETFs. Moving on, we shortlisted the top 10 stocks from our list which had the highest number of hedge fund holders. The 10 best stocks for beginners with little money according to hedge funds have been arranged in ascending order of their hedge fund holders as of Q3. At Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 286 Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a leading e-commerce company that has grown in a variety of businesses such as its core e-commerce operations, cloud services, as well as digital advertising. Additionally, Amazon manufactures and sells electronic devices such as Kindle, Ring, Blink, Fire tablet, Fire TV, and Echo. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) serves as a global leader in e-commerce, cloud computing, and digital streaming. The company posted better-than-expected earnings and revenue for its most recent quarter, with Amazon’s cloud and advertising units showing strong growth. Ahead of the new earnings for Q4 2024 which are to be released on February 6, several Wall Street firms agree the e-commerce and cloud giant boasts the strongest setup among the mega-cap tech companies going into the earnings season, as reported by CNBC. Jefferies analyst Brent Thill maintained a Buy rating on the stock and set a price target of $275. On January 24, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) also got a Buy rating from Scotiabank’s Nat Schindler. Lisa Schreiber from Gradient Investments emphasized Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) being one of her top picks for 2025 as follows: “It’s the leader in online retail and is very well-diversified with its cloud-based business, where it’s also a leader. Additionally, its ad business is gaining momentum and doing very well. Together with the fact that the path to AI monetization seems clearer for Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) compared to other big names, we just have to recall their latest commentary around their cloud business, where they plan to introduce their own AI chip, which could potentially rival Nvidia down the road. The introduction of their AI agents is also increasing efficiency in their online retail. I think all of that presents great opportunities for 2025.” Overall AMZN ranks 1st on our list of the best stocks for beginners with little money according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some deeply undervalued AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a deeply undervalued AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.
