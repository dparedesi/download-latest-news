Shares of AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) and a slew of other stocks related to AI sold off Monday as an app from Chinese AI startup DeepSeek boomed in popularity. DeepSeek's AI assistant recently topped the list of free iPhone apps on Apple's (AAPL) app store. (It wasn't in the top 10 on Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google Play store, though it is listed there.) In Apple's store, the app ranked higher than ChatGPT; not so on Google. Here’s what you need to know about DeepSeek—and why it’s having a big impact on markets. And if you're wondering if it wasn't that long ago that another Chinese app was topping the download charts, you're not wrong. DeepSeek, a Chinese startup founded by hedge fund manager Liang Wenfeng, was founded in 2023 in Hangzhou, China, the tech hub home to Alibaba (BABA) and many of China’s other high-flying tech giants. The company says its latest R1 AI model released last week offers performance that is on par with that of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Its V3 base model launched in December was also reportedly developed in just two months for under $6 million, at a time when the U.S. is limiting China's access to its most sophisticated chips and American AI leaders like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta Platforms (META) are spending billions of dollars on development. The rapid ascension of DeepSeek has investors worried it could threaten assumptions about how much competitive AI models cost to develop, as well as the kind of infrastructure needed to support them, with wide-reaching implications for the AI marketplace and Big Tech shares. Nvidia in a statement called DeepSeek "an excellent AI advancement," calling it a "perfect example" of a concept known as test time scaling. The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell more than 3% Monday as investors dragged a host of stocks with ties to AI, from chip to energy firms, downwards. Shares of American AI chipmakers including Nvidia, Broadcom (AVGO) and AMD (AMD) sold off, along with those of international partners like TSMC (TSM). The PHLX Semiconductor Index (SOX) dropped more than 9%. Networking solutions and hardware partner stocks dropped along with them, including Dell (Dell), Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and Arista Networks (ANET). Some energy stocks were hit too. Shares of nuclear and other energy companies that saw their stocks boom in the last year in anticipation of an AI-driven boom in energy demand, such as Vistra (VST), Constellation Energy (CEG), Oklo (OKLO), and NuScale (SMR), also lost ground Monday. Meanwhile, some non-tech sectors like consumer staples rose Monday, marking a reconsideration of the market's momentum in recent months. Several analysts raised doubts about the longevity of the market’s reaction Monday, suggesting that the day's pullback could offer investors a chance to pick up AI names set for a rebound. Bernstein’s Stacy Rasgon called the reaction “overblown” and maintained an “outperform” rating for Nvidia’s stock price. Citi analysts, who said they expect AI companies to continue buying its advanced chips, maintained a "buy" rating on Nvidia. Wedbush analysts, who voiced skepticism that any major U.S. companies would use a Chinese startup like DeepSeek to build their AI infrastructure, said “launching a competitive LLM model for consumer use cases is one thing… launching broader AI infrastructure is a whole other ballgame and nothing with DeepSeek makes us believe anything different.” Wedbush called Monday a “golden buying opportunity” to own shares in ChatGPT backer Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet, Palantir (PLTR), and other heavyweights of the American AI ecosystem that had come under pressure.

Title: Why Nvidia Stock Is Plummeting Today

Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) tumbled Monday after the release of a sophisticated artificial intelligence model from a Chinese startup prompted a reckoning on Wall Street regarding AI spending. Chinese company DeepSeek last week released R1, an AI model that appears to rival the capabilities of models from U.S. tech giants like OpenAI and Google despite running on fewer, less powerful chips. U.S. investors began to take notice of the model late last week, and over the weekend started to worry about what it means for richly valued U.S. tech stocks. Nvidia’s earnings and stock price have soared in the past two years as tech giants like Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG)(GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN) have spent massively on the company's AI systems. DeepSeek has led investors to question whether all that spending was necessary and, if not, why it would continue. Nvidia stock was hammered by Monday’s sell-off. Shares tumbled nearly 17%, its largest one-day drop since the Covid-19 crash in March 2020. Monday’s sell-off wiped about $589 billion from Nvidia’s market cap, the largest loss in history. Wall Street analysts were mostly skeptical about DeepSeek and the sell-off it prompted, though their commentary often reflected uncertainty about the effects DeepSeek could have on the market. Citi analysts expressed doubt that DeepSeek had achieved its results without the most advanced chips. They maintained their "buy" rating on Nvidia stock and said they don't expect major U.S. AI companies to move away from using its advanced GPUs. Jefferies analysts, however, noted DeepSeek's success could press Silicon Valley management to "refocus on efficiency and ROI, meaning lower demand for computing power as of 2026." Concern about future AI models requiring less computing power weighed on other high-flying AI stocks, including nuclear power providers Vistra (VST) and Constellation Energy Corp. (CEG), which slumped 28% and 21%, respectively. Nvidia competitor Broadcom (AVGO) also dropped about 17%.

Title: The Nasdaq sinks more than 800 points as a China AI threat sparks a huge tech stock sell-off

The tech-heavy Nasdaq slipped 3% Monday afternoon as a perceived threat from Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek prompted a global sell-off of tech stocks. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, an index of 30 of the largest U.S. companies including Nvidia (NVDA), went up 109 points or 0.2% as of Monday afternoon. Moreover, the S&P 500 tumbled by 1.8%. The Nasdaq, which has been significantly boosted by AI hype, is especially susceptible to any investor concerns, especially when it comes to AI. And the rise of any competitor to U.S. dominance in the space, especially one that uses less energy and has less of a need for high-end chips, can cause fears to spike. DeepSeek in December launched a free, open source large language model (LLM), which it claimed it had developed in just two months for less than $6 million. Last week, the company said it launched a model that rivals OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Meta’s (META) Llama 3.1 — and which rose to the top of Apple’s (AAPL) App Store over the weekend. Most notably, DeepSeek built the model using lower capability chips from Nvidia, which could put pressure on the semiconductor darling if other firms move away from its premium offerings.

Other major chip stocks also sank, including ASML (ASML), Broadcom (AVGO), Super Micro Computer (SMCI), Micron (MU), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM). “U.S. tech companies are trading at premium valuations, with major AI players like Nvidia, Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet (GOOGL) commanding forward [price-to-earnings] multiples far above historical averages,” said Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at investment platform Saxo, in a statement. “With these stocks priced for perfection, even minor disruptions, such as DeepSeek proving advanced AI can be built without top-tier chips, could weigh heavily on share prices.” Analysts at Wedbush said DeepSeek is not yet a real threat to U.S. hyperscalers, and could prompt further capital expenditure from major firms like Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet, and Microsoft. This week, significant earnings reports are due from big tech companies, such as Apple (AAPL), Tesla (TSLA), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT).
