Title: Nvidia Stock May See Its Biggest Post-Earnings Move in a Year This Week

Artificial intelligence bellwether Nvidia (NVDA) is slated to report quarterly results after markets close on Wednesday, and traders are prepared for a big stock move. Nvidia stock is expected to move approximately 6.2% in either direction by the end of the week, according to options pricing data. That big of a move from Tuesday's close would put shares at either $192.88, an all-time high that translates to a $4.7 trillion market capitalization, or $170.66, its lowest price since mid-July. Nvidia has reported earnings 10 times since the release of ChatGPT in late 2022 sparked the AI craze that’s made it the world’s most valuable company. The stock posted double-digit gains in the days after four of those reports, most recently in May 2024. But Nvidia’s earnings have struggled recently to clear the exceptionally high bar set by Wall Street. In the past four quarters, Nvidia stock has moved an average of 3.2% between reporting earnings and the end of the week. On only one of those occasions—the most recent report in May—did Nvidia finish the week above where it was before reporting earnings. Investors will be scrutinizing Nvidia’s report Wednesday for confirmation that AI demand remains strong. Hyperscalers Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), and Amazon (AMZN) all recently stood by plans to spend hundreds of billions of dollars this year on data center infrastructure and other capital goods, citing robust demand for AI and cloud computing. Nvidia, with an estimated 80% to 90% share of the AI chip market, should be the biggest beneficiary of that spending. Wall Street will also be hoping for updates on sales to China. Nvidia warned in May that the Trump administration’s decision to tighten Biden-era export controls could cost it up to $8 billion in lost revenue in the second quarter. Earlier this month, Nvidia and competitor Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) struck a deal with the Trump administration that allows them to resume sales to China in exchange for a 15% cut. That deal came too late to have any impact on Wednesday’s results, but it should be factored into Nvidia’s guidance. Analysts are overwhelmingly bullish on Nvidia. Of the 14 analysts tracked by Visible Alpha with current ratings on Nvidia’s stock, 13 rate it a “Buy” and one gives it a neutral “Hold” rating. The average price target of $203.38 is about 12% above Nvidia’s closing price on Tuesday. Update—August 26, 2025: This story has been updated with the latest options and share prices.

Title: Which Mag Seven Stocks Should You Own?

ByBill Sarubbi, Contributor. The market is likely to close the year at new highs. Here is the reasoning: Edgar Laurence Smith described the decennial pattern in the 1930s. He found that specific years in each decade had brought regular stock market patterns. For example, years ending in zero had the worst returns while years ending in five have had the best. Years ending in seven have tended to bring crises. The histogram of expected return below details the strength of fifth years based upon the Dow Jones average from 1885. As we can see, the remainder of 2025 has a bullish bias. 1-Dow Jones Monthly Histogram in Years Ending In Five September has historically been the weakest month of the year. However, the ‘five’ influence tends to keep the bear away in the autumn. Here are the bullish percentages (the likelihood that the market will rise) for autumn months for the DJIA since 1885: As we can see, this viewpoint projects higher prices in September-October. Which of the Magnificent Seven stocks should be held? In order to answer this question, relative strength, seasonal and dynamic cycles are analyzed. The unique and proprietary Cycles Research Relative Strength Value screen measures all stocks on the same basis. The seven stocks are ranked below versus the NASDAQ Composite. When reading the table, keep in mind that the NASDAQ value is 97.5. So, Tesla and Apple are lagging the benchmark. NVIDIA= 109.5 Meta= 104.6 Alphabet= 103.4 Microsoft= 99.7 Amazon= 98.7 Tesla= 96.1 Apple=94.0 Analysis is concentrated on top-ranked NVIDIA. The monthly cycle has been accurate in 2025. There is a cycle peak now leading to a low in September. In fact, September has been the fourth-weakest month in any year, so both the dynamic and the seasonal cycles point to lower prices. Add to positions in late September. 2-NVDA Monthly Cycle META’s relative strength began to rise in April, making it one of the stronger stocks in this group. Price and relative strength are at new highs. The coming months have not been strong, but this is based upon only 14 years of data. Besides, the monthly cycle below rises into December. Hold the shares. 3-META Monthly Cycle Alphabet is a mixed picture. Relative strength bottomed in May but has been inconsistent since 2024. The monthly cycle is at a peak now, suggesting that the next buy point is in October. Seasonality has not been very bullish in the second half of the year. The stock is unlikely to outperform the current leaders in the Mag 7. 4-Alphabet Monthly Cycle Microsoft’s relative uptrend began in February, earlier than the other Mag 7 stocks. This stock is one of the few that features an upturn in monthly momentum. The monthly cycle tops in September and falls into yearend. The sell cycles in this stock have been less accurate than the buy signals over the last year. The conclusion is that the share price will rise into yearend but may begin to underperform the other Mag 7 members. 5-Microsoft Monthly Cycle Amazon is seasonally strong in the second half of any year, and the monthly cycle is rising. This is the best cycle combination. In fact, September and November have been two of the most bullish months over the last 28 years. This stock is likely to rise in performance into yearend. Add to positions. 6-Amazon Monthly Cycle The relative strength of Tesla actually topped in May. From now into yearend, only November has shown exceptional strength. The dynamic monthly cycle declines into September, rises into early November and then declines again. It is doubtful that this stock will rise in strength versus its Mag 7 brethren. 7-Tesla Monthly Cycle Apple has been falling in relative terms through 2025. September has been the weakest month in any year over the last 45 years, up only 35% of the time. Note that the monthly cycle peaks now and declines into yearend. All three downturns in the last 12 months have brought the shares down. Underweight or sell this stock. 8-Apple Monthly Cycle
