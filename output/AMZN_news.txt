Investing Amazon (AMZN) social sentiment dropped to negative 0.15 from a 0.12 quarterly average. Amazon plans to cut 14,000-15,000 jobs starting January 28. Amazon capex surged 55% to $35.1B in Q3. Operating income growth was just 0.06% despite 13.4% revenue growth. Amazon’s YTD return of 4.1% lags NVDA’s 27.5% and GOOGL’s 67% despite 95% analyst Buy ratings. Sending You to Google News in 3 © kasinv / iStock Editorial via Getty Images Shares of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are up 0.5% this week, but retail investor sentiment tells a darker story. The company’s social sentiment score dropped to negative 0.15 on Reddit and X over the past week, a sharp reversal from its neutral-bullish 0.12 average over the prior quarter. Among select tech peers, Amazon stands alone in sustained bearish sentiment while companies like NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) enjoy bullish or neutral enthusiasm from the retail crowd. A viral post on r/wallstreetbets captured the mood, racking up 2,744 upvotes and 406 comments in 24 hours. The post’s title bluntly stated: “Amazon Just announces a new round of Lay-offs. Combined with AI driven lay-offs.” The announcement hit AWS, retail, Prime Video, and HR divisions hardest, with CEO Andy Jassy framing the cuts as cultural changes driven by AI adoption rather than purely financial pressures. The Reddit discussion revealed deep concerns among retail investors. One highly-upvoted comment captured the anxiety: “AI is literally replacing entire departments now, not just individual roles. This is different from past layoff cycles.” Another trader noted, “They’re cutting 30K jobs while spending $35B on AI infrastructure – the math doesn’t add up for workers but makes perfect sense for margins.” A third commenter expressed skepticism about the stock’s prospects: “How is AMZN supposed to run with the Mag 7 when they’re bleeding cash on capex and cutting their workforce? The growth story is broken.” Retail traders are turning skeptical despite solid fundamentals. The concerns are tangible: Amazon’s year-to-date return of 4.1% lags dramatically behind NVDA’s 27.5% one-year gain and GOOGL’s 67% surge. While 95% of Wall Street analysts rate Amazon a Buy with a $295 target price (26% upside), retail sentiment reflects anxiety over margin compression and AI spending. NVIDIA, by contrast, maintains a 55 sentiment score with 93% analyst support, backed by 67% earnings growth and a 53% profit margin that dwarfs Amazon’s 11.1%. For investors watching major tech stocks, Amazon’s isolation in negative sentiment is striking given its Q3 earnings beat and AWS reacceleration to 20% growth.

First, short selling doesn’t fit my personality. I like to think of myself as a positive person, and many years ago, I vowed that I would not let any part of my life, personal or professional, be ruled by fear. Shorting is a negative thing by its very nature and is often based on fear, so it is just not something with which I am comfortable. More important than its effect on my fragile feelings, though, selling a stock short always comes with significant risk. The potential losses when you short a stock are literally infinite. If you buy something and it goes to zero, you lose what you paid for the position, but if you sell something short and it keeps going up, you can lose many times your initial stake. Of course, that is manageable, at least to some degree, for those who set and stick to stop loss orders when running a position, but if you have ever canceled a stop when a price got close, think long and hard before entering a short position in a stock. Then there is something that I have mentioned here before: if a price looks “wrong” to you, it is far more likely that you have missed something than it is that the entire market has got it wrong and you are right. Still, with all that said, I believe there is one very popular energy stock that should be shorted at current levels…Bloom Energy (BE).

Then there is something that I have mentioned here before: if a price looks “wrong” to you, it is far more likely that you have missed something than it is that the entire market has got it wrong and you are right. Still, with all that said, I believe there is one very popular energy stock that should be shorted at current levels…Bloom Energy (BE). If you are a regular reader and have a long memory, you might remember that seven months ago, in June of last year, I recommended buying Bloom. I said then that their on-site fuel cell type generators stood out from the competition for a few reasons, and that they would appeal to companies building server and data centers as an alternative to depending on America’s somewhat creaky electric grid. That opinion has obviously become more mainstream, based on what has happened to BE since I wrote that piece… Back then, BE was trading at around $20, a far cry from the $150 that it touched this week. I said in June that buying and holding the stock for a few years might be smart, but I really didn’t see it jumping this far, this fast. That has come as the company has consistently beaten estimates for everything: EPS, revenue, and growth. On that basis, and given the potential that is still there, the move up makes sense. However, looking at the numbers, it seems to have gone too far, too fast. Growth stocks often have high P/Es, but BE’s trailing multiple of just under 1,900 is way beyond high. I get it, they are growing, but not that quickly! For context, Amazon (AMZN), probably the ultimate growth stock that went on to dominate multiple industries and sectors, has a historical high P/E of 563 in December of 2015. The forward P/E looks a little more reasonable, at around 175, at least until you realize that that is after just about every analyst that covers the stock has scrambled to raise their estimates significantly. My overall view of BE’s prospects hasn’t changed that much since June, but do you really think that they will turn out to be three or four times more dominant or more profitable than Amazon on a comparative basis? I guess they could, but it is unlikely, to say the least. Even if they eventually do, that is a long way off, and current pricing suggests that it is imminent. This is a case of one stock becoming the poster child for a compelling investment theme…powering the AI transition and getting massively overbought as a result. So, having bought at just above $20 back in June, I am now selling, and not just squaring up my position. The move is so overdone that I am actively shorting BE as well, even though it goes against both my nature and my learned risk aversion. To access this exclusive content...
