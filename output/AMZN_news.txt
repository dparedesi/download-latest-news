Financial Planning for new year 2025 As 2025 gains momentum, you may be thinking about your investment portfolio. Where will the opportunities lie in the new year? As I’ve noted in the past, investors are once again faced with a landscape of opportunities and risks shaped by macroeconomic trends, evolving consumer behavior, and technological innovation—much of which has little to no historical precedent. While there are some solid stock options and interesting alternatives, looking farther afield for investment opportunities can be difficult. If you’re unsure what to do with your money in the months ahead, here are some high-level insights into where some of the most important industries stand and how they may fare in the upcoming year. The multifamily housing sector continues to show resilience, bolstered by strong demand for rental properties. “As the financial hurdles of buying a home persist and interest rates plateau, multifamily housing is emerging as the clear choice for many,” notes Chuck Bryant, Jr., COO of Roial Group, an investment firm focused on affordable multifamily housing. “This surge in rental demand, alongside strong economic conditions, highlight the enduring strength of multifamily investments.” “The U.S. faces a critical shortage of affordable rental housing,” Bryant emphasizes, “with only 33 units available for every 100 extremely low-income households.” Other data backs up this statistic. According to the National Multifamily Housing Council, the U.S. needs to build 4.3 million new apartments by 2035 to meet demand. This shortfall is driven by rising housing prices, a shift in consumer preferences toward renting, and demographic trends such as delayed homeownership among millennials and Gen Z. “This persistent gap,” says Bryant, “ensures steady demand, making affordable housing a stable and impactful investment opportunity for 2024 and beyond." For those who wish to have exposure to multifamily real estate without managing their own properties, multifamily real estate investment trusts could be a solution. For 2025, REITs are poised to benefit from a strong rental market, especially in high-demand urban and suburban areas. However, investors should stay up to date on other factors. Rising interest rates, for instance, could pose challenges for new developments, increasing borrowing costs and potentially slowing construction activity. Technology remains a cornerstone of modern portfolios, with artificial intelligence and cloud computing serving as key growth drivers. Gartner estimates that global spending on AI systems will explode over the next few years, growing at around 19.1% annually through 2027. Companies like Nvidia, which dominates the AI chip market, and Microsoft, a leader in cloud services, are at the forefront of this transformation. They remain solid investment options as this initial AI investment run plays out in the coming years. The semiconductor industry is another area to watch. The CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 has incentivized domestic semiconductor production, reducing reliance on foreign suppliers. This move is expected to bolster companies like Intel and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. However, investors should remain cautious about valuations. The tech-heavy NASDAQ index has rebounded significantly in 2024, leading to concerns about overvaluation. Don’t overcommit here. The energy sector presents a mixed outlook, with oil and gas facing headwinds and alternative energy gaining momentum. On the traditional side, the International Energy Agency predicts that global oil demand will plateau by 2030, but short-term disruptions could drive prices higher in 2025. Geopolitical tensions and production cuts by OPEC+ have already led to price spikes in 2024, creating opportunities for companies like ExxonMobil and Chevron. Alternative energy, however, is where growth potential truly lies. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 allocated $369 billion toward clean energy projects, sparking a surge in investment. Solar power alone is expected to account for 30% of U.S. electricity generation by 2030, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. “The ‘electrification of everything’ is more than just the most important macro tailwind for renewables,” says Glenn Jacobson, Managing Partner at Greenbelt Capital, a private equity leader in the energy sector. “It’s reshaping the entire energy landscape, as well as the computer, transportation, and industrial sectors. This shift represents a massive structural transformation, driving unprecedented demand for clean, reliable, and scalable energy solutions.” Jacobson narrows his prediction to a combination of production and growth, saying, “I’m most bullish on solar and solar-plus-storage, both at the grid-scale and distributed levels, due to their unmatched economics. However, we’re set to see broad-based capacity growth across multiple energy sources. This expansion will go hand-in-hand with massive grid infrastructure investments as the market adjusts to a generational surge in both energy supply and electricity demand.” Solar has been a long-term investment option for years. Don’t expect it to lose its luster in 2025. The retail sector is navigating a complex environment characterized by shifting consumer preferences and economic pressures. E-commerce continues to expand, with online sales projected to grow by 8.6% in 2025, according to Oberlo. Amazon (AMZN) and Shopify (SHOP) remain dominant players. However, niche platforms catering to specific demographics are also gaining traction. Brick-and-mortar retail, on the other hand, is undergoing a transformation. Experiential retail, which focuses on creating unique in-store experiences, is gaining popularity. Companies like Lululemon (LULU) and RH (formerly Restoration Hardware) have embraced this trend and delivered strong financial performance. However, like real estate interest rates, inflation poses a significant challenge for the retail sector. Rising costs for goods and services could dampen consumer spending, particularly in discretionary categories. Retailers with robust pricing power and strong brand loyalty are better equipped to navigate this environment. The healthcare sector remains a front-line area of innovation. It continues to offer a compelling case for long-term investment driven by demographic trends and technological advancements. The aging global population is increasing the demand for healthcare services, while breakthroughs in biotechnology and medical devices are creating new opportunities. Pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer (PFE) and Moderna (MRNA) continue to invest in vaccine development and gene therapies. Meanwhile, medical device companies such as Medtronic (MDT) and Boston Scientific (BSX) are innovating in areas like minimally invasive surgery and cardiovascular health. Healthcare REITs, which focus on properties like senior living facilities and medical offices, also present a stable investment option. With a projected annual growth rate of 5.6% per year for healthcare expenditures through 2032, according to data shared by Becker’s Hospital CFO Report, the sector is poised for sustained growth. Investing may be an old concept, but it’s never looked like it does right now. Technology, economics, culture, politics, globalization, and countless other elements are influencing the investment landscape like never before. It’s important to consider where your money should go in 2025, and the real estate, tech, energy, retail, and healthcare sectors remain leading options for the months ahead. One Community.

Title: Stocks are priced for 'perfection' and more vulnerable to a correction, Goldman warns

A perfect money-making market backdrop may not continue for much longer as investors digest rising bond yields, bloated valuations, and uncertainty over further interest rate cuts. That was a fresh warning on Thursday from Goldman Sachs. "The powerful rally in equity prices in recent months leaves equities priced for perfection," Goldman Sachs strategist Peter Oppenheimer wrote in a note to clients. "While we expect equity markets to make further progress over the year as a whole — largely driven by earnings — they are increasingly vulnerable to a correction driven either by further rises in bond yields and/or disappointments on growth in economic data or earnings." Although Oppenheimer stopped short of predicting a near-term correction (loosely defined as a 10% pullback from a high) in stocks, he offered up three plausible reasons for investors to perhaps lighten up on risk in their portfolio right now. Read more: TD Ameritrade's former CEO makes his 2025 market prediction For starters, Oppenheimer pointed out that the speed of the recent rises in stock prices likely reflects much of the good news that Wall Street is expecting on growth in 2025. Concern that strong future growth is already reflected in valuations could be seen this week with market darling Nvidia (NVDA), a stock that has exploded 185% in the past year. Investors were left yearning for more from CEO Jensen Huang's closely watched CES keynote on Monday evening. In response, the stock on Tuesday notched its worst day since Sept. 3. Other richly valued momentum names such as Palantir (PLTR) and AMD (AMD) have sold off more than 10% in the past month as traders price in a more elevated interest rate backdrop — among other factors. "You could look at names like Palantir, Tesla, some of the sell-offs that we're seeing — I think broadly we're just going to see some white knuckles in the next six months," Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (see video above; listen below). "Trump headline risk, tariffs, 10-year Treasury as it goes to 5% and what does it mean for Fed [are all risks] — and so I think we're going to see some of that [volatility]. Oppenheimer also pointed out that high valuations for stocks are likely to limit forward returns. Goldman's research found that it's "extremely difficult" for companies to maintain high levels of sales and profit margins over sustained periods of time. Therefore, that sets the stage for investors to be let down by performance and opt to sell stocks. Stocks are also likely to face "stiff competition" from other assets (see bitcoin) during the next decade. Goldman estimated the S&P 500 (^GSPC) will have a total return of only 3% over the next decade. This return would rank in the seventh percentile of 10-year returns since 1930, Goldman's data shows. And lastly, Oppenheimer reasoned that "unusually high market concentration increases portfolio risks." The strategist is particularly concerned that the five biggest stocks in the US — Apple (AAPL), Nvidia, Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN) — make up about a quarter of the S&P 500. That concentration raises the prospect for a broader market correction if any of these companies disappoint in their results or trading conditions go risk off. Globalt Investments senior portfolio manager Keith Buchanan thinks that continued dominance of growth stocks could make the market more "top-heavy than it is." "If the economy doesn't hold up and consumer spending doesn't continue ... growth, in our opinion, is extremely vulnerable as the economic stress would hit those highest valuation names most certainly the quickest," Buchanan warned on Yahoo Finance's Catalysts. — Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

With a new Presidential administration set to take office in less than two weeks, there’s a feeling of change in the air. Some of the changes are already clear – President-elect Trump has made clear his intent to implement new tax policies, and his previous term in office has already shown that he favors pro-business, growth-oriented economic policies, along with economic deregulation. The combination promises to keep the good times rolling in the stock markets. Discover outperforming stocks and invest smarter with Top Smart Score Stocks Filter, analyze, and streamline your search for investment opportunities using Tipranks' Stock Screener Watching the situation from Wolfe Research, analyst Shweta Khajuria sees plenty of options for investors who aim to cash in on a rising tide. Sound consumer demand, lower interest rates, and low unemployment, in her view, will provide a broad base of support for the overall economy – and for her own preference, of internet stocks. “We remain opportunistic within the Internet sector. We expect fundamentals to remain stable with healthy top-line growth from penetration gains & product launches, ongoing margin expansion, and capital allocation efforts,” Khajuria opined. Getting into specifics, the 5-star analyst has selected Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) as two of the best internet stocks to buy right now. According to the TipRanks database, these ‘Magnificent 7’ stocks have also earned a ‘Strong Buy’ rating from the rest of the Street. Let’s dive into the details and take a closer look at each of them. Amazon The first stock we’ll look at, Amazon, is the world leader in e-commerce, and a fast-growing giant in both cloud computing and AI services. Amazon was founded in 1994 and has proven itself to be a survivor – the company lived through the dot-com bubble burst and has grown out of its origins as ‘the online bookseller’ to become the digital world’s one-stop shop. As the global e-commerce leader, Amazon boasts that it can deliver any product to any place, and it follows through. The result is a behemoth of a company, with a market cap of $2.39 trillion. Amazon’s online retail is its core business, and made up 83% of its total revenue in the third quarter of 2024, the last period reported. Of its $131.4 billion revenue haul, $95.5 billion came from the North America segment; $35.9 billion came from international sales. The company saw its highest year-over-year revenue growth in its cloud computing subscription service, AWS, which expanded 19% y/y to reach $27.5 billion. Amazon’s overall Q3 revenue came to $158.9 billion, up 11% from the prior year and beating the forecast by $1.6 billion. Amazon reported a free cash flow of $47.7 billion for the 12 months ending on September 30, 2024, up 123% year-over-year, and the company finished Q3 with more than $78 billion in cash and liquid assets on hand. What all of this means is that Amazon has deep pockets and plenty of resources to expand and modernize both its e-commerce and cloud computing activities. The company is doing just that and is making strong use of AI as it does so. On the retail activity side, Amazon is using AI to improve its customer interfaces. The company has introduced an AI-powered shopping assistant to smooth out the process of searching the retail database for exactly the right product at the right price, and already uses AI to improve its online advertising activities. On the cloud side, Amazon is integrating AI capabilities and tools into the AWS platform and is working with the AI development company Anthropic to build generative AI models for Bedrock, Amazon’s own AI cloud platform. In addition, Amazon, under the AWS aegis, is developing and releasing a family of semiconductor chips, Trainium, designed specifically to train AI and natural language systems. At the bottom line, all of this has made Amazon enormously profitable. The company realized earnings of $1.43 per share in 3Q24, a figure that was 29 cents better than the forecasts. In addition, Amazon’s stock is up 49% in the last 12 months, outperforming the NASDAQ’s 31% gain by a wide margin. Checking in with analyst Khajuria and the Wolfe view, we find her bullish on Amazon, specifically citing the company’s strengths. Khajuria writes, “We named AMZN as a top pick at the time of our launch in July ’24, and we continue to remain constructive on it based on our three-pronged thesis: i) Upside to retail margins driven by operational efficiency gains, automation, Ad revenue growth, and sustainable Int’l profitability; ii) Healthy, sustainable AWS revenue growth in the HT% range driven by demand for AI-based workloads and inference, Trainium chips, and Anthropic; iii) Ongoing market share consolidation driven by fast delivery speeds and availability of non-discretionary items.” Moving forward from this stance, Khajuria puts an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating on AMZN stock. This is complemented by a $270 price target that implies a one-year upside potential of 21%. (To watch Khajuria’s track record, click here) Overall, this mega-cap e-commerce giant has earned a Strong Buy consensus rating from the Street, based on 47 recent analyst reviews that show a lopsided split of 46 Buys to just 1 Hold. The shares are priced at $222.11 and their average target price of $249.62 suggests they will gain 12% in the year ahead. (See AMZN stock forecast) Meta Platforms The second stock we’ll look at here today is Meta Platforms, the global leader in social media and the parent company of Facebook, along with Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. Meta’s family of social apps had a collective DAP, or daily active people, of 3.29 billion in September 2024 – meaning that this company can effectively reach 41% of the world’s population. That’s a huge number, and it underscores just how effective Mark Zuckerberg’s company has been at building social media into a global force. Meta has used its unprecedented reach to support its revenue-generating activities, primarily digital advertising. The company’s huge audience gives it access to an enormous well of data, which can be used to fine-tune online advertising campaigns or simply sold to advertisers. In its last quarterly report, covering 3Q24, Meta reported an 11% year-over-year increase in the average price paid per ad on its platform. This solid metric helped push the company’s total revenue in the quarter to $40.59 billion, beating the forecast by $280 million while growing 19% year-over-year. Meta’s stock, like Amazon’s above, has outperformed the broader markets by a wide margin, gaining 73% in the last 12 months. That Meta is successful is beyond doubt. The company has achieved this success by adapting to changes in the digital landscape – some of those changes brought on by the very social media revolution that it helped to start. One good example is the company’s reaction to the strength of Twitter, or X, as owner Elon Musk has rebranded it. Meta developed its own threads-based app, appropriately dubbed Threads, which it launched in July 2023 as a competitor. While Threads has not yet reached the popularity of X, it has reached the milestone of 200 million active users. Meta also stands to gain from an Act of Congress which was upheld at the Federal appeals level last month. The act orders the Chinese company ByteDance to divest itself of the popular social video app TikTok – if it wants to keep the app available in the US. If the Chinese company does not comply, it risks having TikTok banned from US internet providers. While enforcement of such a ban would be difficult at best, the prospect of it may give a boost to Meta. Meta has developed several social video apps of its own (Reels and Stories on Facebook) and is strongly positioned to grab a large part of TikTok’s 170 million-strong audience should the Chinese app face a ban. The upshot to all of this is that, while Meta may be the ‘old man’ in the rapidly evolving social media world, it is hardly moribund. The company is smart and adaptable, and has proven itself capable of meeting changing conditions while realizing sound profits. Its 3Q24 earnings figure came to $6.03 per share, beating the forecast by 74 cents and growing 37% year-over-year. For Wolfe’s Khajuria, the key here is that Meta’s combination of social apps, its strength in video apps, and its ability to meet changing conditions make the company a ‘top pick.’ As she puts it, “We remain constructive despite the significant outperformance over the last two years given our view that Street estimates offer upside. Our thesis: i) We think video unification remains underappreciated based on our detailed analysis, we forecast upside to 2025 Street ests. by MSD $B; ii) We size Threads opportunity as potentially adding LSD $Bs with monetization starting in ’25; iii) TikTok divestiture remains uncertain, but should that happen, we see 8 to 10% upside to EPS; iv) Cleaner AI narrative as multi-year investments have better positioning to show ROIC potential.” Bottom line, Khajuria puts an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating on Meta, and backs that with a $730 price target, showing her confidence in a 16% upside potential over the next 12 months. Meta has 43 recent analyst reviews on file, and these break down to 39 Buys, 3 Holds, and 1 Sell. The shares are currently trading for $617.89 and the average target price of $683.72 implies a one-year potential gain of 10.5%.
