Earnings season continues this week, with notable economic releases for inflation and consumer ... [+] spending. However, with President Trump threatening reciprocal tariffs, fundamental data could take a backseat to politics. With almost two-thirds of the fourth-quarter earnings season complete, the pace slows slightly with 77 S&P 500 companies scheduled to report. 77% of S&P 500 firms reported better-than-expected earnings for the quarter. Two of the Magnificent 7 reported earnings last week, with only NVIDIA (NVDA) remaining on February 26. The Magnificent 7 consists of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA). S&P 500 Earnings Season Despite robust earnings growth and a noisy but solid jobs report, concerns about President Trump’s threatened additional tariffs and some worries about artificial intelligence (AI) spending caused some market consternation. The S&P 500 fell 0.2% for the week, but the Magnificent 7 lost 2.8%. Market Returns According to FactSet data, industrials, consumer discretionary, and healthcare contributed most significantly to last week's earnings growth improvement, while the industrials sector was the largest detractor. Uber Technologies (UBER) was the most significant contributor to industrials, with Amazon.com (AMZN) being the most critical contributor to the consumer discretionary sector. Within healthcare, earnings beats by Pfizer (PFE) and Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY) increased the earnings growth rate. The financial sector is expected to show the most rapid year-over-year growth rate in the S&P 500, followed by communications services and consumer discretionary. The energy sector is at the bottom, with a forecasted almost twenty-eight percent decline in year-over-year earnings. Estimated Earnings By Sector Sales growth is closely tied to nominal GDP growth, which combines after-inflation economic growth (real GDP) with inflation. At this point in the earnings season, sales growth at 5.2% exceeds expectations, with the tailwind from 5% year-over-year nominal GDP growth. Estimated Sales By Sales Due primarily to the robust earnings growth for financials, communication services, and consumer discretionary, the blended earnings performance has significantly outperformed expectations at the end of the quarter. Combining actual results with consensus estimates for companies yet to report, the blended earnings growth rate for the quarter is at +16.4% year-over-year, above the expectation of +11.9% at the end of the quarter. S&P 500 Earnings Summary Because these companies are a critical driver of earnings growth and a significant percentage of the S&P 500’s market capitalization, the Magnificent 7 are the group to watch this earnings season. Alphabet (GOOGL) and Amazon.com (AMZN) reported last week. While earnings growth was robust for both, it was below very high expectations, and the stocks were sent lower for the week. Separately, investors are questioning whether both companies' increased AI infrastructure spending will yield a good return on investment. Looking at Alphabet specifically, their cloud business revenue, including AI infrastructure demand, grew by 30% year-over-year, but that slowed from the 35% growth in the previous quarter. Notably, the company said capacity constraints, not demand, were the issue. The company expects to spend about $75 billion in 2025 on additional AI infrastructure, an increase of 43% over 2024. Aside from focusing on AI, Alphabet’s core businesses, search and YouTube, performed well in the quarter. NVIDIA (NVDA) is the final group member to report earnings, scheduled for February 26. The introduction of DeepSeek led to worries that demand for their AI chips might falter, so the stock had been down over 20% from its peak until last week’s 8% rally. Alphabet and Amazon announced significant increases in capital spending to meet AI capacity demands, which helped reduce worries that a decline in demand for NVIDIA’s chipsets could be imminent. Notable companies reporting this week are McDonald’s (MCD), Coca-Cola (KO), Humana (HUM), Kraft Heinz (KHC), Applied Materials (AMAT), and Airbnb (ABNB). Magnificent 7: Q4 Earnings Growth It was a noisy monthly jobs report on Friday. Nonfarm payrolls grew by 143,000 in January, which was below consensus. More recent months were revised higher but offset by downward revisions to farther out months. Both household employment measures are distorted by a much higher than typical adjustment for immigration-related adjustments. These adjustments also helped send the unemployment rate down to 4%. The workweek fell to a 5-year low of 34.1 hours, and hourly earnings rose more than expected. Though the government said that the numbers showed no impact from the L.A. fires and weather conditions, it seems likely that there was an impact, so it's best to take this month’s job data with a grain of salt. Monthly Job Growth Looking at other labor market data for some clarity, initial claims for unemployment benefits remain low, so there is no sign of a collapse in the job market. Initial Jobless Claims Given the mixed and noisy monthly jobs report, markets and the Federal Reserve (Fed) will wait for more straightforward data to make any decisions about the economy. The Fed is expected to be on the sidelines until mid-year when it might resume short-term interest rate cuts. Regarding the U.S. economy, the crucial releases will be Wednesday’s consumer inflation (CPI) and Friday’s retail sales numbers. CPI is expected to hold steady at an above-target 2.9% rate, but the details will be more critical with housing costs and services inflation closely watched. Retail sales are expected to slow from December’s rapid pace, but the U.S. consumer is the lifeblood of the economy. U.S. CPI Inflation Estimate Earnings season slows, but plenty of important companies are reporting this week. Fundamental data could take a backseat to politics. President Trump announced he would roll out reciprocal tariffs this week to match the levies other countries put on U.S. imports. Markets would probably see these as positive relative to the original thought of a 10-20% global tariff, but it would almost certainly add the European Union to the targeted regions. The duration of the higher tariffs, retaliatory action by impacted countries, the strength of the U.S. dollar, and the ability to switch to domestically produced or imports from non-impacted countries will impact any price increases or demand shocks caused by the tariffs, so the ultimate result is impossible to know. In any case, markets dislike uncertainty, so tariff news should add to volatility. Disclosure: Glenview Trust holds many stocks mentioned in this article within its recommended investment strategies.

Title: What's Happening With AMZN Stock?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/02/07/whats-happening-with-amzn-stock/

LAS VEGAS, USA - JANUARY 09: Logo of Amazon seen during the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2025 in ... [+] Las Vegas, Nevada, on January 9, 2025. (Photo by Artur Widak/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) surpassed street expectations from its fourth quarter performance, delivering revenue of $187.8 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $1.86 - topping analysts’ projections of $187.3 billion and $1.49, respectively. While Amazon Web Services remained a key growth driver, the company provided a cautious first-quarter forecast that could potentially pressure its stock price in the near term. Separately, after a good fourth quarter should you Buy, Sell, Or Hold LLY Stock At $870? AMZN stock, with 57% returns since the beginning of 2024, has outperformed the S&P 500 index, up 28%. The company’s substantial investments in rebuilding its infrastructure over recent years are now yielding results, which is evident from the improvement in operating profits. This has boded well for its stock. But, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. Amazon’s revenue of $187.8 billion in Q4 reflected a 10% y-o-y growth. Looking at segments, North America saw a 10% rise to $115.6 billion, International sales were up 8% to $43.4 billion, and AWS saw a 19% jump to $28.8 billion. Amazon also saw its operating margin expand by 350 bps y-o-y to 11.3% in Q4, thanks to an uptick in its high-margin AWS business. Higher revenues clubbed with margin expansion resulted in the bottom line of $1.86, up 86% y-o-y. Amazon’s first-quarter revenue guidance ranges between $151 billion and $155.5 billion, falling short of analysts’ expectations of $158.5 billion. This forecast includes an anticipated negative impact of $2.1 billion from unfavorable foreign exchange movements. Furthermore, the company raised its capital expenditures to $100 billion this year, reflecting its continued investments in AI. Amazon is focused on expanding its infrastructure to keep pace with the surging demand for generative AI services. Although Amazon posted an upbeat Q4, its stock is trading lower in after-hour trading amid a bleak Q1 outlook. Even if we look at a slightly longer period, the increase in AMZN stock over the last four-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last four-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts, impending tariff wars, and the rise of DeepSeek, could AMZN face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months — or will it see a strong jump? While we will soon update our model for Amazon, to reflect the latest results, we think its stock has little room for growth. At its current levels of around $230, AMZN is already trading at 3.9x trailing revenues, versus the stock’s average P/S ratio of 3.2x over the last five years. Investors have awarded Amazon a premium to its historical valuation multiple, reflecting the company’s enhanced profitability. In light of Amazon’s recent performance and future outlook, we see limited opportunity for its valuation multiple to expand further. Also, check out our note on What’s Happening With GOOG Stock?

Title: Amazon wants to spend $104 billion, and the stock gets clipped: What Wall Street is saying

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Amazing what some foreign-exchange fluctuations and eye-popping capital expenditures guidance will do to a large-cap tech stock. Amazon stock (AMZN) was clipped by 3% to $231.80 each in premarket trading on Friday after the tech giant delivered mixed first quarter guidance and promised big spending on AI infrastructure in 2025. The company's ticker page was the most active on the Yahoo Finance platform, ahead of retail investor favorite Palantir (PLTR), which has been on a post-earnings tear this week. Amazon guided to first quarter revenue of between $151 billion and $155 billion. Analysts were anticipating $158 billion, with the miss the function of a $2.1 billion expected hit from currency fluctuations. Similar to Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) this earnings season, Amazon uncorked a whopper of a capital spending guide. It sees $104 billion in capital expenditures this year, well above analyst forecasts of $80 billion to $85 billion. The Street has opted to stay bullish on Amazon after its results for two reasons, however. Most analysts have pointed to a sales reacceleration in the key Amazon Web Services cloud business later this year, amid the company's aggressive spending. Watch: How Salesforce's CEO is planning for the AI future "The shares have pulled back on the guidance and the fact that 2025 is likely an investment year, but we expect by second half 2025 this heavy capex investment + accelerating AI adoption (which we believe will also accelerate the move to the cloud) should begin to materially re-accelerate cloud revenue," Pivotal Research analyst Jeffrey Wlodarczak said in a client note. The other factor is that Amazon just had a good quarter. What stood out to Yahoo Finance: Three straight quarters of 19% sales growth for AWS. AWS operating profit margin of 46.9%, versus 29.6% a year ago. The second consecutive quarter of accelerated sales growth at Amazon's physical stores. Amazon delivered its highest quarterly operating income ever at $21.2 billion. Here are several of the best Wall Street insights on Amazon's quarter and outlook. Rating: Buy/Reiterated Price Target: $260/Reiterated "Amazon has a deep moat around their core businesses driven by their unmatched scale and appears to have numerous healthy organic revenue growth opportunities driven primarily by their high margin AWS cloud segment (which we expect to grow from 17% of revenue to ~35% in 5 years), extension of their e-commerce/fulfillment arms into new segments/internationally, continued rapid growth in their advertising business [already #3 in the world behind GOOG (BUY) and META (BUY)] and proven ability to develop new successful products/revenue streams leveraging their massive scale. This is all enhanced by what we believe is the potential to materially boost operating margins driven by scale, leveraging robotics/AI and benefits from an increasing % of revenue from high margin cloud computing/advertising combined with what appears to be an attractive valuation. AMZN remains on track at AWS and appears ahead of schedule on better monetization in its core retail/advertising/subscription businesses." Rating: Buy/Reiterated Price Target: $280/Previous: $235 "Commentary from management suggested that AWS is healthy with adoption across their services, whether they be AI-related or non-AI. Furthermore, it was noted that while it wasn't a huge impact, once AWS becomes less capacity constrained, they expect they'll be able to accelerate growth even more which they expect to occur in the back half of the year. We continue to believe that AWS is the best positioned of the three hyperscalers, as conversations with our DEN experts indicate that Amazon has quickly caught up and now surpassed Azure in AI-related services." Rating: Overweight/Reiterated Price Target: $270/Reiterated "Amazon views GenAI as the largest opportunity since cloud and the biggest tech shift since the Internet, w/virtually every app likely to infuse GenAI and most companies utilizing agents over time. Amazon views the $26.3B capex in 4Q as a reasonable representation of its 2025 capital investment rate, translating to about $105 billion in 2025 annual capex. The majority of spend will support growing need for tech infrastructure for demand across AI services, along w/support for North America and International. Amazon noted it only procures infrastructure given strong demand signals, which we view as bullish for AWS’ multi-year growth trajectory. In light of DeepSeek, CEO Andy Jassy believes the cost of inference will substantially come down over time. However, similar to cloud, where AWS cut prices 134 times between 2006-2023, Amazon believes lower inference costs will increase customers’ total spending as customers infuse applications w/inference and GenAI (i.e. Jevons Paradox). Like for Meta (META) and Alphabet (GOOG), heavy infrastructure investment should be a competitive advantage, and we believe the spending bodes well for multiple years of strong AWS revenue growth." Rating: Outperform/Reiterated Price Target: $280/Reiterated "We reiterate our Outperform rating and $280 price target and highlight possible catalysts in the intermediate-term, including (1) growing AI contributions to AWS growth as capacity constraints abate beginning in 2H25, (2) more meaningful improvements in cost to serve driven by deeper automation and robotics, (3) commercialization of AI capabilities in Alexa, (4) monetization of Project Kuiper which could begin late this year or in 1H26, and (5) an expected increase in Prime Subscription prices early next year."

Title: Temu and Shein's strategy to beat Trump's tariffs
URL: https://qz.com/temu-shein-amazon-trump-tariffs-china-retail-shipments-1851756879
Time Published: 2025-02-06T16:27:00Z
Full Content:
Chinese e-commerce giants Temu and Shein have been preparing to maintain their U.S. customer base following the end of the de minimis exemption. This rule, which allowed goods worth less than $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free, has played a key role in their rapid growth in the American market. But with President Donald Trump’s recent decision to suspend the provision, both companies are stepping up efforts to navigate new tariffs and customs rules. To reduce the impact of the changes, Temu has increased its focus on promoting items stored in U.S. warehouses, allowing it to bypass the tariffs that would have affected direct shipments from China. Shein has adopted a similar strategy, using warehouses in states like California and New Jersey. While this strategy may help them compete with Amazon, it also means both companies are working with less inventory. However, focusing on local inventory allows them to speed up delivery times – a critical advantage in the crowded e-commerce space. This has already paid off for Temu, with a significant portion of U.S. sales now coming from U.S.-based sellers. Temu had been exploring faster delivery options from local sellers even before the tariffs. Amazon (AMZN+1.59%), however, still leads the way in same-day and next-day delivery, with over nine billion items delivered in 2024. Shein, which has already been localizing its operations, has expanded its U.S. distribution centers. This shift enables Shein to fulfill orders from local stock, reducing its reliance on cross-border shipments while easing the impact of tariffs. The move also cuts down on delivery wait times, potentially boosting sales. However, Shein’s U.S. IPO plans are now uncertain as the company faces challenges, including concerns over its labor practices, which have delayed its public debut. The uncertainty surrounding cross-border shipments grew when the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) briefly stopped accepting packages from China, throwing a wrench in operations for companies like Temu and Amazon. The Postal Service quickly reversed course, allowing packages to be accepted once again. Still, the episode highlighted the volatility that Chinese e-commerce firms face as they navigate shifting customs requirements. For now, Temu and Shein’s strategies to go local signal that both companies have been preparing for these regulatory shifts and are taking steps to soften the impact. While critics argue that the de minimis exemption gave Chinese companies an unfair advantage, experts believe both Temu and Shein will continue to thrive. Santa Clara University Professor Kirthi Kalyanam told Business Insider that Shein’s success is driven by its manufacturing model, not its reliance on de minimis shipments. While the “tightening” of de minimis may remove any price advantage, Kalyanam believes Shein’s core strengths will remain intact.

Title: AI and the cloud in focus for Wall Street as analysts grow bullish ahead of earnings
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-q4-earnings-preview-aws-cloud-ai-holiday-consumers-analysts-2025-2
Time Published: 2025-02-05T19:14:28Z

Amazon said it will continue spending billions of dollars on AI infrastructure and signaled that it's not afraid of cheaper competitors during its call on Thursday. CFO Brian Olsavsky indicated that capital expenditures for 2025 could total just over $100 billion, with most of that going to AWS and Amazon's AI efforts, he said. He also pushed back on concerns about cheaper AI options, such as DeepSeek, saying that customers will keep spending on the technology. CEO Andy Jassy said that AWS could grow even faster, if it wasn't hindered by data center capacity constraints. Amazon is the latest Big Tech company to say it will continue investing in AI. Google, Meta, and Microsoft have all said that they'll keep investing billions to add capacity, even as pressure builds from investors to demonstrate returns on investment. Amazon's quarterly earnings beat Wall Street's estimates, but lighter-than-expected guidance weighed on the shares in after-market trading. Shares were trading over 4% lower after the company held its earnings call. The tech giant reported net sales of $187.79 billion, compared to estimates of $187.32 billion, while earnings per share came in at $1.86, compared to $1.50. Sales in its key Amazon Web Services cloud segment were slightly light at $28.79 billion compared to expectations of $28.82 billion. Guidance for the current first quarter was also lighter than anticipated, with revenue forecasts of between $151 billion to $155.5 billion, short of Wall Street's expectations of $158.64 billion. Amazon's stock closed 1% higher on Thursday. The shares are up almost 9% year-to-date, outpacing the S&P 500's 3% gain. Amazon's stock is trading 4.4% lower after-hours as the call ends. One analyst asks about UPS's decision to deliver fewer packages for Amazon. Jassy replied that UPS found some of Amazon's deliveries too low-profitability — similar to the reason UPS gave for downsizing its business with Amazon. Amazon built up its own logistics infrastructure during the pandemic, which meant it could carry more packages and saved money, Jassy said. That means that Amazon will be able to pick up the slack itself, he added. "We were impressed with what DeepSeek has done," Jassy said, including "some of the training techniques, primarily, and flipping the sequencing of reinforcement training, reinforcement learning being earlier without the human in the loop." He adds that there will be room for multiple different models, each good for a different purpose and that Amazon wants to provide as many options for customers as possible. Despite worries in recent weeks about cheaper models like DeepSeek, Jassy said that the cost of inference will fall — and that will be a good thing for tech companies. "Sometimes, people make the assumptions that if you're able to decrease the cost of any type of technology component, in this case, we're really talking about inference, that somehow it's going to lead to less total spend in technology," he said. "We have never seen that to be the case," Jassy added. The $26.3 billion that Amazon spent on capital expenditures in the fourth quarter — a run rate that will be "reasonably representative of our 2025 capital investment rate," CFO Olsavsky said. Doing the math, that would be about $105 billion in spending for 2025. The "vast majority" of capex is on AI and AWS, execs said. Like 2024, most of that spending will "support demand for our AI services, as well as tech infrastructure to support our North America and international segments," he adds. Amazon's shares are trading more than 5% down after the remarks. Amazon CEO Jassy references the latest Trainium chips, saying that "most AI computing has been driven by Nvidia chips, and we obviously have a deep partnership with Nvidia and will for as long as we can see into the future." "However, there aren't that many generative AI applications of large scale yet, and when you get there, like we have with apps like Alexa and Rufus, cost can get steep quickly," he said. CEO Andy Jassy, CFO Brian Olsavsky, and head of investor relations Dave Fildes are on the call. Growth at AWS "did not accelerate as anticipated and instead matched Q3 levels, indicating that the company is challenged by the same types of capacity constraints facing rivals Google and Microsoft," Sky Canaves, principal analyst at EMARKETER, a sister company of Business Insider, said. A brighter spot during the quarter was Amazon's holiday sales performance, which Canaves called "relatively strong for US retail." "We estimate that Amazon accounted for nearly half of US e-commerce growth during the holidays, and will gain share of overall online sales over the course of 2025, especially as low-cost rivals like Temu and Shein will be more heavily impacted by recent tariff developments," Canaves said. Analysts will be listening for any guidance about Amazon's planned spending on AI this year. It seemed to have an initial response in its earnings press release, saying benefits from AWS innovation are "often realized by customers (and the business) several months down the road, but these are substantial enablers in this emerging technology environment and we're excited to see what customers build." Other big tech names have indicated that they are willing to spend on AI so far this earnings season. Google parent company Alphabet said this week that its capital expenditures will reach $75 billion for 2025. Meta is planning to spend $60 billion to $65 billion for the year, it said last month. And Microsoft expects that spending, mostly on AI data centers, will amount to $80 billion for the year. Haul, Amazon's answer to low-price shopping sites like Temu and AliExpress, got a shoutout in the earnings press release as a "new shopping experience" launched during the fourth quarter. Amazon launched Haul in November. Like Temu, its products ship to customers directly from China and cost less than $20. The model relies on a de minimis exemption that was the target of an executive order from President Donald Trump earlier this month. 4th quarter Net sales $187.79 billion, +10% y/y, estimate $187.32 billion Operating income $21.20 billion, +61% y/y, estimate $18.84 billion Source: Bloomberg Consumer strength and rising demand for AI should put Amazon ahead of consensus expectations, Deutsche Bank said. The industry's growing embrace of Amazon's cloud service means that AWS could contribute to Amazon's expected operating income beat of $21 billion. "These trends alone (accelerating AWS revenue and a measured stance to headcount growth) should support at least $1bn of OI upside relative to the Street in the 4Q, to say nothing of the upside that should flow through the global e-commerce business," the bank said. Although Amazon may face stiffer headwinds from a strengthening dollar, operating income estimates should still rise higher after the earnings report. Deutsche Bank has a $275 price target on Amazon, about 15% higher than current levels. Amazon stands to gain from what looks to be an improving consumer backdrop, Mizuho said. Fourth-quarter ad-spend growth and price improvements across discretionary and staple products are displaying positive trajectories. "With that in mind, we feel good about the ecommerce revenue growth in 4Q24 and more importantly, the expected margin leverage from inbound logistics," the note said. The outperformance of AWS cloud service, retail margin expansions, and capital efficiencies add to Amazon's favorable risk/reward proposition, the analysts said. Mizuho has an "Outperform" rating on Amazon stock and holds a price target of $285, 20% higher than current levels. Wedbush Securities projects that the e-commerce giant will earn $20.7 billion in fourth-quarter operating income, outpacing initial 2024 expectations by more than 40%. This "exceptional" year of profit growth will repeat in 2025, and Wedbush sees full-year operating income beating consensus by 5%. Investors are too conservative about the firm's margin potential, given needless concern about the rising AI and satellite costs, as well as Amazon's decision to not increase Fulfillment fees. "We believe there is upside to expectations for 4Q results and 1Q guidance given the strength of the underlying retail environment, continued fulfillment optimization, improvements in international retail margin, and an ongoing mix shift to higher-margin AWS and advertising revenue," analysts wrote. Wedbush maintains an "Outperform" rating on Amazon. It increased its price target to $280, implying an 18% gain from current levels. Morgan Stanley equity analyst Brian Nowak is bullish on Amazon over its latest advances in warehouse robotics, making it an underappreciated AI winner in retail. For every 10% of units passing through robotic-enabled warehouses by 2030, Amazon could unlock up to $3 billion in annual recurring savings. "Early signals are promising too, with Amazon's latest fulfillment center in Shreveport, LA (opened in September 2024 as the first fulfillment center bringing together the full fleet of its latest robotics innovations), delivering 25% lower 'cost-to-serve' (fulfillment cost) during peak periods," Nowak wrote. Fulfillment costs make up nearly 20% of retail revenue, he added, making automation a serious long-term positive Morgan Stanley holds an "Overweight" rating on Amazon and a $280 price target, indicating 18% upside from current levels. Amazon should deliver a solid fourth-quarter report, as holiday-boosted retail growth will deliver an above-consensus operating profit of $19.7 billion. The firm's AWS cloud platform will likely meet expectations for 19% to 20% growth, BofA said, thanks to rising AI contributions. Drivers to cloud demand include, "Amazon's growing partnership with Anthropic, new competitive AI offerings (including Nova models and lower infrastructure costs on Trainium), and ramping GPU supply (greater Nvidia chip supply as well as the launch of Nvidia's Blackwell chips & cloud products)." But there are risks moving forward. The bank lowered its first-quarter revenue amid tariff and currency headwinds and cited that AWS margins may have peaked in 2024 amid favorable demand. BofA maintains a "Buy" rating on Amazon and a price objective of $255, or 8% above the firm's current share price. 4th quarter Net sales estimate: $187.32 billion Operating income estimate: $18.84 billion 1st quarter (Source: Bloomberg data) Jump to

Amazon (AMZN+1.59%) is set to report fourth-quarter earnings after the bell on Thursday, and expectations are high. Analysts predict strong results for the e-commerce giant, driven by growth in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud business, contributions from AI, and a “well-managed” holiday season. Bank of America (BAC-1.64%) is forecasting revenue of $187.24 billion, about $1.53 per share, for the fourth quarter, just shy of Wall Street’s consensus of $187.31 billion in revenue, approximately $1.47 per share. Analyst Justin Post noted robust fourth-quarter retail data, with Amazon’s core e-commerce business performing well. AWS, in particular, is expected to grow by 19% and 20%, boosted by AI, which the company uses to manage operations, provide entertainment, and assist online shoppers. Looking ahead, Bank of America also predicts that Amazon will provide first-quarter sales guidance between $152.25 billion and $158.25 billion, which is slightly below market expectations of $158.7 billion. Despite this, BofA maintains a buy rating on Amazon’s stock, with a price target of $255, citing the company’s strong profit growth and AI positioning. Amazon shares have increased roughly 5.8% in the previous month, reflecting investing optimism ahead of the earnings report. Beyond earnings, Amazon is navigating other challenges, including looming tariffs on Chinese imports from President Donald Trump. While these tariffs could disrupt e-commerce rivals like Temu and Shein, Amazon is in a strong position. With its established U.S. infrastructure, faster shipping capabilities, and fewer-tariff related hurdles, Amazon is well-positioned to absorb those types of cost increases. To compete with the Chinese fast-fashion giants, Amazon launched ultra-cheap platform Haul in Nov. 2024. Despite struggles in its physical stores, Amazon’s delivery network continues to excel. In 2024, the company set new delivery speed records, with over 9 billion items arriving the same or next day globally. U.S Prime members saved an estimated $95 billion on free shipping last year, with an average customer saving over $500 in delivery fees. As Amazon prepares to report earnings, all eyes will be on how its growth stacks up against Google’s (GOOGL+0.74%), which recently failed to woo Wall Street. As one of the nation’s largest employers, with a market cap of $2.5 trillion, the tech behemoth’s ability to maintain its leadership in cloud services and delivery – and sustain its dominance in e-commerce – remains to be seen.
