Microsoft (MSFT) stock just clocked an intraday record on Thursday ($468.49), a milestone that caps off the company’s aggressive AI moves — and even more aggressive expectations. Wall Street isn’t just rewarding Microsoft for showing up to the AI race, it’s pricing in a future where the company leads the pack. The surge marks the company’s biggest high since July 2024 and follows a series of announcements that signal how deeply AI is baked into Microsoft’s business. Recently, the company has laid out a massive infrastructure plan, unveiled custom AI chips for Azure, and kept investors buzzing with sharp revenue growth across its cloud and productivity divisions. In many ways, Microsoft’s stock high isn’t just about AI — it’s about the company’s ability to industrialize it. The AI narrative isn’t new, but Microsoft is increasingly making it look real. While Google (GOOGL) is experimenting and Amazon (AMZN) is largely building behind the scenes, Microsoft is out there productizing — and monetizing — faster than most expected. GitHub Copilot is gaining traction. Microsoft 365 is increasingly AI-native. Azure has become the go-to cloud for businesses that want ready-to-go AI tools. Microsoft had a rocky start to the year (a 10% decline from its July 2024 peak) but it’s rebounded sharply, thanks largely to strong cloud growth — Azure revenue jumped 33% in the 2025 fiscal third quarter — and continued momentum in AI integration. Now, Microsoft’s stock is up about 12% year-to-date (and 30% since April of this year), easily outperforming fellow tech giants such as Apple (AAPL), Amazon, Alphabet, and Nvidia (NVDA). The recent rally has added over $800 billion to Microsoft’s market capitalization, and the company’s performance positions it as one of the more stable, high-conviction bets in a tech sector that is increasingly divided between hype and execution. Earlier this year, Microsoft committed to spending $80 billion in fiscal 2025 — most of it on AI-enabled data centers. That’s a figure that suggests CEO Satya Nadella sees AI as Microsoft’s cloud moment all over again. And the market seems to agree. Behind the rally, analysts are circling with revised playbooks. The average analyst price target shows almost double-digit potential over the coming year. And some analysts predict that Microsoft’s AI initiatives could bring in over $10 billion annually.

Title: Investors Might Need A Waste Bag For Freshpet’s Stock

ByDavid Trainer ByDavid Trainer, Contributor. Pet food is displayed in a refrigerated cases at the Freshpet Inc. production facility in Bethlehem, ... More Pennsylvania, U.S., on Monday, Nov. 9, 2015. Freshpet produces the only industrial refrigerated pet food on the market, which is made with only fresh ingredients and eschews preservatives. Sales of premium dog food have surged 45 percent to $10.5 billion in the U.S. since 2009 and now account for more than half of the market. Photographer: Chris Goodney/Bloomberg I originally put Freshpet Inc. (FRPT) in the Danger Zone on February 2, 2022 and most recently reiterated my bearish opinion on the stock in October 17, 2022. Despite falling 45% YTD, I’m here to remind you: this stock remains dangerous. Figure 1: Freshpet Outperformance as a Short From 2/3/22 Through 5/9/25 FRPT Performance as Danger Zone Pick Freshpet has successfully grown its retail presence and increased its total store count (stores that sell Freshpet products) by 380 from the end of 4Q24 to the end of 1Q25. Similarly, the company’s revenue increased 18% YoY in 1Q25, mainly driven by volume gains of 15% and favorable price/mix of 3%. Additionally, Freshpet’s adjusted EBITDA increased from $31 million in 1Q24 to $36 million in 1Q25, though I show below why this metric is misleading. Retail improvements and top-line growth aside, Freshpet’s fundamentals remain in very poor shape. The company missed earnings estimates in its 1Q25 report and lowered full-year adjusted EBITDA guidance to the range of $190-$210 million, compared to prior guidance of “at least $210 million”. Freshpet’s management provides a misleading view of the company’s profitability when it directs investors to its “Adjusted” EBITDA. From 2019 to the TTM, Freshpet’s Adjusted EBITDA improved from $29 million to $167 million, while its GAAP net income rose from -$1 million to $16 million. Over the same time, the company’s economic earnings, the true cash flows of the business, fell from -$11 million to -$88 million. It is a big red flag when the company’s preferred non-GAAP metric is rising while its economic earnings are declining, or even worse, when its GAAP net income gets outpaced as well. The discrepancy between the metrics comes largely from the company removing $8.8 million in non-cash share-based compensation when calculating 1Q25 adjusted EBITDA. For reference, Freshpet’s 1Q25 GAAP net income was -$13 million. The discrepancy should come as no surprise as Freshpet openly admits in earnings releases that “the non-GAAP measures are not and should not be considered an alternative to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measures”. Figure 2: Freshpet’s Adjusted EBITDA vs. Net Income vs. Economic Earnings: 2019 – TTM FRPT Misleading Earnings 2019-TTM Freshpet’s total operating expenses, which include cost of goods sold and selling, general, and administrative expenses have remained high for years. For instance, over the last five years, total operating expenses averaged 106% of revenue. More recently, Freshpet’s total operating expenses rose from 96% of revenue in 1Q24 to 104% of revenue in 1Q25. The increase was driven by SG&A expenses rising from 36% of revenue to 44% of revenue over the same time. Considering the company’s high operating costs, it should come as no surprise that Freshpet has been and continues to burn cash. Freshpet’s free cash flow (FCF) has been negative on an annual basis every year in my model (dating back to 2017). On a quarterly basis, Freshpet’s FCF has been negative in 34 of the 36 quarters in my model. The only two quarters with positive FCF occurred in 4Q16 and 2Q18. From 2019 through 1Q25, Freshpet has burned through a cumulative $1.2 billion (29% of enterprise value) in FCF excluding acquisitions. See Figure 3. Figure 3: Freshpet’s Cumulative Free Cash Flow Since 2019 FRPT FCF Burn 2019-1Q25 Despite its cash burn rate, I did not make Freshpet a Zombie Stock because its cash on hand can support its TTM cash burn rate for 34 months (more than the 24 months cut off) from the end of May 2025. Note that Freshpet was a Zombie Stock before Jana Partners, in 4Q22, took a 10% stake in Freshpet and boosted the company’s cash on hand enough to extend its cash burn runway past 24 months. Jana Partners exited its position in Fresphet in 2Q24. Consequently, FRPT is at risk of going back on the Zombie Stock list should its cash burn runway fall below 24 months. Freshpet faces direct competition from both larger companies like Nestle (NSRGY), Mars Inc., General Mills (GIS), Colgate-Palmolive (CL), and Chewy (CHWY), as well as smaller, lesser-known start-ups. Additionally, the company faces heavy competition from private label pet food brands. In the most recently available comparable public data (Mars is privately owned and doesn’t disclose pet business sales every year), the pet food market was dominated by Nestle and Mars. In 2023, Nestle (32%) and Mars (29%) combined to make up 61% of the global pet food market. Hill’s Pet Nutrition (owned by Colgate-Palmolive) General Mills (GIS), The J.M. Smucker Company (SJM), rounded out the top five. Freshpet held just over 1% market share. See Figure 4. Figure 4: Freshpet’s Market Share Compared to Peers FRPT Market Share 2023 Importantly, these companies have significant competitive advantages in the form of larger manufacturing scale, a more extensive distribution network, and other business lines that generate cash to re-invest in the business. If I analyze estimated market share based on Freshpet’s 2024 sales and the estimated pet food market size in 2024, I find that the company holds just 1% of the estimated market. Competitors also include general retailers, such as Walmart (WMT), Costco (COST), and Amazon (AMZN), each of which sell their own private label pet brands. Freshpet not only lags the competition in market share, but also in profitability. Even though Freshpet achieved a record net operating profit after-tax (NOPAT) of $50 million in 2024, profits have fallen to -$10 million in 1Q25, down from $9 million in 1Q24. Similarly, the company’s return on invested capital (ROIC) hit a peak of 4% in 2024, but has fallen to 2% in the TTM ending 1Q25. Per Figure 5, Freshpet has the lowest ROIC and one of the lowest NOPAT margins in the industry. Figure 5: Freshpet’s Profitability Vs. Peers: TTM FRPT Profitability vs. Peers Taking market share in an industry already dominated by larger and more profitable companies will be hard to do, especially considering that Freshpet’s revenue is entirely undiversified or 100% dependent on its pet food sales. Below, I use my reverse discounted cash flow (DCF) model to analyze the future cash flow expectations baked into Freshpet’s stock price. Freshpet’s stock is priced as if it will grow profits at accelerated rates while also taking huge chunks of market share. I also present additional DCF scenarios to highlight the downside risk in the stock if Freshpet fails to achieve these overly optimistic expectations. To justify its current price of ~$80/share, my model shows Freshpet would have to: In this scenario, Freshpet would generate $11.7 billion in sales in 2034, which is 12x its TTM sales, 3x Colgate-Palmolive’s TTM pet food sales, and 5x General Mill’s pet food sales. This scenario also implies Freshpet’s NOPAT would reach $608 million in 2034, compared to the company’s all-time high NOPAT of $50 million and TTM NOPAT of $30 million. The implied sales in this scenario equate to 7% of the forecasted global pet food market in 2034, which is far above the company’s estimated 1% market share in 2024. Furthermore, companies that grow revenue by 20%+ compounded annually for such a long period are “unbelievably rare”, making the expectations in Freshpet’s share price even more unrealistic. If we, instead, assume Freshpet: the stock would be worth $49/share today – a 40% downside to the current price. In this scenario, Freshpet would grow sales to $7.2 billion in 2034, which would be around 8x the company’s TTM sales, 2x Colgate-Palmolive’s TTM pet food sales, and 3x General Mill’s pet food sales. The implied sales in this second scenario would represent 4% of the pet foods market in 2034, which is 4x the company’s market share in 2024. If I instead assume Freshpet: the stock would be worth just $26/share today – a 68% downside to the current price. The implied sales in this scenario would still represent 3% of the projected global pet foods market in 2034. Figure 6 compares Freshpet’s implied future revenue in these scenarios to its historical revenue. For comparison, I include the TTM pet food sales of peers Colgate-Palmolive (CL) and General Mills (GIS). Figure 6: Freshpet’s Historical and Implied Revenue: DCF Valuation Scenarios FRPT DCF Implied NOPAT Scenarios Each of the above scenarios assumes Freshpet grows revenue, NOPAT and FCF without increasing working capital or fixed assets. This assumption is highly unlikely but allows me to create best-case scenarios that highlight the unrealistically high expectations embedded in the current valuation. For reference, Freshpet’s invested capital grew 43% compounded annually from 2019 through the TTM. If I assume Freshpet’s invested capital increases at a similar rate in the DCF scenarios above, the downside risk is even larger. Given that the performance required to justify its current price is overly optimistic, I dig deeper to see if Freshpet is worth buying at any price. The answer is likely no. The company has $477 million in total debt, $42 million in outstanding employee stock options, and just $226 million excess cash. Freshpet has an economic book value, or no-growth value, of <$1/share. In other words, I do not think equity investors will ever see anywhere close to the level of economic earnings required to justify anything more than $1/share under normal operations.

Title: Time To Buy AMZN Stock?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. A view of the Amazon warehouse in Pawlikowice, Poland on May 29, 2025. (Photo by Jakub ... More Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is really leaning into AI, recently announcing a massive $10 billion investment in new data centers in North Carolina. Like Google and Microsoft, Amazon has been a major player in the AI boom, spending a whopping $222 billion on capital expenditures since 2022. The stock has seen a nice jump lately, climbing 24% from around $167 on April 21 to $208 now. This rally seems to be fueled by the broader market’s positive reaction to new trade deals and a pause on reciprocal tariffs between the U.S. and China. The probability of the U.S. economy going into a recession this year has also come down from 60% earlier to 40% now, according to J.P. Morgan Research. Given the change in overall market sentiment, you might be wondering if Amazon is still a smart investment after its recent climb. We believe it is. Even with the recent rally, Amazon shows strong operational growth and solid financial health, and its stock isn't overpriced. Our analysis dives deep into Amazon’s investment potential by looking at its current valuation compared to its recent operating performance and overall financial health. We’ve assessed Amazon across key areas like Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience. Our findings show that Amazon has a strong operating performance and financial condition. That said, if you seek upside with lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio presents an alternative - having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Separately, see – RGTI Stock: What’s Next After An 1,100% Rally? When we look at AMZN stock against the broader market, it seems pretty reasonable. Amazon’s price-to-sales ratio is 3.4 times, which is pretty close to the S&P 500’s 3.0 times. Its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 33.3 times is higher than the market’s 26.4 times, but its price-to-free cash flow ratio is 19.3 times, which is slightly better than the S&P 500’s 20.5 times. This means Amazon is doing a good job generating cash compared to its price. Check out our dashboard on Amazon’s Valuation Ratios for more details. This moderate valuation suggests that Amazon isn't really getting a premium for its growth potential right now. It's likely that those high capital expenditures we mentioned earlier have made some investors a bit nervous. While that higher P/E ratio signals that the market expects Amazon's earnings to keep growing, it also means the stock could be vulnerable if that growth slows down. However, it's worth noting that this 33x P/E is actually lower than Amazon's average P/E of 46x over the past two years. Amazon’s revenue just keeps climbing, showing how good they are at expanding across all their different businesses. Over the last three years, their annual revenue has grown by an average of 11%, much better than the S&P 500’s 5.5%. This strong performance continued in the past year, with revenues jumping 10.1% from $591 billion to $650 billion. Looking at their most recent quarterly results, things are still looking good. Revenues grew 8.6% to $156 billion compared to $143 billion in the same period last year. This consistent growth, whether we're looking at annual or quarterly numbers, really highlights how Amazon's diverse business model keeps them expanding, even as they get bigger and bigger. While Amazon’s revenues are trending higher, its profitability tells a slightly different story, and it might explain why some investors are a bit hesitant. For instance, their operating margin is 11.0%, which is a bit lower than the S&P 500's average of 13.2%. This suggests they're facing some challenges in turning all that revenue into efficient operations. Similarly, Amazon's net income margin of 10.1% also lags behind the broader market's 11.6% average. However, Amazon’s operating cash flow margin is 17.5%, actually beating the S&P 500’s 14.9%. This means they’re doing a great job at generating cash, even if their accounting profits seem lower. This difference often comes down to Amazon’s huge investments in growth and infrastructure. These investments might hit the company’s short-term profit margins, but they’re setting it up for bigger growth down the road. Amazon’s balance sheet is incredibly strong, giving them a really solid base to handle any economic bumps in the road. The company’s debt-to-equity ratio is super low at just 6.1%, which is way better than the S&P 500’s average of 19.9%. This conservative approach means Amazon has tons of financial wiggle room for big investments. They’re also sitting on a good amount of cash. Cash and cash equivalents make up 14.7% of their total assets, slightly more than the broader market’s 13.8%. With $95 billion in cash and $643 billion in total assets, Amazon has serious resources to chase new growth opportunities and ride out any tough times. Looking back at how Amazon's stock performed during past market downturns gives us some good insights. It shows they can be pretty resilient, but also quite volatile. During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Amazon actually held up pretty well. Their stock only dropped 22.7% compared to the S&P 500's 33.9% plunge, and it bounced back to pre-crisis levels in just two months. However, things were a bit different during the 2022 inflation shock. Amazon's stock took a bigger hit, falling 56.1% while the market dropped 25.4%. It took almost two years for the stock to fully recover, which just goes to show how growth stocks can feel more pain when interest rates go up and valuations get squeezed. The 2008 financial crisis presented similar challenges, with Amazon declining 65.3% against the market's 56.8% drop, though it also recovered within two years. These patterns suggest that while Amazon tends to swing more during severe market stress, it typically has the underlying strength to bounce back over time. We believe Amazon is an attractive investment right now. It offers a good valuation combined with incredibly strong fundamentals and a solid financial position. The company is delivering double-digit revenue growth and boasts a fortress-like balance sheet. These strengths outweigh any minor concerns about profitability. Notably, Amazon’s AWS segment is far more profitable, boasting estimated EBITDA margins of around 45% last year, than its other businesses, which have EBITDA margins under 15%. With AWS's contribution to the company's overall sales on the rise—up from 12% in 2021 to 17% last year—the overall profitability will also improve. Furthermore, with a proven ability to recover from downturns, Amazon provides an excellent entry point into the long-term growth trends of the ongoing AI boom. It’s a strong addition for growth-oriented portfolios. However, it’s important to consider the potential risks. Amazon’s growth could slow down, and it might underperform during times of economic uncertainty. There’s also the question of whether its significant investments in AI will pay off. You should definitely weigh these risks. Not too happy about the volatile nature of AMZN stock? The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
