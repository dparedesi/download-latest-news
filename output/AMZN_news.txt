US stock markets opened Friday on a turbulent note as investors weighed strong corporate moves against persistent inflation pressures. The Dow Jones Industrial Average hit a record intraday high of 45,203.52, fueled by gains in healthcare stocks. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite slipped to 21,710.67, dragged down by profit-taking in tech and cautious semiconductor forecasts. The spotlight was on UnitedHealth (UNH), which jumped over 11% after Warren Buffett’s $1.57 billion stake was disclosed, signaling renewed investor confidence. Traders also digested July’s 0.9% jump in the Producer Price Index (PPI), keeping Treasury yields elevated and adding pressure on growth-oriented stocks.

Title: Target Reports Earnings Next Week. Investors Are Wary—or Worse—About Its Stock.

Can Target turn it around? That's the big question ahead of Wednesday morning, when the big retailer is set to report its latest financial results. Those numbers, along with whatever the company says about its outlook and the state of its business, could go a long way toward restoring investor confidence in a stock that's lost nearly one-quarter of its value this year while Walmart (WMT) has posted a double-digit advance. There's a simple enough reason investors have been cautious around Target's (TGT) stock, which fell in the wake of its first-quarter earnings report and has since crept gently higher. Executives in May clipped the company's outlook for 2025, setting investors up to expect declining sales and lower earnings per share than previously forecast. Wall Street is looking for revenue and adjusted net income to fall year-over-year in the second quarter, according to Visible Alpha data, with same-store sales also seen declining. One measure of the wariness out there: As of today, there's a sell-side analyst with a full-on bearish take on the stock. Bank of America on Friday downgraded the shares to "underperform"—the only such rating tracked by Visible Alpha—and a $93 price target more than 10 bucks below Thursday's close. The wider picture shows a number of analysts with neutral ratings on the stock, though a few still hold bullish ratings. Oppenheimer analysts on Friday suggested buying dips, as "volatile trading could continue until comps return to positive territory." Visible Alpha's consensus target around $104 in line with the stock's finish yesterday. Bank of America analysts said they're less concerned with next week's results than the broader story, citing worries about digital sales, the state of Target's digital advertising and third-party marketplace, and tariff concerns. They also pointed to competitive pressure from Walmart, which reports its own results on Thursday, and Amazon (AMZN), which this week pushed further into the grocery business. "Target's longer-term outlook," they wrote, "is becoming more uncertain."

Title: Capital Spending As The Key Market Driver?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/randywatts/2025/08/14/capital-spending-as-the-key-market-driver/

ByRandy Watts ByRandy Watts, Contributor. In 2025, the U.S. economy has continued to chug along despite the headwinds of tariffs and trade dislocations, as well as the current war in Ukraine and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. One of the sources of this economic strength has been capital spending by U.S. companies. The main driver has been the buildout of artificial intelligence (AI) capacity, especially by the mega-cap technology companies Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft. Figure 1: Total U.S. Capital Expenditures, 1950–2025 Historically, consumer spending accounts for roughly two-thirds of the U.S. economy. Shockingly, according to a post by Neil Dutta, head of economic research at Renaissance Macro Research, AI spending exceeded consumer expenditures in the last two quarters, as shown in the graphic below. “So far this year, AI capital expenditures (capex), which we define as information processing equipment plus software, have added more to GDP growth than consumer spending,” Dutta said. Figure 2: U.S. AI Capital Expenditures versus Personal Consumption (PCE), 2022–2025 Christopher Mims of The Wall Street Journal calculates that U.S. AI spending exceeded $100 billion in the previous quarter alone. "The AI infrastructure buildout is so gigantic that in the past six months, it contributed more to the growth of the U.S. economy than all of consumer spending. The Magnificent Seven spent more than $100 billion on data centers and related infrastructure in the past three months alone,” Mims wrote. Figure 3: Capital Expenditures of META, GOOGL, MSFT, AMZN, 2018–2025 As we discussed in October 2024, there are many sub-groups related to this spending, including the following O’Neil Industry Groups. Table 1: AI/Data Center-Related O’Neil Industry Groups A potential accelerant to overall capital spending comes from accelerated depreciation changes included in the recently passed Big Beautiful Bill. This law allows companies to deduct 100% of the depreciation of any qualified project or property in the first year it goes into service. This reduces a business’ taxes and helps improve near-term cash flow by reducing taxable income. This deduction covers most machinery, industrial equipment, computers, servers, and software, as well as some furniture, fixtures, and building components. As a result, we expect capital spending to rise over the next 12 months in AI and beyond. Thematic areas that may benefit include Power/Electrification, Aerospace, Industrial Manufacturing, Transportation, Telecommunications, and Life Science/Pharma. Across U.S.-based stocks with a market cap above $500M and at least $50M in annual sales, we analyzed ratios to identify potential beneficiaries. Then, we broke them down by O’Neil Major Industry (89 Groups, combines some of the 197 O’Neil Industry Groups together). 1) Percent of D&A versus sales (most recent annual period): used to find the most capital-intensive businesses, normalized for company size. Across all companies, the median percentage is 4.5%. Here are the major industries with the highest and lowest ratios. Table 2: Percent of D&A versus Sales of O’Neil Major Industries 2) Percentage of D&A versus total assets (most recent annual period): used to gauge how quickly businesses utilize their capital base, normalized for capital base size. Across all companies, the median percentage is 3.0%. Here are the major industries with the highest and lowest ratios. Table 3: Percent of D&A versus Assets of Major O’Neil Industries Major industries that appear on the left side in both of the above tables include Oil and Gas–Exploration/Production, Telecommunication Services, Metal Product and Fabrication, Oil and Gas–Integrated, Chemical, Shipping, Pollution Control, Semiconductors, Cement Aggregates, Agricultural Operation, Leisure Services, Trucking, and Paper and Forest Products. A handful of Health Care segments appear in the D&A versus sales table, while several Retail groups appear in the D&A versus assets table. Of the groups with higher ratios in each table (33 unique), the groups below are leading and/or reasonably well set-up from a technical perspective. Figure 4: Weekly Mini Charts of Key O’Neil Major Industries Despite the potential accelerated depreciation catalyst, tariff headwinds remain. In particular, non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft—which track new orders placed with U.S. manufacturers for durable capital goods designed to last more than three years—have seen mixed momentum. While orders are up from 2024 levels (Figure 5), they have recently pulled back (Figure 6) as businesses put off capital investments despite the tax advantages granted by the Big Beautiful Bill. Figure 5/6: U.S. Manufacturing Orders and Order Growth, 2022–2025 Overall, much like the Trump corporate tax cuts in his first term, we believe the benefits from the change in depreciation expensing are being underemphasized by the market. While capital goods orders have been weak recently, we think they will rise from current levels as the new law takes effect and tariff uncertainty eases. The above industry lists and charts provide fertile ground for investors interested in this theme. We expect select beneficiaries of the new law to deliver notable stock price outperformance over the next 12 months, and we encourage readers to incorporate this view into their current investment strategy.

Title: Grocery News Has Amazon Stock Delivering Gains. Does It Have a 'New Narrative' Now?

Time Published: 2025-08-14T20:59:27Z

Amazon's got some mojo. The tech and retail giant's stock has been a middling performer among the big names for much of the year. It was essentially flat in the first half, while a popular Magnificent 7 exchange-traded fund moved higher and both underperformed the benchmark S&P 500. More recently, shares of Amazon (AMZN) have shown substantial life. They finished Thursday up nearly 3%, extending Wednesday gains and leaving them just over 5% for the year—fifth-best among the group of seven tech giants year-to-date. Behind the latest bump: enthusiasm for yesterday's announcement that it would extend a move into fast delivery of fresh groceries, seen as a shot across the bows of other retailers and delivery companies. (Think Walmart (WMT), Instacart (CART) and Kroger (KR), for example.) Several Wall Street analysts applauded the move, which followed a second-quarter earnings announcement that disappointed some investors. "Fresh grocery has been a significant missing piece in Amazon's offering [versus] competitors," Bank of America wrote, naming Walmart and Target (TGT). "With better grocery capabilities, Amazon should see important customer frequency benefits and potential lock-in." Morgan Stanley estimates that offline grocery spending is worth about $1.5 trillion in the U.S., or nearly half of all offline consumer spending. Fresh and perishable goods, they write, are about 45% of that total; Amazon, they said, was at risk of losing grocery market share before its latest move. Better grocery service could also boost the value of Prime membership, according to JP Morgan analysts, who think the company could raise membership prices next year without significantly causing churn or eating into customer acquisition. Amazon is widely liked by Street analysts, who according to Visible Alpha are unanimously bullish. The current consensus price target, near $262, suggests a roughly 13% premium to Thursday's close. That's a solid enough outlook—to be sure, some Magnificent Seven stocks managed double-digit gains in the first half of 2025 alone—but CNBC's Jim Cramer, to name one observer, is now talking about a "new narrative" for the company. Based on the stock's latest rise, investors were eager to hear one.
