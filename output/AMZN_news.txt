The stock market shook off one of its worst sell-offs in recent memory to finish the first half of 2025 on a high note. That's lifted stocks associated with AI, crypto—and gold. How did we get here? It's been a ride. Stocks plummeted in early April after President Donald Trump unveiled sweeping global tariffs that threatened to scramble global supply chains, spike prices, and slow growth. Trump's subsequent pause of those tariffs, however, ignited a rally that was further fueled by benign economic data and easing trade tensions. By the end of June, stocks had rebounded to record highs. Wall Street's latest rally has looked a bit like last year's bull market. Artificial intelligence continued to connect many of the market's winners. But a few new themes have emerged amid the Trump administration's shake-up of the status quo. Here, we'll examine the stock market's leaders from the first six months of 2025—and examine how the forces underlying their gains could evolve in the next six. Crypto investors have been handsomely rewarded for the industry’s spending on November’s election. The industry last year spent more than $100 million in support of pro-crypto candidates. In January, the “most pro-crypto Congress” in history was sworn in and Washington wasted little time giving the industry what it wanted. Federal regulators have dropped pending litigation against cryptocurrency companies. Trump signed an executive order establishing a Bitcoin reserve. In May, the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, which would establish a framework for the regulation of cryptocurrencies, was introduced in the House of Representatives. And the Senate in June passed the GENIUS Act, legislation that establishes rules governing stablecoins. That's helped grow the cryptocurrency market's value to more than $3.2 trillion. Washington’s embrace, however, has also boosted related stocks this year. Robinhood (HOOD) stock more than doubled in price in the first half, while Coinbase (COIN) shares rose 41%. Circle Internet Group’s (CRCL) shares more than doubled during the stablecoin issuer’s first day of trading in early June; the stock rose nearly 750% in the two weeks after its debut. The cryptocurrency legislation working its way through Congress is expected to have little trouble making its way to Trump’s desk for signature in the second half of this year. Trump and his family may continue feeding the industry’s animal spirits with new crypto ventures. Analysts came into the year expecting the group of stocks considered emblematic of the AI trade to change. That has panned out to an extent. Leadership was expected to shift from AI infrastructure stocks—companies like Nvidia (NVDA), whose chips fill the data centers that cloud computing giants like Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) use to train and run AI models—to software and services providers developing and monetizing AI applications. Palantir (PLTR) was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 in the first half of the year; its impressive sales and earnings growth have been driven primarily by its AI software. Social media giant Meta Platforms (META) is the Magnificent Seven’s best performer year-to-date thanks in part to its success introducing AI features that have improved performance metrics. Software stocks are expected to continue to outperform as they improve AI models and develop new applications. They could also benefit from their relative insulation from trade uncertainty, which dented the overall stock market’s returns in the first half. AI infrastructure, a theme that outperformed for most of 2024, continued to be a winner on Wall Street in the first half of this year. Tech giants Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (GOOG), and Meta looked through economic uncertainty and stood by plans to cumulatively spend hundreds of billions of dollars on property, buildings, and equipment this year. Much of that spending is earmarked for the technology required to develop and run advanced AI, like Nvidia chips, Super Micro Computer (SMCI) servers, and Amphenol (APH) fiber optic cables. Those hardware suppliers saw their shares rise 18%, 61%, and 42%, respectively, in the first half. The buildout of power-hungry data centers boosted the stocks of nuclear power providers, whose electricity is in demand from tech companies who say they are looking to shrink their carbon footprints. Shares of Constellation Energy (CEG) and Vistra (VST) advanced 44% and 41%, respectively. But bringing new nuclear power online is a long process, and data centers are in the meantime relying on natural gas, boosting the stocks of gas-fired plant operators like NRG Energy (NRG), up 78% year-to-date, and gas turbine makers like GE Vernova (GEV), up 61%. Experts expect the AI infrastructure trade to be resilient. Tech giants “are planning for long-term data center capacity requirements and won’t alter their investment plans based on tariff regimes that change from week to week,” said Shaon Baqui, tech equities analyst at Janus Henderson Investors. The mood globally in the first half of 2025 was tense, to put it mildly. That was good for gold. In five months, the second Trump administration launched a global trade war targeting friends and foes alike; opened questions about America's commitment to longtime alliances like NATO; increased America’s involvement in Israel’s conflict with its neighbors; and ratcheted up tensions with China. Investors who sought stability turned to gold, a time-honored safe-haven asset. Gold prices climbed to record high after record high, peaking at more than $3,450 on June 13, the day Israel launched attacks on Iran’s nuclear program. Shares of gold miner Newmont (NEM) followed prices higher, rising 56% over the first half of the year. Fellow miners Barrick (B) and Agnico Eagle Mines (AEM) advanced 34% and 52%, respectively. Central banks, wary of inflation and their reliance on U.S.-controlled reserve assets, have been major buyers of gold in recent years. Demand for gold is expected to remain high for the foreseeable future as governments around the world seek to hedge against elevated geopolitical tensions and an uncertain global economic outlook. The World Gold Council’s most recent Central Bank Gold Reserves survey found that nearly all central banks expect global gold reserves to increase over the next 12 months. A record 43% of respondents said they plan to add to their gold holdings over the same period.

U.S. stock futures are pointing slightly lower as investors monitor trade talks and Senate budget negotiations; Tesla (TSLA) shares are falling in premarket trading as the feud between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump escalates again; Apple (AAPL) reportedly could turn to OpenAI or Anthropic for help enhancing its Siri voice-activated service; Oracle (ORCL) shares are hovering near the all-time high set Monday after the software provider reported lucrative new cloud deals; and Amazon's (AMZN) robotic workforce reportedly nears the size of its human staff in its warehouses. Here's what investors need to know today. U.S. stock futures are pointing slightly lower in premarket trading as investors monitor trade talks and Senate deliberations of budget legislation. S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures are down 0.2% after both indexes posted fresh all-time closing highs yesterday. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are ticking lower. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) and the 10-year Treasury yield are lower. Oil and gold futures are higher. Tesla shares are more than 5% lower in premarket trading as the feud between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump heats up again. "Elon may get more subsidy than any human being in history, by far, and without subsidies, Elon would probably have to close up shop and head back home to South Africa," Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform, hours after Musk again criticized the "One Big Beautiful Bill" being debated in the Senate, which includes a provision that would eliminate the $7,500 new EV tax credit. During the initial escalation of the public spat between Musk and Trump on June 5, shares tumbled 14%, erasing more than $150 billion from Tesla's market capitalization. Apple (AAPL) could turn to ChatGPT maker OpenAI or Anthropic after delays in the launch of its highly anticipated AI-enhanced Siri, according to a Bloomberg report. The iPhone maker has been in talks with both companies about using AI models instead of in-house technology, the report said, after significant delays have raised pressure on Apple to prove it can compete with other tech leaders on AI development. Shares of Apple are 0.6% higher in premarket trading after closing 2% higher yesterday following the report. Oracle (ORCL) shares are edging higher in premarket trading after closing at an all-time high of $218.63 Monday as CEO Safra Catz touted what she called a "strong start" to fiscal 2026, with several lucrative cloud deals, "including one that is expected to contribute more than $30 billion in annual revenue starting in FY28." Analysts at Stifel reportedly raised their price target for Oracle stock to $250 per share from $180, pointing to Oracle's strong cloud growth. Amazon (AMZN) soon will have as many robots working in its warehouses as it does humans, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal. Roughly 75% of the e-commerce giant's global deliveries "are assisted in some way by robotics," the Journal said, adding that "the average number of employees Amazon had per facility last year, roughly 670, was the lowest recorded in the past 16 years." Last month, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said he expected the company would trim its workforce over the next few years with the spread of artificial intelligence. Amazon shares are little changed in premarket trading.

Title: Why Jefferies Thinks Disney Stock Can Keep Climbing

Disney has set the stage for its stock to retouch levels last seen in 2022, Jefferies analysts said. Jefferies on Monday upgraded Disney (DIS) stock from “hold” to “buy," forecasting that its operating income will grow for the first time in nearly a decade. Favorable trends in theme park admission, cruise bookings and streaming subscriptions should contribute to the transition, analysts said. Disney shares were recently up less than 1%, trading for about $123. They’ve gained nearly 11% so far this year, steadily rising since mid-April, when the White House softened its approach to tariffs. Their climb may only be beginning, Jefferies said: It raised its price target for Disney shares to $144—the third highest target shared by analysts who follow Disney and are tracked by Visible Alpha, where the average target is around $131. “Since 2016, [Disney] has juggled several factors … leading to limited [operating income] growth and limited stock appreciation,” Jefferies wrote in a note that credited CEO Bob Iger with improving the company’s outlook. “However, we believe Iger and co. have finally righted the ship, and the drivers ahead can change this dynamic.” Disney plans to add two cruise ships to its fleet in early 2025, which could bolster revenue by about $1 billion to $1.5 billion, according to Jefferies’ estimates. Travel and tourism spending is holding up better than anticipated, which should help Disney’s theme parks, analysts added. The outlook for Disney’s streaming services is also bright, analysts said. Analysts estimate Disney+ can add 5 million subscribers annually over the next few years and boost advertising revenue thanks, in part, to an Amazon (AMZN) partnership that allows for more targeted ads.

Title: Mid-Year Outlook: Stocks Back At Highs

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone, Contributor. With stocks reaching a new high just as the midpoint of the year is reached, it is an opportune time ... More to look at what the second half of the year might hold. As the tariff threat eased and some progress was made on trade agreements, stocks have recovered sharply. The boost from technology and artificial intelligence-related companies was also notably in the rebound. With stocks reaching a new high just as the midpoint of the year is reached, it is an opportune time to look at what the second half of the year might hold. Rather than the traditional outlook, this will be an examination of the risks versus rewards, considering what is currently priced in financial markets. The massive US tariffs announced on Liberation Day sent the betting odds of recession soaring to 65%, with stocks dragged lower in expectation of lower earnings. As the tariff threat eased and some progress was made on trade agreements, stocks have recovered sharply. The recent 12-day military conflict between Israel and Iran caused concerns about an economically unfriendly oil shock. Still, the US bombing of Iran’s nuclear facilities has led to a ceasefire, which has cooled fears. Stocks & Recession Odds The betting odds of recession also tell much of the story about the US 10-year Treasury note yield. Yields fell as fears of an economic downturn rose and have since recovered from the lows, as economic risk appears to have waned. There is more to the story here, as signs suggest that bond markets worldwide are less willing to fund the unfavorable fiscal situations of most countries. Yields & Recession Odds Stocks soared last week on the ceasefire in the Israel-Iran war and the agreement around a framework for US-China trade. The S&P 500 surpassed its mid-February high by 0.5% after having declined by almost 20%. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has recovered to only 4% below its mid-December level after being as much as 30% under the peak. Apart from the good news on trade and Iran, the strength in US bank stocks was notable. Last week, the annual Federal Reserve (Fed) stress tests for large banks were better than expected. Additionally, the Fed made some changes to the methodology, which are expected to result in fewer Stress Capital Buffers (SCBs) being required for banks in the future. All other things being equal, less need for capital buffers means better profitability. Market Returns The more economically sensitive cyclical stocks have outperformed less economically impacted defensives since stocks bottomed, marking the peak of recession fears. The current situation is back to pricing in a benign, if not downright optimistic, economic backdrop. Economically-Sensitive Versus Defensive Stocks Based on the current 24.3 times current earnings and 23.4 times multiple of 2025 estimated earnings, also known as the forward price-to-earnings ratio, stocks do not look cheap relative to the past. However, historically, the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has been correlated with return-on-equity (ROE), which measures how efficiently companies generate profits from the capital provided by their shareholders. Although the ROE is down from its recent highs, it remains above average, which argues for an above-average P/E ratio, assuming this elevated ROE is sustainable. Consensus estimates project a return on equity of 18.6% in 2025 and 19.4% in 2026, up from 17.6% in 2024. To provide perspective, the S&P 500’s ROE was 15.1% in 2019 before the pandemic. S&P 500: Price-To-Earnings & ROE The composition of the large-cap US stock market is crucial to this improved outlook for ROE since much of the boost has come from technology and artificial intelligence-related companies. Even a simple analysis of the S&P 500 shows that at least 43% of the market capitalization is related to these two areas. Weights In S&P 500 As noted earlier, the exceptional return on equity supports the rich stock valuations, and profit margins are elevated relative to historical levels. Profit margins measure the percentage of top-line sales that are converted into bottom-line profits. As a business owner, higher profit margins, all other things being equal, are more valuable. Notably, the profit margins for the technology sector are almost twice the market. In addition, according to FactSet, technology sector earnings are expected to grow at 18% in 2025, while the S&P 500’s earnings are forecast to rise by about 9.1% year-over-year. S&P 500: Profitability According to Warren Buffett, “The value of a business is the cash it’s going to produce in the future, discounted back to the present.” Free cash flow measures the cash left over after a company supports its operations and maintains or invests further in its business. Thus, free cash flow provides a good measure of the money accruing to shareholders as owners. The free cash flow yield is calculated by dividing the free cash flow by the stock price. Consistent with the price-to-earnings ratio, the cash flow yield suggests that the stock market is not currently cheap, although it has been more expensive at times in the past. This metric assumes that free cash flow remains static, so it can also be interpreted as indicating that investors have more confidence that free cash flow will continue to grow. Indeed, investors should be willing to pay more for a company in which one can have high confidence that the corporate profits accruing to owners will continue to grow. As a subset of the S&P 500, technology stocks are priced at an even lower free cash flow yield. This valuation premium reflects the optimism about the future of many of these companies and the superior fundamentals of the group as a whole. The profit margins and earnings growth rate for the technology sector have been exceptional, which helps explain the premium valuation assigned by the lower free cash flow yield. One additional wrinkle is the massive capital spending (capex) that Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) are investing in artificial intelligence infrastructure. This spending is also depressing the current free cash flow yield for the technology-related stocks on the margin. Massive capital expenditure (capex) spending is often viewed as a red flag for investors, who are typically concerned that the substantial investment will not yield a sufficient return for the companies. However, these four companies are currently being given the benefit of the doubt. S&P 500: Free Cash Flow Yield The main event of the holiday-shortened trading week will be the monthly jobs report on Thursday. Economists expect June’s gain in nonfarm payrolls to slow to 113,000 from 139,000 in May. Notably, the unemployment rate is expected to rise to 4.3% from 4.2%. US Unemployment Rate Given the upward trend in weekly continuing claims for unemployment benefits, the expected uptick in unemployment is a reasonable assumption. The upward trend indicates that the job market has been softening as it is taking longer for those losing their jobs to get a new one. With expectations for the US economy rebounding and the risk of recession decreasing, the resilience of the labor market should be closely monitored. Continuing Claims For Unemployment Benefits Markets currently expect at least two 25-basis-point (0.25%) Fed cuts in 2025, consistent with the median Fed projection. There is a slight chance of a cut in July, but the first move lower in 2025 is fully priced for September. Fed Rate Cuts Expected In the wake of the rebound from the tariff-induced bear market decline in stocks, investors should revisit their risk tolerance, as the robust stock rally over the last couple of years has likely increased their allocation to risk assets. Rebalancing stock and bond allocations toward the target risk level is wise for many investors, especially given the ongoing presence of tariff, geopolitical, and fiscal risks. The key to successful long-term stock investing is staying invested during the inevitable tough times, as rebounds from those bear markets are typically massive and unpredictable in timing, as illustrated by the first half of this year. Stocks are priced for a benign economic outcome and some support from the Federal Reserve in lowering interest rates. Improving corporate profitability, with 9% earnings growth in 2025 and 14% in 2026, is forecasted to normalize currently elevated valuations. This outcome is certainly possible, if not the most probable, but investors should be mindful that the hurdles at these valuation levels are higher. The artificial intelligence wave is a real phenomenon as adoption continues, so the optimistic scenario is not entirely out of the realm of possibility. This optimism should be tempered by the fact that the economy and earnings can always disappoint, especially if the trade war heats up again; therefore, investors should be prepared for possible turbulence.
