We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. The stock market rally has stalled as the final Federal Reserve meeting of the year approaches. In the past week, the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was the only of the three major indexes to post a weekly gain, closing up more than 0.3%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell about 0.6%, while a decline in healthcare stocks weighed on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI), which slid nearly 2%. The Dow has now fallen for seven straight sessions, its worst stretch since February 2020. Investors are set to receive a jam-packed week of economic news, highlighted by the Fed's next interest rate decision on Dec. 18. Markets widely expect the Fed to cut interest rates by 25 basis points, and investors are likely to focus on what Fed Chair Jerome Powell says about the path forward in 2025 during his press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET on Wednesday. Updates on November retail sales, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index — the Fed's preferred inflation gauge — and activity in the services and manufacturing sectors are also on the economic calendar. In corporate news, quarterly results from Micron (MU), Nike (NKE), FedEx (FDX) and Carnival Corporation (CCL) are expected. Entering Wednesday's Federal Reserve meeting, markets are pricing in a roughly 97% chance the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates by 25 basis points, per the CME FedWatch tool. But given recent data that showed the US economy is growing at a solid pace, the labor market isn't rapidly cooling, and inflation's path to the Fed's 2% goal is proving bumpy, many expect the Fed will cut rates by less than initially thought in 2025. Key to watch is the Fed's latest Summary of Economic Projections (SEP). That includes its "dot plot," which maps out policymakers' expectations for where interest rates could be headed in the future, as well as commentary from Powell during his press conference. Read more: What experts say about the possibility of additional rate cuts When the Fed last issued its dot plot in September, the median forecast was for the fed funds rate to end 2025 in a range of 3.25% to 3.5%. Instead of the four rate cuts in 2024 projected back in September, markets are pricing in just two rate cuts for next year, per Bloomberg data. "We think that the economic forecasts will show better growth and firmer inflation this year and that the median interest rate forecast dots will be revised to show three cuts next year instead of four, as in the September dots," JPMorgan chief US economist Michael Feroli wrote in a note to clients. Bank of America US economist Aditya Bhave wrote in a note to clients that Powell is likely to point to a "slower pace" of cuts during his press conference including a pause in the rate-cutting cycle in January. Prior to the Fed's decision on Wednesday, officials will get a fresh reading on the state of the consumer with the November retail sales report. Economists estimate retail sales increased 0.5% over the prior month during October. The control group of retail sales — which excludes several volatile categories like gasoline and feeds directly into the gross domestic product (GDP) — is also expected to have risen by 0.4%. Bank of America's US economics team thinks this report will reflect a strong start to the holiday shopping period. "Online retail spending was particularly strong around the Thanksgiving period," the team wrote in a note to clients on Friday. "In fact, holiday spending is running ahead of cumulative 2023 levels despite a delayed Thanksgiving. Hence, we expect a robust retail sales report for Nov, with retail sales ex-autos and the core control category coming in at 0.5% m/m." Last week, readings of both the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and producer price index (PPI) showed signs of inflation making little progress toward the Fed's 2% target. But many economists argued that there were promising signs within the details of those reports that should lead to a less concerning reading of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge next Friday. Economists expect annual "core" PCE — which excludes the volatile categories of food and energy — to have clocked in at 2.9% in November, up from the 2.8% seen in October. But over the prior month, economists project "core" PCE at 0.2%, lower than the 0.3% increase seen in October. "In our view, November data on inflation should provide comfort that the disinflation process remains in place," Morgan Stanley chief US economist Michael Gapen wrote in a note to clients on Friday. "Although headline and core CPI came in slightly above our expectation ... we found the details of the report favorable for thinking inflation would continue to move lower in the near-term." For 10 straight trading days more stocks have declined than risen in the S&P 500, the longest such stretch since September 2001. Still, over that time period which spans all of December thus far, the S&P 500 is up about 0.3%. Meanwhile, the equal-weighted version of the S&P 500 (^SPXEW), which isn't overly influenced by movements in large stocks within the index, is down more than 3%. "Savvy traders should at least pay attention to some of the warning signs about the overall health of the market. So far, it is the sniffles or just a case of bad breadth," Interactive Brokers chief strategist Steve Sosnick wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. "But there are some symptoms that can lead to something more meaningful if left unattended." To Sosnick's point, for now, a rally in the largest tech stocks in the market is keeping the benchmark index afloat. On Wednesday the Nasdaq Composite closed above 20,000 for the first time ever as Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Tesla (TSLA), Meta (META), and Amazon (AMZN) all surged to record highs Charles Schwab senior investment strategist Kevin Gordon told Yahoo Finance that this market action comes as investors have been digesting sticky inflation prints, and the possibility of the Fed cutting interest rates less than initially, though next year isn't a "surprise." "If rates are going to stay a little bit more elevated for a little bit longer than the consensus expected, then companies who have a net benefit from higher rates probably do well in that scenario," Gordon said while noting that the "Magnificent Seven" stocks fit that description.

Title: Elon Musk is so rich he makes Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg look poor
URL: https://qz.com/elon-musk-net-worth-wealth-spacex-tesla-xai-bezos-meta-1851718701
Time Published: 2024-12-11T18:19:00Z
Full Content:
Elon Musk was already the richest person on the planet. Now, thanks to Tesla, xAI, and SpaceX’s surging valuations, he’s worth more than $400 billion, according to Bloomberg News’s calculations. Specifically, he’s worth $439.2 billion. For reference, the next richest men alive are Amazon (AMZN+1.47%) founder and Blue Origin owner Jeff Bezos, Meta (META+0.17%) CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and Oracle (ORCL-0.86%) Chief Technology Officer Larry Ellison, according to the Bloomberg Billionaire Index. They’re worth, respectively, $244 billion, $219 billion, and $197 billion. Musk is also at least as wealthy as Mansa Musa, the emperor of the West African Mali Empire and previous record holder of richest man to ever live, who historians estimate was worth around $400 billion, according to the BBC. The impetus for Musk’s latest surge in wealth is SpaceX’s newfound value of $350 billion, which makes it the most valuable startup in the world. On Wednesday, SpaceX and its investors agreed to buy $1.25 billion of shares from employees and company insiders. “What’s really crazy about this is that almost no investors wanted to sell shares even at a $350B valuation! SpaceX reduced the amount of shares it bought back from employees in order to allow some new investors in,” Musk wrote on his X Wednesday. Besides SpaceX, Musk is the CEO of Tesla and owner of X. Corp. His other companies include artificial intelligence startup xAI, brain chip firm Neuralink, and tunneling firm The Boring Company. xAI, recently raised $6 billion at a $50 billion valuation less than two years after he founded it. That’s also more than double its valuation in May, when it was valued at $24 billion at a value of $6 billion from backers like Andreessen Horowitz and Saudi Arabian investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal. Musk owns more than 13% of Tesla shares, which have surged since President-elect Donald Trump won the presidential election in November. The stock climbed to a new record of $415 per share on Wednesday, narrowly surpassing its prior record for intraday trading of $414.50 per share on Nov. 4, 2021. In recent weeks, investors have been excited by Trump’s potential actions that could aid the automaker, including streamlining autonomous vehicle regulations and ending the $7,500 consumer tax credits for electric vehicles. Musk has said that ending those credits will hurt Tesla’s rivals more than it damages his company, although analysts expect some downside in the short term. Several analysts have also raised their price targets for the stock in recent days as they look to catch up with the stock surge, often pointing to Tesla’s plans for driverless vehicles and humanoid robots.

Title: Stock market today: Nasdaq tops 20,000 for first time as Big Tech surge leads stocks higher

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks rallied on Wednesday, led by Big Tech, as investors digested another month of sticky inflation data that met economists' expectations and likely pointed to a Federal Reserve interest rate cut next week. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped about 1.7% amid a feverish rally in the "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks. Google parent Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) shares extended gains to hit a record high, up as much as 4.6%. Meanwhile Tesla (TSLA), Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL) all also surged to record highs. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose around 0.8%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) hugged the after initially opening the day higher. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices soared to trade above $100,600 a token in afternoon trade. Fresh inflation data out on Wednesday showed consumer prices rose as forecast in November, keeping the Federal Reserve on track to lower interest rates again in December. The latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased 2.7% over the prior year in November, a slight uptick from October's 2.6% annual gain in prices. The yearly increase matched economist expectations. On a "core" basis, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, prices in November climbed 0.3% over the prior month, matching October, and posted an annual rate of 3.3% for the fourth consecutive month. Earlier on Wednesday, a report that China is considering devaluing its currency sent ripples through global stock markets and boosted the dollar (DX=F). The potential move is seen as a response to higher tariffs promised by President-elect Donald Trump, as a weaker yuan (CNHUSD=X) could make Chinese exports cheaper. On the corporate front, Macy's (M) stock somewhat recovered from double-digit losses earlier in the session after the department store chain lowered its full-year profit guidance. The retailer released its third-quarter results after delaying the report while it investigated an employee hiding up to $154 million in expenses. The "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks are roaring in Wednesday's post inflation print rally. Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) are all up more than 1% while Apple (AAPL) stock is also in the green. At some point in the session, Alphabet, Tesla, Meta, Amazon and Apple all touched intraday record highs. Meanwhile, Roundhill's Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS), which tracks all seven stocks, is also at a record high. Up more nearly 3% on Wednesday, the group was far outpacing the 0.9% gain in the S&P 500 (^GSPC). This is a continuation from the trend seen since the start of December. In the past month, the Magnificent Seven ETF is up nearly 9% while the S&P 500 is up just more than 1%. Here are some of the top trending tickers on the Yahoo Finance homepage... Macy's (M): Macy's stock fell around 5% on Wednesday, somewhat recovering from earlier double-digit losses. The company reported its official third quarter results upon the conclusion of an internal investigation into an employee hiding up to $151 million of expenses that led to a delay in reporting. As Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma reports, the tepid earnings report was broadly in line with the preliminary results shared last month. Macy's reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.04, which beat Wall Street's expectation of $0.03. Net sales declined 2.4% from a year ago to $4.74 billion, versus $4.75 billion expected. Same-store sales declined 1.3%, compared to estimates of 1.39%. The company lowered its full-year profit guidance as it closes stores in a turnaround push. It now expects adjusted profit per share of $2.25 to $2.50, versus its prior forecast of $2.34 to $2.69. Super Micro Computer (SMCI): The stock extended declines, falling over 8% despite comments from CEO Charles Liang, who said Tuesday that he does not believe the company will be delisted from the Nasdaq. As Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton has reported, shares have been on a wild ride in recent months as the company continues to grapple with the the fallout from an August report by short seller firm Hindenburg Research. The report pointed to alleged accounting malpractices, violations of export controls, and shady relationships between top executives and Super Micro partners. Shares had started the week under pressure after JPMorgan (JPM) analyst Samik Chatterjee on Monday maintained an Underweight rating on the stock. Shares are down about 50% over the past six months. Housing prices have remained stubbornly high, proving to be a sticky category for inflation. But the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) out Wednesday showed the pace of housing cost increases has begun to ease. Yahoo Finance's Dani Romero reports: Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed shelter costs, the largest component of CPI, rose 0.3% compared to the previous month in November. This was lower than October’s 0.4% increase. On an annual basis, shelter costs rose 4.7% in November, down from October’s year-over-year gain of 4.9% and the smallest 12-month increase since early 2022. Still, the shelter component accounted for 40% of November’s overall monthly CPI increase. "Finally, the slow grind lower in shelter inflation continued to play out last month, which is an encouraging development," Jeff Schulze, head of economic and market strategy at ClearBridge Investments, wrote in a note to clients after the release. Economists have long expected a slowdown in rent increases, a trend that has been reflected in other data, but the broad cooldown in rents has not appeared in the CPI report. This discrepancy can be partly attributed to the BLS collecting rent data every six months, leading to a lag in reporting. The government said the index for rent rose 0.2% in November, the lowest since July 2021. Read more here. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices rocketed higher on Wednesday to cross the critical $100,00 mark again after November's CPI report met expectations. In mid-morning trade, the largest cryptocurrency rose 5% to trade at around $100,700 a token. Other smaller cryptocurrencies and crypto-adjacent names mimicked bitcoin's moves to the upside. Ethereum (ETH-USD) rose nearly 7% to trade around $3,800 a coin. Meanwhile, shares of MicroStrategy (MSTR), which owns nearly 280,000 bitcoins, climbed around 6%. The company recently announced the purchase of an additional 51,780 bitcoins for $4.6 billion. MicroStrategy's bitcoin holdings are now worth $16.5 billion. Coinbase (COIN), which allows crypto trading on its platform, also saw shares rise roughly 6%. Bitcoin took a breather on Tuesday after prices enjoyed a record-setting rally on the heels of Donald Trump's presidential win. His coming administration is viewed as generally more friendly to the alternative asset class. In July, Trump attended a bitcoin conference in Nashville and has since pledged to usher in more supportive regulation. His promises also included appointing a crypto Presidential Advisory Council and replacing current SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who has since announced he will step down on Jan. 20. Consumer price increases met expectations in November — but overall, inflation still remains hot. The sticky nature of the print "is a little disconcerting," Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, wrote on Wednesday. "But we don’t expect it to persuade the Fed to skip another 25bp rate cut at next week’s FOMC meeting." Immediately following the report, markets continued to price in another 25 basis point cut at the central bank's meeting next week, with the odds of a cut rising to 98.1% from about an 89% chance one day prior. "As markets came into today’s figure with fears of an upside surprise, the in-line number is being received very positively," wrote Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. "But overall, the Fed will be concerned by the very stubborn nature of inflation and will be increasingly cautious about the upside inflation risks that President-elect Trump’s policies may bring." Trump's proposed policies, such as high tariffs on imported goods, tax cuts for corporations, and curbs on immigrationm are considered by economists to be potentially inflationary. Those policies could further complicate the Fed's path forward for interest rates. "We expect the Fed to move off autopilot in January, adopting a more cautious tone, and slowing its pace of cuts to just every other meeting," Shah said. Assuming a 25 basis point cut next week, markets are pricing in another two to three cuts in 2025, according to the latest Bloomberg data. Read more here. US stocks enjoyed broad-based gains early Wednesday as consumer prices rose as forecast in November, cementing bets the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its policy meeting next week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) moved up about 0.2%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) jumped nearly 0.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) added to the across-the-board gains, rising roughly 0.8%. New inflation data out Wednesday showed consumer prices rose as forecast in November, reflecting another month where price increases made little progress toward the Federal Reserve's 2% target. The latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased 2.7% over the prior year in November, a slight uptick from October's 2.6% annual gain in prices. The yearly increase matched economist expectations. The index rose 0.3% over the previous month, matching economists' expectations but higher than the 0.2% seen in October. On a "core" basis, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, prices in October climbed 0.3% over the prior month, matching October, and 3.3% over last year for the fourth consecutive month.

Title: What’s Happening With Amazon Stock?

LAS VEGAS, NEVADA - DECEMBER 3: An attendee passes an AWS logo at AWS re:Invent 2024, a conference ... [+] hosted by Amazon Web Services, at The Venetian Las Vegas on December 3, 2024 in Las Vegas, Nevada. (Photo by Noah Berger/Getty Images for Amazon Web Services) Amazon stock (NASDAQ: AMZN) has fared well this year, rising by close to 50% so far. This is well ahead of fellow big tech titans Apple and Alphabet which remain up by about 34% each. Amazon has clearly gotten a lot of things right. Amazon’s massive recommence infrastructure investments made over the last several years are showing clear signs of paying off, as operating profits surge. The company has also executed well on its advertising business. Also see, Buy, Sell, Or Hold Costco Stock? Amazon is also seen as a big winner in the generative AI space, driven by its cloud business. Also, Google has announced a potential tech breakthrough. See What’s Happening With Google Stock? So what are some of the recent developments for Amazon stock? Amazon is doubling down on designing its proprietary AI chips. Last week, the company unveiled Trainium3, its most powerful in-house AI chip, which it says is 2x as fast as its predecessor, Trainium2, while delivering roughly 40% better energy efficiency. The chips are expected to be available in 2025 and will reportedly be fabricated using TSMC’s latest 3nm technology. Whether development goes smoothly or runs into delays, could add volatility to the stock price. Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. Amazon is marketing its AI products to other companies. For instance, Apple says that uses Amazon’s AI chips for certain tasks such as search. The consumer tech giant has also indicated that it was evaluating if the latest Amazon chip can be used to train AI models included in Apple Intelligence. Separately, Amazon announced plans for a massive AI supercomputer built using hundreds of thousands of Trainium2 chips. While Amazon is expected to remain a significant customer of Nvidia’s cutting-edge GPUs, its in-house chip development could eventually help it lower costs for its AWS business and potentially build new revenue streams. See why it may be time to sell Nvidia stock and buy Intel Amazon is expanding into the automotive space with its new venture Amazon Autos, which will enable customers to purchase vehicles in 48 U.S. cities. The platform will initially focus on selling new cars, with South Korea’s Hyundai starting off as its launch partner. Amazon has indicated that it intends to gradually expand by adding more brands, as well as cities in the coming years. Amazon will act as a go-between, connecting customers to local dealerships that will remain the final sellers of the vehicles. Although Amazon has little experience in the auto industry, its vast and highly engaged customer base as well as the widespread dissatisfaction with traditional car dealership experiences should give it a meaningful opportunity. Now looking over a slightly longer period, the returns for Amazon stock have been more volatile than the S&P 500 at 2% in 2021, -50% in 2022, and 81% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Amazon stock is increasingly seen as a reasonable value. While the company has historically traded at negative or triple-digit price-to-earnings ratios, its valuation metrics are improving. The company’s stock currently trades at about 35x 2025 consensus earnings. Although revenue growth may slow, Amazon’s margins are clearly on an upward trajectory. Amazon has implemented effective cost management strategies, adopting a more measured hiring pace and enhancing operational efficiency. Over the last quarter, Amazon’s cloud division, reported an operating income of $10.4 billion, a remarkable 50% increase year-over-year, significantly outpacing revenue growth of 19%. Amazon has also been tweaking its capex strategy, reducing spending on lower-return e-commerce infrastructure, while doubling down on technology infrastructure to meet rising artificial intelligence demand. At its current market price of $225, the stock is trading roughly in line with the Trefis price estimate of $230 per share - the Trefis estimate for Amazon’s valuation.

John Miner, 2024-12-11 Before the invention of shortcuts in Microsoft Fabric, big data engineers had to create pipelines to read data from external sources such as Google Cloud Platform (GCP) buckets and write into Azure Data Lake Storage. This duplication of data is at risk of becoming stale over time. Additionally, computing power might be wasted on bringing over data that is used one time. With today’s companies being comprised of mergers and acquisitions over time, your company’s data landscape might exist in multiple cloud vendors. How can we virtualize the data stored in GCP buckets in our Microsoft Fabric Lakehouse design? Our manager has asked us to create a virtualized data lake using GCP buckets and Microsoft Fabric Lakehouse. The new shortcut feature will be used to link to both files and delta tables. Most of the article will be centered around setting up a GCP trial account, loading data into GCP buckets, and creating a service account to access those buckets. Once the data is linked, a little work will be needed to either create a managed delta table or test linked delta tables. At the end of this article, the big data engineer will be comfortable with Microsoft Fabric Shortcuts using GCP buckets as a source. We need an account within google first before we can start a trial subscription. Go to the following URL to start the process. For some reason, you have to supply a birthdate and gender as part of the sign-up process. Google will suggest some account names that are not currently in use. The name I gave my user account is gcp2fabric. This describes how we want the data to flow from GCP to Fabric. Most cloud systems want a recovery email. That way if the google account gets locked, a password reset email can be sent to my john@craftydba.com mailbox. There is always a review or confirm page when using a graphical user interface. Hit the next button to see the details. Make sure you add a recovery mobile phone. Both the email and phone are verified by receiving and verifying access codes. Go to the security screen to enable two factor authentication for a product system. Because this is a proof of concept, I am going to use a username and strong password. The free credits from Google Cloud Platform are quite nice. It is $300 dollars or 90 days. Whichever limit comes first ends the trial. Make sure you are signed in with you google account and then start the trial process. The payment verification screen is a two-part process. First, you must enter billing information. Second, you will need a credit card to back the account. The card is never charged. But watch out for those pesky popups that ask you to convert to a real account. That is when the billing starts! Here is yet another set of demographic screens in which Google wants my personal information. To recap, creating both a Google Account and Google Cloud Platform trial are very easy tasks. The main idea behind Fabric Shortcuts is the virtualization of data from GCP to Fabric using memory to cache the files. There are five steps to create a GCP bucket: supply a name, choose a region, pick a storage class, determine access controls, and select a data protection strategy. Be careful when using the upload folder button. If you are impatient and do not wait, partial folder/file uploads might occur. If you are a patient person, then just wait for the start and end notifications. Right now, we have a storage account with five folders worth of stock data. However, we do not have any way to access the bucket. Most cloud vendors have the idea of a service account. Usually, this account does not have access to the cloud console. It is intended for use with programs to automate a task. Go to the settings section of the GCP bucket. Choose the create a key for a service account button. The name of the service account is not important since we just need the access key and access secret. I chose to name the service account as svc-gcp2fabric-poc. I chose to give the service account administrator access to the folders in this bucket. Click the create a key option under settings to generate the key for the service account. Please record both the key and the secret. The secret cannot be retrieved after you close this screen. The next step is to test access to the storage account using a program. The cloud tools for PowerShell is where you can learn about the cmdlets available to the PowerShell programmer. Run the code snippet below to get started. The first statement installs the cmdlets for PowerShell. The second command installs the command line interface (CLI). One must use the command line to authenticate to the cloud service before you can execute PowerShell cmdlets in your favorite tool. I am using VS code with the PowerShell extension. The next few screens go over the installation program for the Google CLI. The above screen starts the installation process. The screen below shows the license agreement. Click I agree with the licensing to continue. You can install the CLI interface for the current user or all users. The destination directory is aptly named. If you want to change the location, do it now. The process extracts the components from the downloaded bundle. The tools are finally installed. Click next to continue. The gcloud init command from the CLI shell starts a local sign in process to GCP using the default web browser. The SDK is smart enough to find three accounts assigned to my profile information. We want the last account which was created for this demonstration. Now that the tools are installed, we can test downloading and uploading files to the GCP Bucket. I used the Google Cloud cmdlets to create four separate tests. I am assuming you have logged into GCP using the CLI. The command shell output from the CLI command is shown below. The complete PowerShell script is shown below. Please load the script into VS Code that has been set up with the latest PowerShell add-in. I created four separate tasks in the script. Use the $test variable to determine which test to run next. The first task is to show the buckets in my GCP project. I used the Get-GcsBucket cmdlet retrieve the output seen below. The second task is to get a list of all files into a variable named $files. The Get-GcsObject cmdlet returns detailed information of each file stored in the bucket. We want to filter just for Microsoft stock data. Since there is five years of data, we are expecting five files in the result set. Please see the image below for details. The third task is to download those files into a local directory named gcp-bucket-test. The Remove-Item cmdlet allows us to remove any existing files before downloading from the bucket. The error action is set to silently continue if there are no files. The Read-GcsObject cmdlet is used to download a single file. If you refer back to the script at the beginning of this section, the download is a culmination of the first two tests plus a for loop. The very last test is to upload the advwrks folder to the cloud. This folder contains 11 delta tables. The image shows the working directory for our GCP bucket test. The New-GcsObject cmdlet uploads a folder from local storage to cloud storage. The output shows the parquet and json files being uploaded to the GCP cloud. The exploration of the PowerShell cmdlets has given me more confidence that the shortcuts will work. However, we did not test the access key and secret with code yet. There are two types of shortcuts supported in the Fabric Lakehouse. The first shortcut allows the developer to virtualize files. The second shortcut virtualizes the Delta Tables in the Lakehouse Hive Catalog. Let’s first work with the File Shortcuts. Today, we are going to work with the GCP shortcuts that are in preview. Please enter information about the bucket URL as well as the service account. That saved information for a HMAC key comes in handy right now. Here is a professional tip. Create the shortcuts using the lowest directory level. I want a shortcut for each folder in the GCP bucket. The new short screen basically asks you to double check your work at this time. Now, we want to create shortcuts for the eleven Delta Tables. The GUI is smart enough to know we created a connection already for this storage URL. Again, choose the lowest leaf in the directory tree for shortcuts. This will result in a shortcut for each folder that contains a delta table. One more verification of shortcuts needs to be done before our tasks are completed. Now that shortcuts are defined for Files and Tables, it is time to create some Python code in a Spark notebook to test them. The quickest test is to use the GUI in Fabric to inspect the various shortcuts. The image below shows the data in the currency Delta Table from the Adventure Works database. We can even preview the data stored in a CSV file. Since we are working with GCP, I want to see the GOGGLE stock prices in 2013.11 The files for the S&P 500 data set are interesting in themselves. However, having this data in a single Delta Table by year is more user friendly than hundreds of files. The PySpark code below uses a list of years as a metadata driver for loading each of the directories into a single Delta Table. The output from running the above cell in Microsoft Fabric Lakehouse is below. Each year has about 125,000 records or more of data. Business Users come up with interesting requests. We have been asked to create tables just for Amazon, Google and Microsoft stock data. How can we achieve this result? The code below uses the same year list as a driver for the for-loop. We are going to create dynamic SQL to union all file tables together. The secret to this technique is to use the result SELECT statement as input to the CREAT TABLE AS statement. Now that we have the Amazon stock data, we can group and aggregate to find the number of trading days per month and the average stock price. The code below uses Spark SQL to look at the data ranked by month and year. The output from the Spark SQL statement is shown below. This is a good test since we used all five File shortcuts and have read all stock data files. If we look at the Lakehouse Object Explorer, we can see 6 new tables have been created. I leave using the CTAS code to create tables for both Google and Microsoft as an exercise for the reader. The next set of code joins 8 of the 11tables in the adventure works schema into a flattened reporting table named rpt_prepared_data. Now to solve the business question of what sold the most by year, month, region, and model. The output of this query can be ranked by Total Amount to make the result stand out. I leave that improvement as an exercise for you to try. The output shows the last month of 2010 and the first month of 2011. The road-150 model was very popular in December 2010 in both North America and the Pacific. One last test to complete our analysis. We know that shortcuts are read only. What happens if we try to write to a folder that is a shortcut? The above Python snippet fails with the following output. In short, this operation is not supported through shortcuts. The creation of the GCP resources was the hardest part of this article. When creating shortcuts to a GCP bucket, you need to create a service account with access to the bucket. Create an Access Key and Secret commonly known as an HMAC key. Microsoft PowerShell can be used to validate uploading and downloading files and folders. There are two types of shortcuts. File shortcuts point to folders in the GCP bucket. The files in these buckets can be of any type that the Spark Engine can read. By themselves, these files are not useful. Use the Spark Engine to read, translate and write the information to a delta table. Managed delta tables are where you want to be. One Lake shortcuts or shortcuts to Tables require the source data to be in a delta file format. Selecting the lowest level folder in the directory structure makes each folder look like a table. Up to 50 shortcuts can be created at one time using the graphical user interface within the Fabric console. To summarize, shortcuts are read only pointers to tables and files. The tables can stand by themselves since they are in the delta file format. The files must be ingested into your local One Lake to be of any reporting value. I really like shortcuts and will be exploring the last cloud vendor, Microsoft Azure, in the future. Log in or register to rate You rated this post out of 5.
