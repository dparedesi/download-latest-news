U.S. stock market futures rose today following the Federal Reserve's rate cut, with all three major indexes climbing in early trading. The Fed lowered interest rates by 25 basis points, marking its first cut of the year, and signaled the possibility of two more cuts in 2025, boosting investor sentiment. The rate cut helped lift optimism in sectors poised to benefit from lower borrowing costs, especially tech stocks, which contributed to the Nasdaq's stronger futures gain. The small-cap Russell 2000 futures also rose significantly, expected to thrive in a lower interest rate environment.

Title: Build Agentic Workflows with OpenAI GPT OSS on Amazon SageMaker AI and Amazon Bedrock AgentCore
URL: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/build-agentic-workflows-with-openai-gpt-oss-on-amazon-sagemaker-ai-and-amazon-bedrock-agentcore/
Time Published: 2025-09-17T19:31:44Z

AWS Blogs OpenAI has released two open-weight models, gpt-oss-120b (117 billion parameters) and gpt-oss-20b (21 billion parameters), both built with a Mixture of Experts (MoE) design and a 128K context window. These models are the leading open source models, according to Artificial Analysis benchmarks, and excel at reasoning and agentic workflows. With Amazon SageMaker AI, you can fine-tune or customize models and deploy with your choice of framework through a fully managed service. Amazon SageMaker Inference gives you the flexibility to bring your own inference code and framework without having to build and maintain your own clusters. Although large language models (LLMs) excel at understanding language and generating content, building real-world agentic applications requires complex workflow management, tool calling capabilities, and context management. Multi-agent architectures address these challenges by breaking down complex systems into specialized components, but they introduce new complexities in agent coordination, memory management, and workflow orchestration. In this post, we show how to deploy gpt-oss-20b model to SageMaker managed endpoints and demonstrate a practical stock analyzer agent assistant example with LangGraph, a powerful graph-based framework that handles state management, coordinated workflows, and persistent memory systems. We will then deploy our agents to Amazon Bedrock AgentCore, a unified orchestration layer that abstracts away infrastructure and allows you to securely deploy and operate AI agents at scale. In this solution, we build an agentic stock analyzer with the following key components: The following diagram illustrates the solution architecture. This architecture illustrates a multi-agent workflow hosted on Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime running on AWS. A user submits a query, which is handled by a pipeline of specialized agents—Data Gathering Agent, Stock Performance Analyzer Agent, and Stock Report Generation Agent—that are each responsible for a distinct part of the stock evaluation process. These agents collaborate within Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime, and when language understanding or generation is required, they invoke a GPT OSS model hosted on SageMaker AI. The model processes the input and returns structured outputs that inform agent actions, enabling a fully serverless, modular, and scalable agentic system using open-source models. Customers who want to customize their models and frameworks can deploy using serverful deployments, but this requires access to GPUs, serving frameworks, load balancers, and infrastructure setup. SageMaker AI provides a fully managed hosting platform that takes care of provisioning the infrastructure with the necessary drivers, downloads the models, and deploys them. OpenAI’s GPT-OSS models are launched with a 4-bit quantization scheme (MXFP4), enabling fast inference while keeping resource usage low. These models can run on P5(H100), P6(H200), and P4(A100) and G6e(L40) instances.The GPT-OSS models are sparse MoE architectures with 128 experts (120B) or 32 experts (20B), where each token is routed to 4 experts with no shared expert. Using MXFP4 for MoE weights alone reduces the model sizes to 63 GB (120B) and 14 GB (20B), making them runnable on a single H100 GPU. To deploy these models effectively, you need a powerful serving framework like vLLM. To deploy the model, we build a vLLM container with the latest version that supports GPT OSS models on SageMaker AI. You can use the following Docker file and script to build the container and push it to a local Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR). The recommended approach is to do this directly from Amazon SageMaker Studio, which provides a managed JupyterLab environment with AWS CLI access where you can build and push images to ECR as part of your SageMaker workflow. Alternatively, you can also perform the same steps on an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance with Docker installed. After you have built and pushed the container to Amazon ECR, you can open Amazon SageMaker Studio by going to the SageMaker AI console, as shown in the following screenshot. You can then create a Jupyter space or use an existing one to launch JupyterLab and run notebooks. Clone the following notebook and run “Option 3: Deploying from HF using BYOC.” Update the required parameters, such as the inference image in the notebook with the container image. We also provide necessary environment variables, as shown in the following code. After you set up the deployment configuration, you can deploy to SageMaker AI using the following code: You can now run an inference example: For our stock analyzing multi-agent system, we use LangGraph to orchestrate the workflow. Jupyter notebook for the code is located in this github repository. The system comprises three specialized tools that work together to analyze stocks comprehensively: For local testing, you can use a simplified version of the system by importing the necessary functions from your local script. For example: This way, you can iterate quickly on your agent’s logic before deploying it to a scalable platform, making sure each component functions correctly and the overall workflow produces the expected results for different types of stocks. After you have developed and tested your LangGraph framework locally, you can deploy it to Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime. Amazon Bedrock AgentCore handles the heavy lifting of container orchestration, session management, scalability and abstracting the management of infrastructure. It provides persistent execution environments that can maintain an agent’s state across multiple invocations. Before deploying our stock analyzer agent to Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime, we need to create an AWS Identity and Access Management IAM role with the appropriate permissions. This role allows Amazon Bedrock AgentCore to invoke your SageMaker endpoint for GPT-OSS model inference, manage ECR repositories for storing container images, write Amazon CloudWatch logs for monitoring and debugging, access Amazon Bedrock AgentCore workload services for runtime operations, and send telemetry data to AWS X-Ray and CloudWatch for observability. See the following code: After creating the role, you can use the Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Starter Toolkit to deploy your agent. The toolkit simplifies the deployment process by packaging your code, creating the necessary container image, and configuring the runtime environment: When you’re using BedrockAgentCoreApp, it automatically creates an HTTP server that listens on port 8080, implements the required /invocations endpoint for processing the agent’s requirements, implements the/ping endpoint for health checks (which is very important for asynchronous agents), handles proper content types and response formats, and manages error handling according to AWS standards. After you deploy to Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime, you will be able to see the status show as Ready on the Amazon Bedrock AgentCore console. After you create the agent, you must set up the agent invocation entry point. With Amazon AgentCore Runtime, we decorate the invocation part of our agent with the @app.entrypoint decorator and use it as the entry point for our runtime. After you deploy the agent to Amazon AgentCore Runtime, you can invoke it using the AWS SDK: After invoking the stock analyzer agent through Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Runtime, you must parse and format the response for clear presentation. The response processing involves the following steps: The system also includes error handling that gracefully handles JSON parsing errors, falls back to plain text display if structured parsing fails, and provides debugging information for troubleshooting parsing issues of the stock analysis response. This formatted output makes it straightforward to review the agent’s decision-making process and present professional stock analysis results to stakeholders, completing the end-to-end workflow from model deployment to meaningful business output: You can delete the SageMaker endpoint to avoid accruing costs after your testing by running the following cells in the same notebook: You can also delete Amazon Bedrock AgentCore resources using the following commands: In this post, we built an end-to-end solution for deploying OpenAI’s open-weight models on a single G6e(L40s) GPU, creating a multi-agent stock analysis system with LangGraph and deploying it seamlessly with Amazon Bedrock AgentCore. This implementation demonstrates how organizations can now use powerful open source LLMs cost-effectively with efficient serving frameworks such as vLLM. Beyond the technical implementation, enhancing this workflow can provide significant business value, such as reduction in stock analysis processing time, increased analyst productivity by automating routine stock assessments. Furthermore, by freeing analysts from repetitive tasks, organizations can redirect skilled professionals toward complex cases and relationship-building activities that drive business growth. We invite you to try out our code samples and iterate your agentic workflows to meet your use cases. Vivek Gangasani is a Worldwide Lead GenAI Specialist Solutions Architect for SageMaker Inference.

Title: Google's Nano Banana Moment: 50% Upside For GOOG Stock?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/09/17/googles-nano-banana-moment-50-upside-for-goog-stock/

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Google's stock has been making headlines, surpassing the $3 trillion market cap milestone as investor confidence grows. But here’s the bigger takeaway: even after this rally, Google still trades at a notable discount compared to Big Tech peers like Amazon and Microsoft. This recent surge isn’t just market hype—it could mark the start of a 50% rally for GOOG stock as the market finally recognizes that Google deserves premium valuations and reconsiders its pricing. The narrative around Google and AI is shifting. Remember when there was widespread fear that AI would cannibalize Google Search? That fear is quickly fading. Google’s Gemini, especially its viral “nano banana” feature, has propelled the Gemini app to the #1 spot on Apple’s App Store in the U.S. This shows that AI can enhance Google’s core offerings instead of threatening them. The market is finally acknowledging what we’ve been saying all along: treating AI as an existential threat to Google was always an overreaction. Instead, AI is turning out to be a complementary force that strengthens Google’s ecosystem. While we’ll explore Google stock’s upside below, if you want growth with less volatility than holding a single stock, check out the High Quality Portfolio. It has consistently outperformed its benchmark—a blend of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—with over 91% returns since inception. Also see – Can Natera Stock Reach $500? Here’s where the numbers get interesting. Google has long been the overlooked Big Tech player in terms of valuation multiples, and the data paints a compelling picture: The fundamentals say yes. Consider these key metrics: Microsoft’s premium valuation is warranted, but Google’s numbers aren’t far behind. Much of Google’s discount came from regulatory overhang—but with that mostly resolved, the rerating case has never been stronger. The move from 22x to 28x earnings shows this rerating has already begun. For Google to command Amazon- and Microsoft-like multiples (35x+), investors must see these key developments: Given these risks, investors could consider the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap benchmark (S&P 500, S&P MidCap, and Russell 2000 blend). This quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap stocks offers a way to benefit from market upswings while cushioning downside risk, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics. Google’s path to a 50% stock price gain isn’t wishful thinking—it’s based on a valuation gap that’s increasingly hard to ignore. The company has all the right elements: dominant market position, improving AI story, regulatory clarity, and solid financials. The real question isn’t whether Google deserves a higher multiple, but how soon the market will acknowledge that it’s moved beyond the “search disruption” and antitrust concerns that kept its valuation muted. With AI proving to complement—not compete with—Google’s core business, we may be witnessing the early stages of a major rerating.
