Amazon (AMZN) is expected to release first-quarter results after the closing bell on Thursday, with analysts bullish on the online retail and tech giant. All 26 analysts tracked by Visible Alpha who follow the company rate Amazon's stock as a "buy," with every analyst holding a price target above the stock's current levels. The average price target is around $243, a premium of about 29% to Friday's close but down from about $259 ahead of last quarter's report. Amazon is expected to report $154.96 billion in revenue for the first quarter, up 8% from the first quarter a year ago. Adjusted earnings per share are expected to rise to $1.74 from $1.46 the same time last year. Amazon shares have declined about 14% since the start of the year, amid a tariff-fueled market sell-off that has hit the Magnificent Seven hard. Analysts will likely seek more information about Amazon's plans to keep up with the spending pace of its artificial intelligence rivals. But Wall Street's attention is also focused on the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs. Amazon stock was downgraded earlier this month by Raymond James analysts who said tariffs on China could hurt Amazon's profit margins and lead to a pullback in advertising revenue from sellers on the platform who rely on Chinese imports. Morgan Stanley analysts wrote recently that they estimate 18% of products on Amazon are imported from China, and that roughly 60% of third-party sellers on the platform have "some China exposure" that could affect ad spending plans.
