Title: Analyst Forecasts XRP To Stage Amazon-Like Rally To $200

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. XRP has drawn plenty of comparisons over the past few months, but one analyst believes the best way to understand its future is to look at Amazon’s past. Nick Anderson, better known as BULLRUNNERS on the social media platform X, says XRP is going through the same kind of consolidation Amazon faced in 2010, and it still has the potential to rally to $200. The key difference, however, is the patience investors will need before this rally can happen. XRP’s price action in the past seven days has been highlighted by a trading range between $2.8 and $2.9. The cryptocurrency now seems stuck within this range, but it has managed to hold above $2.8 for the meantime. Interestingly, Anderson likened this consolidation move to a similar retest of a previous high by the Amazon stock (AMZN) back in 2010. In his post, Anderson highlighted how Amazon stock spent roughly 3,800 days consolidating after the dot-com crash before finally breaking past its previous high and entering a meteoric run. However, before entering into this meteoric run, it consolidated for a few months in 2010 just after breaking above its previous high during the dot-com bubble. According to Anderson, XRP’s current structure is tracing out a massive cup and handle that mirrors this exact Amazon stock setup, with the cryptocurrency now using past highs as support in the same way Amazon did. Just as Amazon transformed once it cleared resistance, Anderson believes XRP could follow a similar breakout trajectory that could eventually push its price above $100, and possibly as high as $200. In his assessment, Anderson noted that this predicted rally to $200 might take many years to come to fruition. Comparing today’s price of around $2.80 to Amazon’s $5 launch point before its monumental rally, this would probably be the best time for XRP investors to accumulate for the long term. For younger investors, holding XRP for the next 10 to 15 years could prove transformative, with as little as 10,000 XRP amounting to $1 million in value if the cryptocurrency eventually climbs to $100. Despite his long-term forecast, Anderson is more cautious about what XRP might achieve this cycle. He stated that while a push to $100 in the near term would be “absolutely insane”, a more realistic target for this bull run could lie between $5 and $30. After that, he expects another correction to set in before the rally resumes sometime around the end of the decade. Anderson also left room for a more explosive scenario, noting that XRP could deliver what he called a “giga rally” if liquidity rushes into the market faster than expected. This is based on the growing anticipation around the adoption of ISO 20022 by the US Federal Reserve. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.81.

Title: ITS launches Single Stock ETF on shares of seven leading U.S. companies

September 04, 2025 02:05 ET | Source: ITS ITS ASTANA, Kazakhstan, Sept. 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The international trading platform ITS on September 3 launched trading in Kazakhstan’s first Single Stock ETFs, based on shares of seven leading U.S. companies. The introduction of this new instrument expands opportunities for portfolio diversification and investment in high-value assets. Single Stock ETFs allow investors to acquire fractional parts of highly liquid shares, making securities with high prices accessible to a broad range of participants. In practice, this means purchasing individual shares through a fund at one hundredth or one thousandth of the full share price. At the first stage, ITS offers Single Stock ETFs on shares of seven companies: Amazon (AMZN/100), a leader in e-commerce and cloud technologies; Tesla (TSLA/100), a manufacturer of electric vehicles and sustainable energy solutions; Netflix (NFLX/100), the largest streaming service; AMD (AMD/100), a developer of processors and graphics cards; MicroStrategy (MSTR/100), a provider of business analytics and institutional investor in Bitcoin; Coinbase (COIN/100), a leading U.S. crypto exchange; and Freedom Holding (FRHC/10000), an international investment company originating from the CIS. Each Single Stock ETF mirrors the price of one share and enables investors to start investing in equities with just a few cents or dollars. For example, an investor can buy one hundredth of a Tesla share for $3.29, with the full share closing at $329.36 on September 2, or one ten-thousandth of a Freedom Holding share for $0.015, with the share closing at $174.27. “We are offering one of the most advanced products on the market. This not only expands opportunities for investors but also makes our platform more attractive to new participants. We will continue to broaden our range of exchange-traded instruments to provide investors in Kazakhstan with the widest possible opportunities for investment,” said Chingiz Kanapyanov, CEO of ITS. Internationally, single-stock instruments are particularly popular among short-term traders who profit from volatility and among those seeking targeted diversification without purchasing full shares. On ITS, investments in single-stock ETFs provide a simple and transparent way to start investing. Trading is conducted in U.S. dollars, with income from these operations exempt from income tax in Kazakhstan. There are no management fees, as the fund is registered under the jurisdiction of the Astana International Financial Centre and listed on AIX. Investors are reminded that ETFs on individual shares carry market risks. Their value may rise or fall depending on the performance of the underlying share. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Investors are advised to review the fund documents and carefully assess potential risks before investing. About ITSITS is an international liquidity hub. Central to ITS's business model are the principles of best execution and smart order routing technology. These principles enable investors to execute securities transactions at the best prices available on the global financial market, regardless of the transaction volume. This technology ensures that the liquidity for foreign securities on ITS matches that of leading international platforms where these securities are traded. ITS Central Securities Depository Limited, the central depository for ITS, offers depository services for the storage and settlement of securities. The depository has received Qualified Intermediary with primary withholding responsibility (WQI) status from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Operating a clearing house that acts as a Central Counterparty, ITS assumes the counterparty role for all obligations of clearing participants and manages the clearing process for transactions on the ITS trading platform. ITS also calculates its own indexes: the ITS World index (ITSW) and the ITS Shariah index (ITSS). Trading of the first ETF in Central Asia and Caucasus, pegged to the performance of ITS’s own index – ITS World (ticker: ITSW), began on ITS in November 2024, providing a wide range of investors with a convenient and balanced instrument for investing and trading with a low entry threshold. In January 2025, the ETF lineup expanded with the introduction of a fund based on the ITS Shariah Index. ITS's direct clients include professional securities market participants from Kazakhstan and other countries, such as financial intermediaries who are accredited and directly registered at the AIFC. Investors, both private individuals and legal entities, access trading through these financial intermediaries, such as brokers and banks.
