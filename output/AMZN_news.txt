For tech’s biggest players, this earnings season is starting to feel like a scene from the movie Jerry Maguire — and the “show me the money” demands aren’t working out any better than they did for Tom Cruise. Some analysts are even dubbing this the “show me the money” quarter, as Wall Street’s patience with massive AI spending begins to wear thin. A tech stock selloff deepened Thursday as investors confronted the mounting costs of Silicon Valley’s artificial intelligence ambitions. Microsoft (MSFT) stock plunged 6% and Facebook parent Meta (META) tumbled 4% after the companies reported earnings late Wednesday. And in after-hours trading Thursday following their own earnings releases, Amazon (AMZN) stock dropped more than 3% and Apple (AAPL) fell 2% — despite all four companies reporting strong quarterly profits. (Some of the stocks were edging back up in pre-market trading on Friday.) Almost two years after ChatGPT kicked off Silicon Valley’s AI gold rush, this week’s tech earnings revealed both the promise and the staggering price tag of the AI revolution. While companies reported significant gains from AI initiatives —Meta’s ad prices up 11%, Google Cloud revenue surging 35% to $11.4 billion, Amazon’s AWS growing 19% to $27.5 billion — their warnings about future spending sparked a broad market retreat. Meta expects capital expenditures of up to $40 billion next year, Microsoft cautioned about ongoing OpenAI losses and slowing cloud growth, and even Apple, making its first careful steps into AI with its Apple Intelligence rollout this week, saw investors retreat — despite record revenue of $94.9 billion. Tech executives’ unwavering faith in AI’s potential stands in stark contrast to investors’ growing anxiety about the costs. “First, it’s clear that there are a lot of new opportunities to use new AI advances to accelerate our core business that should have strong ROI over the next few years,” Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told investors. Amazon chief Andy Jassy struck a similar note: “I think we’ve proven over time that we can drive enough operating income and free cash flow to make this a very successful return on invested capital business. We expect the same thing will happen here with generative AI.” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella emphasized “AI-driven transformation.” And earlier in the week, Google (GOOGL) chief Sundar Pichai highlighted “extraordinary momentum.” But while tech leaders speak confidently about long-term returns, the market is increasingly focused on the short-term price tag of these ambitious visions. The mounting infrastructure costs, combined with uncertain timelines for returns, are testing investors’ patience with Silicon Valley’s spend-now-profit-later approach to innovation. Microsoft stock fell more than 6% on Thursday after executives predicted Azure’s growth would slow and warned of weaker expansion in its AI-powered cloud business. The guidance suggested that even for Microsoft, which has emerged as an early AI leader through its partnership with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, the path to AI profits may be longer and costlier than investors hoped. “AI-driven transformation is changing work, work artifacts, and workflow across every role, function, and business process,” said Nadella, whose company saw total revenue rise 16% to $65.6 billion. Microsoft’s overall cloud revenue climbed 22% to $38.9 billion, but the company expects growth in its intelligent cloud segment to slow to 18-20% next quarter. At Google parent Alphabet, Pichai pointed to new AI features in Search and Cloud as key growth drivers helping push revenue up 15% to $88.3 billion. Google Cloud’s profit jumped to $1.9 billion from $266 million a year earlier, suggesting the company is finding ways to monetize its AI investments. Meta leveraged AI to revitalize its core advertising business, with revenue jumping 19% to $40.6 billion. The company forecast fourth-quarter revenue between $45 billion and $48 billion, above analysts’ expectations. But CFO Susan Li warned of a “significant acceleration in infrastructure expense growth next year” due to the “back-end weighted nature” of 2024 capital expenditures and expanding AI infrastructure. The massive spending plans highlight how AI’s transformation of the tech industry remains in its early stages. While the technology is beginning to deliver measurable business results, tech giants are betting billions that the real payoff still lies ahead — and asking investors for patience. Goldman Sachs (GS) has recently expressed concerns that while AI has the potential for significant efficiency gains in certain areas, the high costs associated with developing and maintaining AI systems could outweigh the benefits in many cases — potentially making it more expensive than simply hiring human workers for certain tasks. With robust cash positions and strong core businesses, these companies appear able to sustain their AI investments even as costs mount. But the market reaction to Microsoft’s and Meta’s warnings serves as a reminder that even for tech’s strongest players, the AI revolution is proving to be an increasingly expensive proposition with an uncertain timeline for returns. Like Jerry Maguire’s demanding client in the 1996 film, Wall Street’s message to Silicon Valley is getting clearer by the day. As a Bank of America (BAC) report puts it: “We expect AI to transition from a ‘tell me’ to a ‘show me’ story, with any disconnect between investments and revenue generation to come under increased scrutiny.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: The American Consumer’s Surprising Strength

What’s surprised most economists this year hasn’t been the magnitude and direction of rate cuts, but rather the resilience of the American consumer. Spending has continued to be robust, despite elevated rates pressuring pocketbooks. We believe consumer spending will continue, even though credit card debt levels have risen and excess Covid era savings appear to be spent. In fact, we believe there’s a possibility consumer spending could surprise to the upside. Wealthier Americans with lower debt-to-income ratios are positioned well to sustain or increase their spending patterns. This group is responsible for a majority of American discretionary spending. Furthermore, while lower-income households face some stress right now, their financial conditions are poised to loosen as rates come down and inflation comes under control. If the outlook on the consumer starts to shift, we could see consumer discretionary names start to become investment opportunities. In particular we would point to retail businesses who have spent time building brand loyalty and catering to evolving consumer preferences. Over time these discretionary business models can become American staples. NEW YORK - AUGUST 5: Beverage cups featuring the logo of Starbucks Coffee are seen in the new ... [+] flagship store on 42nd Street August 5, 2003 in New York City. The Seattle-based coffee company has emerged as the largest food chain in the Manhattan borough of New York with 150 outlets. (Photo by Stephen Chernin/Getty Images) The first thing most people look at when talking about consumer health is credit card balances. Credit card debt in the U.S. reached $1.14 trillion in Q2 2024, a record high. However, while credit card balances are at all-time highs, it’s important to note that consumer debt service payments, excluding mortgages, make up 5.6% of disposable income – a number that’s in line with historical averages. If consumer debt grows in-line with GDP and incomes, then the all-time highs are a natural by-product of our nation’s record-setting growth coming out of the pandemic. Record high credit card debts are okay if they’re growing in line with the rest of the economy and debt service costs are manageable. Also worth noting is the composition of spending. While lower-income households carry a much higher credit card balance relative to their income, wealthier Americans are generally the primary driver of consumer spending. This groups ability to spend remains relatively healthy. High income households have seen a 17% increase in inflation adjusted retail spending since 2018. This is important because the top income quintile makes up 40% of personal consumption, and personal consumption makes up approximately 60% of domestic GDP. Lower income households are under more pressure. Their spending has still risen since 2018, middle income up 13.3% and lower income by 7.9%, but the spending growth lags that of their wealthier peers. This group is burdened by relatively heavier debt loads and are more exposed to inflationary pressures. Price increases have eroded their purchasing power, and rate hikes have hampered these groups’ access to credit. However, these groups are starting to see some light at the end of the tunnel. Inflation appears to be moderating, with core PCE at 2.7% in September. Wage growth is also moderating, but not as quickly. Real wage growth was back in positive territory in September, clocking in at 1.8%. Furthermore, positive wage growth was especially strong for moderate wage earners. Finally, with inflation abating the Fed can finally start to reduce interest rates, bringing a degree of debt relief to millions of Americans carrying credit card balances or other adjustable rate debts. SAN FRANCISCO - FEBRUARY 09: A sign stands outside of a McDonald's restaurant February 9, 2009 in ... [+] San Francisco, California. Fast food chain restaurant McDonald's reported a 7.1 percent increase in same store sales for January as people look towards cheaper food alternatives in the weakening economy. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) The American consumer has been under stress, but it’s not like they stopped spending completely. We believe brands that have tried to work with the stressed consumer through this recent period of instability stand to benefit significantly as the tide for the consumer begins to turn. Think about a company like McDonald’s (MCD) – to attract customers wanting a better deal eating out, they’ve had to rely extensively on promotional offers. These promotional offers aren’t big profit engines, but the traffic during hard times helps build brand familiarity and form habits. When times are better and consumers can afford more, McDonald’s benefits from having expanded their consumer base. This kind of growth in bad times sets up the company for success when the economy is expanding. Companies like McDonalds are also trying to innovate to cement their position in a consumer’s lives by rolling out loyalty rewards programs and gamified applications. Businesses are willing to offer discounts or promotions through their apps because it helps build consumer habits and the data the businesses can get back about app usage gives them valuable information about which discounts or promotions are effective. Building habits and establishing a consistent customer base is key for helping companies sell more product, expand into new markets, and overcome disruptions to their consumer base or to their business model. Providing the customer with value and consistency also sometimes requires simplicity. Focused marketing and a simple product can be a really effective way to build brand loyalty. Take Chipotle (CMG) and Starbucks (SBUX) for example – CEO Brian Niccol took the reins of the global coffee chain in September and has preached simplicity. A simpler and cheaper menu. An app that’s easier to navigate. A reversion back to being the neighborhood coffee shop. It’s just a simple focus on coffee! Before Starbucks, Niccol took Chipotle’s stock to all-time highs with its cost-efficient and customizable menu – all while limiting the complexity of actually making a burrito. Minimalism kept internal costs down and allowed the company to offer a better product at a better price. Keeping it simple and consistent can help consumers feel like they’re not splurging on lunch or their morning coffee and can lead to recession-proof earnings for the underlying businesses. Positioning yourself as a value option with a simple business model can also work outside of the food and beverage space. Look at apparel retailers. They have also benefited from a shift to preferences for value amid rising costs, especially among Gen Z and millennial shoppers. Retail stores where consumers can “trade down” are essential to maintaining consumer spending when times get tough. Think about companies like TJX Companies (TJX) and Burlington (BURL) – clothing retailers who have been taking market share from department stores for years and continue to look more like consumer staples rather than being discretionary names. Retail isn’t even close to dead here, as shoppers can still pick out branded items but at a steep discount. Where American’s aren’t opting for cost savings, they are opting for convenience. Think about mini splurges like ordering take out. DoorDash Inc (DASH) has continued to see robust growth among its users even as the broader economy has faced spending challenges. There are two angles to the success. First, on the consumer side, food delivery apps are becoming normalized. It’s becoming habitual, just like a morning stop at the local coffee shop. This habit building starts with meal orders, but the opportunity set for companies in the space is much wider. They’re solving last mile logistics for everything from meals to groceries to pharmaceutical goods to packages. Second, on the worker side of the equation, the gig-economy gives people another way to earn a bit of money to fund their habits. It doesn’t have the commitment of a second job and it’s flexible, but still gives people an easy way to earn money when times would otherwise be tough. Finally, it’s important to be cognizant of how broad the consumer space is. Not every company that has a consumer facing arm is necessarily dependent on the consumer for its growth. A prime example of this would be a company like Amazon (AMZN). Amazon is a huge consumer shopping platform so it gets categorized as a consumer discretionary type of name. But someone like Amazon also has other divisions. In particular, Amazon’s AWS division is one of the largest hyperscale cloud providers in the world and consistently generates a substantial portion of the company’s operating income – a far cry from being a simple consumer oriented e-commerce business. On the other hand, a company like an American Express or Visa get classified as financials, but they still depend on consumer spending and on brand loyalty to make money. We think businesses offering discounts to Americans burdened by higher inflation and interest expenses are likely to keep building loyalty among their customers. Building loyalty now should pay off in the future when the consumer’s financial situation begins to improve. Furthermore, businesses need to streamline and adapt to new consumer preferences for value and convenience. Investors should keep a close eye on businesses with the potential to break away from dependency on the economic cycle and which assert themselves as American staples. One Community. Many Voices.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. The Nasdaq led a tumble in US stocks on Thursday after Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) earnings sparked worries about prospects for Big Techs amid rising artificial intelligence costs. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) sank 2.7%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell nearly 1.9%, as both indexes ended the month slightly in the red. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) also notched a monthly loss after dropping 0.9% on Thursday. The monthly declines snapped five straight months of gains for the S&P 500 and Dow. Optimism for a Big Tech boost to stocks took a knock as investors digested Meta's and Microsoft's quarterly reports. While the results beat Wall Street estimates, both companies flagged that they will step up already high spending on AI infrastructure. Concerns that would put pressure on profitability helped send shares in both Meta and Microsoft lower. The unsettled mood spread to Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL), which rounded off this week's "Magnificent Seven" earnings with reports after the close on Thursday. AI darling Nvidia (NVDA) also fell over 4.5%. After the bell, the mood around Amazon improved, as its stock popped after the tech giant topped Wall Street's estimates for both revenue and earnings per share. Meanwhile, Apple shares slid slightly as a one-time charge related to the reversal of a European General Court decision weighed on the company's earnings per share. On the macroeconomic front, investors received the latest reading on the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, which largely matched expectations. The reading is the last key inflation input for the Federal Reserve before its policy decision next week. Read more: What the Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards In jobs-related data, initial jobless claims declined to a five-month low of 216,000, lower than estimates. Next up is the all-important jobs report on Friday. Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley reports: Apple (AAPL) announced its fourth quarter earnings on Thursday, giving Wall Street its first look at whether the company’s Apple Intelligence platform is juicing iPhone sales. For the quarter, Apple saw earnings per share (EPS) of $0.97 on revenue of $94.9 billion. The company says it saw a one-time charge related to the reversal of a European General Court decision that requires Apple to pay 13 billion euros to Ireland for back taxes. Without the charge, EPS would have come in at $1.64. That would have blown past expectations of $1.59 per share and revenue of $94.3 billion. The company reported EPS of $1.46 on revenue of $89.4 billion during the same period last year. Read more here. Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley reports: Intel (INTC) reported its Q3 earnings after the bell on Thursday beating expectations on revenue, but falling short on earnings per share due to impairment charges. But positive Q4 guidance and a beat on data center revenue helped send the stock higher by as much as 12% following the report. For the quarter, Intel saw a loss per share of $0.46 on revenue of $13.28 billion. Analysts were anticipating a loss per share of $0.03 on revenue of $13 billion. That’s down from the earnings of $0.41 per share and revenue of $14.1 billion the company saw in the same quarter last year. Read more here. Amazon (AMZN) stock popped as much as 5% after the company reported stronger revenue and earnings per share for the third quarter than Wall Street expected. The company also said it expects revenue in a range of $181.5 billion to $188.5 billion in the fourth quarter. Analysts had forecasted $186.36 billion in revenue for the quarter. Meanwhile, Amazon said Operating income is expected to be between $16.0 billion and $20.0 billion during the fourth quarter. Wall treet had projected $17.49 billion. Read more here. Big Tech led Thursday's losses, with all three averages ending lower. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) sank 2.7%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell nearly 1.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) notched a monthly loss, dropping 0.9%. All three averages closed out October slightly in the red. Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) earnings sparked worries about prospects for Big Tech amid rising artificial intelligence costs, with those stocks losing more than 4% and 6%, respectively. All of the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks fell, with Al chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) dropping more than 4.5%. A slew of tech earnings are set to hit the tape again after the bell. Below is what Wall Street is expecting: Amazon: Amazon is expected to report earnings per share of $1.16 on revenue of $157.29 billion. Read the full preview. Apple: For the quarter, Wall Street expects Apple to report earnings per share (EPS) of $1.59 on revenue of $94.3 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Read the full preview. Intel: For the quarter, Intel is expected to report a loss per share of $0.03 on revenue of $13 billion. That’s down from the earnings of $0.41 per share and revenue of $14.1 billion the company saw in the same quarter last year. Read the full preview. Both Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) topped Wall Street's estimates for revenue and earnings per share. But both also talked about ramping up spending on artificial intelligence, which appeared to weigh on sentiment as each stock slumped about 5% on Thursday. Microsoft's capital expenditures picked up to $20 billion in the most recent quarter from $19 billion the quarter prior. CFO Amy Hood said the company is ramping up investments in response to "AI demands." The company did, however, note that the extra spend is weighing on Microsoft's margins. For its part, Meta raised the lower end of its guidance range for full-year capital expenditures from $37 billion to $38 billion, and CFO Susan Li made a rather ambiguous statement about spending plans moving forward, saying the company expects "significant capital expenditure growth in 2025." The chart below shows a clear trend in growing capital expenditures. The companies say it's going to drive future revenues. For now, the market appears not to love it. But whether it will work in the long run remains a looming question that doesn't have a clear answer. RBC Capital analyst Rishi Jaluria wrote about Microsoft on Thursday, “While investors may be hung up on the optics of decelerating Azure growth paired with substantial CapEx, we see a path to upward revisions, and would be a buyer on weakness." The October jobs report is expected to show job gains slowed significantly during the month as recent hurricanes and a strike by Boeing workers weigh on the labor market. The monthly report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, slated for release at 8:30 a.m. ET on Friday, is expected to show nonfarm payrolls rose by 105,000 in October while the unemployment rate held flat at 4.1%, according to consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg. This would mark the lowest monthly number of job additions since December 2020. In September, the US economy shocked Wall Street by adding 254,000 jobs, well above consensus estimates. The unemployment rate declined to 4.1%. Here are the key numbers Wall Street will be looking at on Friday morning compared to the previous month, according to data from Bloomberg: Read more here. Yahoo Finance's Claire Boston reports: Mortgage rates rose for a fifth straight week as pre-election volatility continued to rock the bond market. The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 6.72% in the week through Wednesday, according to Freddie Mac data, up from 6.54% a week earlier. 15-year mortgage rates also increased to 5.99% from 5.71% a week ago. Read more here. Technology stocks led the overall market declines on Thursday. The S&P 500 Technology Sector (XLK) ETF slid 2.8% by mid-session. AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) was down more than 4% along with other semiconductor stocks. Among Big Tech's declinersoftware giant Microsoft (MSFT) fell more than 5% following its quarterly results. Social media company Meta (META) fell roughly 4% after indicating it will step up spending on AI infrastructure next year. Amazon (AMZN), set to report earnings after the bell, also dropped more than 3%. Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) extended its double-digit declines on Thursday as the stock reversed sizable gains from earlier in the week. Shares fell around 15% and trading was briefly halted due to volatility. As Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal reports, the massive swings come as the stock suffered its largest percent decline on Wednesday after shares plunged around 22%. Since Tuesday, more than $3 billion has been shaved from the company's market cap, although the stock is still up roughly 130% from its September lows. Read more here. Super Micro Computer (SMCI) stock dropped nearly 14%, extending declines of 33% in the prior session to erase all of its year-to-date gains, as some Wall Street analysts backed away from covering the stock after accounting firm Ernst & Young resigned during the company's audit. On Thursday, Argus downgraded the server maker to Hold from Buy, with no price target. Meanwhile analysts at Needham and Wells Fargo suspended coverage of the company. Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal reports: Comcast (CMCSA) said Thursday that it has started exploring spinning off its cable networks into a separate company. The development comes as the media industry undergoes massive disruption, with more consumers cutting the cord, or dropping their pay-TV packages. Comcast stock rose more than 2% on Thursday morning. Read more here. Stocks accelerated their losses on Thursday as the Nasdaq (^IXIC) dropped as much as 2% with technology sliding. Among the biggest laggards, Nvidia (NVDA) sank 4% while Microsoft (MSFT) and Broadcom (AVGO) also fell 4%. Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian reports: Stellantis (STLA) reported third quarter revenue and shipments that missed estimates, though the company said it's making "progress addressing operational issues." The stock gained more than 3% in early trading on Thursday. Read more here. Tech stocks led the major averages lower on Thursday following quarterly results from social media giant Meta (META) and software maker Microsoft (MSFT). The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) sank 0.7%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell over 0.7%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) dropped roughly 0.5%. Meta said it would increase capital spending significantly in 2025, while Microsoft's cloud growth forecast disappointed Wall Street as the company races to expand its AI infrastructure. Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) stocks sank premarket as investors weighed their hefty artificial intelligence expenditures against the time it will take to generate a return on their investment. Meta fell as much as 4.7% before paring losses, while Microsoft was down 3.6%. During their earnings reports the night before, both companies beat Wall Street’s expectations, but Microsoft’s weaker-than-expected sales guidance for the current quarter and Meta’s raised outlook on capital expenditures appeared to spook investors. Meta raised the lower end of its guidance range for full-year spending from $37 billion to $38 billion, and CFO Susan Li said the company expects “significant capital expenditure growth in 2025.” Microsoft indicated in its fiscal first quarter earnings reports that spending on general artificial intelligence infrastructure (e.g., AI chips) weighed on gross margins, which it expects to continue in the current period. Microsoft justified the spending by saying the demand for its AI products is real and that infrastructure spending is necessary to continue to meet that demand. “Roughly half of our cloud and AI-related spend continues to be for long-lived assets that will support monetization over the next 15 years and beyond,” said Microsoft CFO Amy Hood. Meta said it’s seeing “rapid adoption of Meta AI.” RBC Capital analyst Rishi Jaluria said to buy the dip on Microsoft: “While investors may be hung up on the optics of decelerating Azure growth paired with substantial CapEx, we see a path to upward revisions.” Analysts also reiterated their Buy ratings on Meta stock. Economic data: Core PCE index, (September); Initial & Continuing jobless claims, (week ending Oct. 26); Employment cost index, (third quarter); Challenger jobs cuts, (October); Personal income & Spending, (September) Earnings: Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Conoco Phillips (COP), Estée Lauder (EL), Kellanova (K), Intel (INTC), Mastercard (MA), Norwegian Cruise Lines(NCLH), Peloton (PTON), Merck (MRK), SiriusXM (SIRI), Comcast (CMCSA); Uber (UBER) Here are some of the biggest stories you may have missed overnight and early this morning: Microsoft stock slides as investors weigh earnings Meta beats, but stock falls on heavy spending plans Peloton names former Apple exec as CEO to steer turnaround 'Shadow campaigns': Microsoft-Google legal feud heats up Merck beats Q3 expectations, but China Gardasil sales lag Tesla chipmaker STMicro trims revenue outlook for 3rd time Gold climbs to record amid US election jitters Starbucks (SBUX) shares are indicating a slightly higher open today despite more details about the dreadful quarter the company preannounced last week. And I will tell you why: new CEO Brian Niccol. I have known Niccol for about 10 years, going back to his time leading Taco Bell at Yum! Brands (YUM). One thing among many that I have noticed about him is how he really digs into problems and calmly articulates them — and an action plan — to team members and investors. That was the same Niccol who senior reporter Brooke DiPalma and I encountered last night in a 15-minute post-earnings call phone chat. Such calm under fire will prove to be a good thing for Starbucks, as it has many, many problems to address. Niccol seemingly has more knowledge about Starbucks in his first three months than the prior CEO gained in more than a year! He is wasting no time fixing things at Starbucks, as Brooke reports here. But here is one exchange I had with him on the phone regarding the need to slash the menu size by 25% or more. Cutting the Starbucks menu down is vitally important to driving a better business on the top and bottom lines. It's good to see Niccol understand this (he made it a point to keep the Chipotle (CMG) menu small, carefully introducing a new item or two a year after thorough testing), as his predecessors never did.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 250 points Thursday mid-morning, alongside sharp Nasdaq and S&P 500 declines, following earnings reports from Microsoft (MSFT+0.98%) and Meta (META-0.08%), as both tech giants grapple with challenges in meeting the surging demand for AI. Meta stock fell about 3% in Thursday trading, while Microsoft stock dropped more than 5%. Super Micro Computer (SMCI-10.53%) stock continued to fall following the resignation of Ernst & Young, the company’s auditor, and now it faces potential delisting from the Nasdaq Shares of crypto-friendly companies like Coinbase (COIN+2.01%), MicroStrategy (MSTR-6.12%), and Robinhood (HOOD+2.09%) also slipped after releasing their earnings a day earlier. In afternoon trading, the Dow was down 248 points, or 0.5%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq slumped 421 points, or 2.2%. The S&P 500 was down 1.4%. Positive news on the economic front came in the form of a significant drop in U.S. initial unemployment claims to a five-month low, indicating a resilient labor market. The Labor Department reported Thursday that initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell by 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 216,000 for the week ending Oct. 26, surpassing economists’ expectations of 230,000 claims. And inflation continues to cool, as the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index — the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge — showed a 2.1% year-over-year increase for September, down from 2.3% in August, according to data released Thursday. This inflation slowdown, almost all the way to the Fed’s target of 2% annual inflation, was a hopeful signal for consumers and the Fed alike as it plans to continue cutting interest rates. Investors will be watching Apple (AAPL-1.28%) and Amazon (AMZN+6.19%) earnings after the closing bell. Apple’s (AAPL-1.28%) fourth-quarter report Thursday will be the first glimpse into sales since Apple unveiled its latest slate of iPhones and new artificial intelligence features, known as Apple Intelligence, at its annual event in early September — and Wall Street is expecting a strong quarter of yearly growth. Analysts are expecting earnings per share of $1.60 for Apple’s fourth fiscal quarter, according to estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS+1.05%). Net income is projected to reach $24.24 billion, which would represent more than 5% growth from the same period a year ago. Apple has had a strong year over all. Its shares are up about 25% year-to-date, just beating the S&P 500 index. Amazon is set to report third-quarter earnings on Thursday, after slightly missing expectations in its last quarter. The retail and cloud giant is expected to report revenues of $157.3 billion for the quarter ended in September, according to analyst estimates compiled by FactSet. Amazon is expected to report earnings per share, or EPS, of $1.14. In the last quarter, the company issued lower-than-expected guidance for the third quarter, setting revenue expectations between $154 and $158.5 billion — or between 8% and 11% year over year growth. In the second quarter, Amazon reported revenues of $148 billion — a 10% increase from the previous year, but still below expectations of $148.7 billion, according to FactSet. However, the company reported net income of $13.5 billion in the second quarter, which was above expectations of $11 billion. Amazon Web Services, Amazon’s cloud-computing division, reported $26.3 billion in revenue, which was up 19% year over year. – Rocio Fabbro and Britney Nguyen contributed to this article.

Amazon's third-quarter earnings beat estimates and it gave strong guidance for the current quarter on Thursday, sending shares up after the closing bell. Net sales for Q3 hit $158.9 billion, outperforming the consensus analyst estimate of $157.3 billion, and Amazon also forecast sales for its current quarter of $181.5 billion to $188.5 billion, compared to an estimated $186.36 billion. The tech titan beat on EPS, too. Big Tech companies have come under increasing scrutiny recently to demonstrate that the billions of dollars they've been spending over the last few years on AI infrastructure are starting to deliver returns. During the investor call, CEO Jassy said Amazon plans to spend over $75 billion in 2025, the majority in its key AWS cloud computing unit. Jassy said the increase is driven by generative AI and that customers and shareholders will feel good about it in the long term. AI "is a really unusually large, maybe once-in-a-lifetime type of opportunity," he said. On the retail side, Amazon's CFO Brian Olsavsky said that "Prime remains a core contributor" to growth this year. Paid membership growth in the US and internationally continued to rise in the third quarter, he said, helped by Prime Day events in July. While the company didn't really comment on the state of the US consumer, Olsavsky said Amazon's "faster delivery speeds" are helping fuel growth in purchases of everyday items. Amazon's stock climbed as much as 6% in volatile after-hours trading shortly after the results. Despite a sharp 3.3% drop during regular trading on Thursday, the stock is still up 23% so far in 2024. Jassy didn't say much about the state of the consumer, but he did say Amazon's "speed of delivery" offers significant advantages to customers. "The faster that we're able to promise customers that we can get them their items, the more frequently they buy," Jassy said. "And then more they actually use Amazon for their shopping needs." Amazon said some consumers are trading down and orders of everyday essentials are growing. Those everyday essentials "are really predicated on speed." he said. Amazon gave a peek at its key capex plans. It expects to spend about $75 billion in 2024 and more than that in 2025. Jassy the said majority of that spending in 2025 will be for AWS. "The increased bumps here are really driven by generative AI, as I was mentioning my own opening comments," Jassy said. Jassy said that AI "is a really unusually large, maybe once in a lifetime type of opportunity," but "customers, the business and our shareholders will feel good about this long term." "I think we've proven over time, that we can drive enough operating income and free cash flow to make this a very successful return on invested capital business," Jassy said. "And we expect the same thing will happen here with generative AI." Paid membership growth accelerated in the third quarter in the US and internationally, Amazon CFO Brian T. Olsavsky said in the call. As of March, the share of US consumers who have Amazon Prime was about 75%, Bloomberg reported. Jassy said new Kindle sales "significantly outperformed" expectations. "Kindle is having an excellent year with customers reading more than ever," Jassy said. "We now have over 20 billion average monthly pages read on Kindle devices worldwide." Amazon's AI business is a "multi billion dollar business that's growing triple digit percentages year over year," Jassy says. It's "growing three times faster at its stage of evolution than AWS did itself." Jassy also says that while the company has a "deep partnership" with Nvidia, customers want better price performance for AI workloads. Jassy says the company is seeing "significant interest" in its custom silicon chips. Jassy mentions a number of its own AI offerings including the expansion of Amazon's shopping assistant Rufus, AI shopping guides, and Project Amelia. "We're seeing meaningful growth in a very large base," Jassy said. "We see further opportunity in driving even better performance for advertisers, further improving the relevancy of the ads we show, and by providing additional optimization controls." Amazon's head of IR kicks off the call before handing it over to Andy Jassy, who recaps the earnings report. "As always, we're focused on making our customers' lives better and easier and thinking long-term with respect to how we can keep helping customers and build a successful business," Jassy said. Truist Securities said in a note to investors that Amazon is expected to discuss four key topics during the call: the health of the consumer leading up to the holidays, AWS headed into the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2025, North America and international operating margins, and management's thoughts on capital expenditures heading into 2025. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy highlighted the company's October Prime Days in the report. "We kicked off the holiday season with our biggest-ever Prime Big Deal Days and the launch of an all-new Kindle lineup that is significantly outperforming our expectations," he said, saying the company is excited about what's in store for customers during the key holiday shopping period. "Amazon continues to be the primary beneficiary of the US consumer's shift to online shopping and a healthy Prime Day helped boost revenues for the retail and ad businesses," EMARKETER analyst Canaves said. He also said Amazon would share information about "over 100 new cloud infrastructure and AI capabilities" at an AWS re:Invent event the week after Thanksgiving. EMARKETER principal analyst Sky Canaves told BI Amazon beat expectations "on the strength of the three pillars of its business: ecommerce, advertising, and cloud services." While Amazon has had to increase AI-related spending, Canaves said it is in a good spot since it has been steadily growing "AWS capacity and faces fewer constraints." 3rd quarter Net sales: $158.88 billion, +11% y/y, estimate $157.29 billion Operating income: $17.41 billion, +56% y/y, estimate $14.75 billion 4th quarter Source: Bloomberg Amazon fell as much as 3.9% on Thursday and was trading 3.5% lower as of 3:25 p.m. in New York. Morgan Stanley suggested that investors stick with Amazon, even if the firm's fourth-quarter guidance might disappoint. Analysts led by Brian Nowak suggested that the company's outlook regarding earnings before interest and taxes could underwhelm investors, given ongoing retail-side pressures. "We see AMZN's high and growing focus on lower-priced, lower-margin essentials driving merchandise margin pressure... which is holding back the near-term slope of its N. America retail profit ramp. Expected discounting in a competitive holiday season (and picky discretionary consumer) create further near-term uncertainty," they said. The bank expects fourth-quarter EBIT of around $17.5 billion, 1% below consensus expectations. This could create some weakness in the stock. However, Morgan Stanley is treating that as an opportunity to buy, as 2025 will unleash multiple profit drivers. That includes Amazon's transition into high-margin ad revenue, as well as upcoming corporate and shipping efficiencies. As with Wedbush Securities, Morgan Stanley doesn't project a meaningful profit impact from Amazon's latest investments, such as Project Kuiper. The bank holds a $210 price target, indicating 13% upside ahead. Wedbush Securities sees two key reasons to celebrate Amazon over the long term: its expanding cloud platform and a revenue shift toward high-margin advertising. "We think the risk/reward is attractive heading into results as investor expectations for 2H profitability have moderated, AWS growth continues to accelerate, and advertising momentum is building into 2025," a team of analysts led by Scott Devitt wrote. Alongside growing cost efficiencies and Amazon's broadening supply chain, AWS and ad revenue will lead significant margin expansion over the next five years. According to Wedbush, investors should take advantage of today's relative underperformance. Instead, Wall Street has pulled back profit expectations amid near-term uncertainty related to Amazon's newest investments, the firm noted. But while initiatives such as Project Kuiper — Amazon's plan to deploy thousands of satellites — may add on costs, Wedbush doesn't expect these to have a meaningful impact on the upcoming results. The firm reiterated its "outperform" rating and $225 price target, implying a 20% increase from current levels. Amazon's third-quarter results will be a mixed bag as consensus revenue estimates are too high, says Bank of America. BofA's Justin Post expects revenue to underwhelm at $157 billion, but predicts that investors underestimate Amazon's operating profits, which should reach $15 billion. The analyst cited AI-driven cloud demand as a top reason to hold Amazon, and noted that accelerating AWS growth might surprise Wall Street. "AI demand likely improved further in 3Q, and we think investors may be expecting 20% y/y growth for 3Q, which would suggest the largest 3Q in terms of sequential dollars added at $1.39bn," Post said. While shifts in consumer spending will remain in place, retail margin growth could reaccelerate in the second half of 2025. The firm has a "buy" rating on the stock and a $210 price target, which implies a nearly 13% gain from current levels. CFRA analyst Arun Sundaram is cautious about Amazon's near-term trajectory, even if the company has compelling prospects over the long run. The firm expects Amazon to notch a "modest" earnings beat after the bell: it predicts revenue to rise 10.5% year-over-year and GAAP operating profit to climb 36%. While AWS and advertising momentum work in Amazon's favor, Sundaram will monitor how the firm's other investments affect profits. Though growth in other parts of Amazon's business should cover these investments, CFRA expects profits to expand more moderately into 2025. CFRA also cited that Amazon is experiencing a tepid spending environment as consumers shift to lower-priced products. The company trimmed its Amazon price target to $219 a share on October 21, indicating 17% upside ahead. JPMorgan highlighted Amazon Web Services, the firm's cloud computing system, as a chief reason to stay bullish on the stock. AWS will continue accelerating through 2025, aided by optimizations, new workload migrations, and Amazon's growing monetization of artificial intelligence. The bank predicts AWS grew 21% year over year, surpassing Wall Street expectations. JPMorgan expects third-quarter net sales to reach $157 billion, falling under consensus estimates of $157.3 billion. Retail profits were likely pressured in the last quarter amid spending headwinds, including Prime Day discounts. According to the bank, consumers have turned cautious on discretionary items, while indicating a preference for deals. Together, these factors have depressed Amazon's average selling prices. JPMorgan has an "overweight" rating on Amazon and a $230 price target. This suggests nearly 23% upside from current levels. 3rd quarter Net sales estimate: $157.29 billion Operating income estimate: $14.75 billion 4th quarter Correction: October 31, 2024 — Amazon expects to have around $75 billion in capital expenditures this year, not $75 million.

Title: Increasing Ways To Get AI Investment Exposure

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has clearly been the dominant investment theme of 2024 and is the next major technology wave. According to IDC, spending on AI will be in excess of $631 billion by 2028. With ever increasing interest and spending in AI, there are also a rising number of ways to participate in this massive theme. ETF baskets are a great way to gain exposure. Just this week, the world’s largest asset manager, Blackrock, launched two new ETFs, the iShares A.I. Innovation and Tech Active ETF (BAI) and the iShares Technology Opportunities Active ETF (TEK). There are likely many more on the way. However, not all are created equal. Some of the beneficiaries of AI may not be immediately obvious. These include Data Center REITs like Digital Realty Trust (DLR) and Equinix (EQIX) as well as companies that are involved with the construction the infrastructure for data centers as represented in the ETF PAVE. Also, the need to generate increased electrical production in the U.S. has had a positive effect on Utilities. In addition, nuclear power is making a comeback in the U.S. Hence, uranium stocks are performing better as one can see in the performance of URA. Stronger Performing AI Beneficiary ETFs: Figure 1: Weekly Charts of Leading AI-Related ETFs Weaker Performing AI Beneficiary ETFs: Figure 2: Weekly Charts of Lagging AI-Related ETFs Broad Market ETFs: Figure 3: Weekly Charts of the Above Two ETFs There are many use cases for AI, most relating to costs savings and efficiency/productivity gains across nearly every sector. Some of the larger being search assistance, automated machine learning, data-driven marketing, fraud/network intrusion detection, financial robo-advisory, supply chain optimization, factory automation, self-driving technology, drug discovery, and more recently generative AI, among others. There will be many opportunities in those companies that can harness the technologies. But we would like to now take a closer look at some of the beneficiaries of all of the spending happening to create the necessary infrastructure, in particular the powering of all of the growing use cases: data centers. In terms of data centers, according to industry estimates, the market size could rise from around $200B in 2022 to nearly $450B by 2028. McKinsey notes that electricity demand from data centers is expected to rise by over 150% by 2030. It usage will rise from under 2% compared to total installed capacity to >4% over the period. While it is a small portion, it is still a huge amount of new power needed. Hyperscalers like Alphabet, Meta, Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft, and Oracle (ORCL) account for around 40% of the data center capacity. Non-hyperscalers (colocation) account for ~25% and on premise for the remainder. Figure 4: Growth in Data Center Electricity Demand As we mentioned in our May Forbes article, “Power Up Your Portfolio With Utilities,” United States overall electricity demand should rise +1 to 3% a year for the next decade. Current estimates could continue to rise. Other more aggressive estimates put the percentage of electricity consumption from data centers in the high-single digits by 2030. Recent power supply deals from Microsoft and Alphabet underscore the coming growth, as well as the continued need to shift towards clean energy sources. Although the Nasdaq 100 and Mega Cap growth groups were huge outperformers over about an 18-month period from the beginning of 2023, they have trailed off in relative terms recently. There has been a shift in leadership from the spenders (hyperscalers) as the leaders to the infrastructure product and services, and energy providers, particularly related to data centers. Below are 25 O’Neil Industry Groups related in some way to data centers, detailed with some price performance and other metrics. Nearly all have been winners over the trailing 52 weeks, however, over eight to 13 weeks, there is a large separation between the top few and the rest. Figure 5: List of O’Neil Industry Groups Related to Data Centers In Conclusion The AI revolution offers many exciting investment opportunities beyond simply semiconductors and software. In particular, companies that construct, operate, and power data centers are likely to be strong beneficiaries of this massive trend. We encourage investors to explore these areas in greater detail as we believe many of these stocks will be market leaders over the next decade.­­ Kenley Scott, Director, Global Sector Strategist at William O’Neil + Co., made significant contributions to the data compilation, analysis, and writing for this article.

Title: BXP Touts 25% Year-Over-Year Increase in Leasing Activity in Third Quarter

Time Published: 2024-10-30T17:28:48Z

© 2024 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy Boston-based developer, owner and manager BXP touted a boost in its leasing so far this year, as leasing activity grew by 25 percent in the first three quarters of 2024 compared to the same period last year. During the third quarter, BXP — formerly known as Boston Properties — signed 74 leases totaling more than 1.1 million square feet with an average term of 7.2 years. “Our performance in the third quarter demonstrated BXP continued resilience and provided evidence of property and capital market recovery,” BXP Chairman and CEO Owen Thomas said on the company’s third-quarter earnings call Wednesday. “Interest rates, corporate earnings, return to the office behavior, outperformance of premier workplaces and valuation in the public and private markets are all currently working in our favor.” The growing return-to-office movement has been a particular boon to BXP’s leasing activity, Thomas said on the call. And that doesn’t appear to be slowing, especially when you consider giant employers such as Amazon (AMZN), Starbucks and Salesforce have all recently initiated some kind of mandatory return-to-office policy for white-collar workers. Indeed, some 83 percent of global CEOs are predicting a full — pre-COVID-19 style — return to office within the next three years, according to 2024 KMPG data. “Asking rents for premier workplaces are 50 percent higher than the broader market,” Thomas said, noting that “approximately 90 percent of our [net operating income] comes from assets located in [central business districts] that are predominantly premier workplaces. The CBD assets are 90.1 percent occupied and 92.1 percent leased as of the end of the third quarter.” When it comes to the New York City market, BXP is still searching for an anchor tenant for its planned office tower at 343 Madison Avenue. But earlier this month BXP broke ground — alongside the Metropolitan Transportation Authority — on a new Grand Central Terminal entrance that will be accessible from the building’s concourse. “When complete, the building will comprise 942,000 square feet, and include state-of-the-art sustainability features, as well as direct escalator access into Grand Central Terminal,” Thomas said on the call. “We hope to launch this approximately $2 billion project next year.” For the first three quarters of 2024 — across all markets — BXP completed 3.3 million square feet of signed leases, Doug Linde, president of BXP, said on the call. Beyond the third quarter, BXP’s pipeline of leases sits at 1.5 million square feet, a 15 percent jump compared to the 1.3 million square feet it had in the works after the second quarter. “If we execute most of the remaining leases during the fourth quarter, we will end the year at over four and a half million square feet of transactions,” Linde said. Additionally, the firm reported its third-quarter 2024 earnings results on Oct. 29 with revenue rising 4.2 percent to $859.2 million for the quarter, compared to $824.3 million for the same period in 2023. Net income was $83.6 million, or 52 cents per diluted share, and it had a net loss of $111.8 million, or 71 cents per diluted share, for the 2023 third quarter. BXP stock was trading in the red on Wednesday afternoon at $82.01 per share, a nearly 5 percent drop from its opening price. Amanda Schiavo can be reached at aschiavo@commercialobserver.com.

Title: Your Mag 7 Earnings Guide
URL: https://dailyreckoning.com/your-mag-7-earnings-guide/
Time Published: 2024-10-29T13:56:43Z
Full Content:
By Greg Guenthner Posted October 29, 2024 Short sellers took a beating last week following Tesla’s post-earnings romp that shot the stock higher by more than 25%. TSLA posted its best trading day in over a decade when management announced it topped Q3 profit estimates and improved automotive gross margins. Just two days later, the shorts banked losses of $4.2 billion closing out bets against the stock during its historic rally, according to data from S3 Partners. Not bad for a company so many investors love to hate… It’s no secret Tesla is a company that evokes strong emotions from just about everybody. Whether we’re talking about Elon Musk’s politics or online trolling, the latest Cybertruck recalls, or dwindling demand throughout the EV space, even casual investors held negative opinions on Tesla following its ugly first-half performance. Tesla shares were driven into the ground despite a roaring bull market for mega-cap tech earlier this year. And even as the stock began to show signs of bottoming out over the summer, most investors continued to expect the worst. I started getting bulled up on TSLA in late June as the beaten-down stock approached a potential breakout at $200. My reasoning was simple: The stock chart was quickly improving, posting a positive reaction to mediocre earnings back in April. Meanwhile, the bearish arguments were getting louder. Well, that $200 breakout lit the fuse for a quick 30% rally in July. And after a hard reset, shares were once again perking up as the fourth quarter began. Following last week’s earnings beat, the stock is now green on the year and threatening to run to $300… and beyond. Why does any of this matter? Because TSLA’s earnings rally was a potential preview of what’s coming when more of the Mag 7 mega-caps report this week. Earnings are unavoidable for anyone with a trading timeframe longer than a couple of months. But momentum and swing traders can mostly avoid earnings surprises if they so choose. That’s usually my style: selling (or partially selling) open swing trades ahead of earnings announcements, and making a point to avoid jumping into a new play directly in front of an earnings release. But I do keep a close watch on earnings, specifically how the Street reacts to the numbers. If TSLA is any indication, we could be in for more than a few powerful post-earnings rallies this week as many of the biggest names report. Here’s what you should expect… Alphabet Inc. (GOOG)Market cap: $2.06 trillion Reports Tuesday (Oct 29) After the Close Estimates:Earnings – $1.84 per shareRevenue – $86.39B Previous Call:Earnings – Consensus: $2.95 per share Actual: $2.94 per share Revenue – Consensus: 64.38B Actual: $68.71B Google (I refuse to call this company Alphabet) missed its annual earnings estimates for the 2022 fiscal year. But revenue remained on track. The company is back in the habit of beating earnings regularly, crushing April’s estimates by 25%. Turning to the chart, we have a lovely setup for a post-earnings rally should the numbers impress investors: GOOG is up more than 90% since the Nov. 2022 bottom, yet it’s approximately 15% off its all-time highs logged on July 10. The stock decisively cleared its 2021 peak in April, breaking into new all-time highs. Price has retested those former highs, found support, and now challenges the upper bounds of a multi-month consolidation. I love springboard plays like this where price retests an area of resistance-turned support. GOOG has already started to bounce – and could quickly run back to those all-time highs near $200 following a positive earnings reaction. Apple Inc. (AAPL) Market cap: $3.56 trillion Reports Wednesday (Oct 30) After the Close Estimates:Earnings – $1.59 per shareRevenue – $94.46B Previous Call:Earnings – Consensus: $1.34 per share Actual: $1.40 per share Revenue – Consensus: $393.09B Actual: $383.29B AAPL is a beast, and arguably the most magnificent of the seven mega-caps. The company has exceeded earning estimates since 2020 – no small feat! And it has crushed its past four earnings reports. Oh, and did I mention the chart is a thing of beauty? Check it out: The stock is up more than 85% off its early 2023 lows. And despite a maximum drop of approximately 30% during its most recent drawdown, the stock continues to power higher off each and every one of those lows. AAPL shares are coiled tightly just below all-time highs. Barring a major negative surprise or a seismic shift in the market, it’s difficult to imagine this stock failing to post new highs in the weeks ahead. Microsoft (MSFT) Market cap: $3.18 trillion Reports Wednesday (Oct 30) After the Close Estimates:Earnings – $3.10 per shareRevenue – $64.57B Previous Call:Earnings – Consensus: $2.94 per share Actual: $2.95 per share Revenue – Consensus: $244.82B Actual: $245.12B Like many companies, Microsoft had a tough time during the 2022 bear market, missing top and bottom line estimates. But it’s back on track and exceeding quarterly projections. Everyone on Wall Street is expecting a strong performance. If MSFT’s performance off its 2022 lows is any indication, we should see a continuation higher: MSFT has more than doubled since Nov. 2022. But the stock has essentially moved sideways for the past eight months. It’s now about 10% off its all-time high set back in July. The big question: Can MSFT escape its choppy, sideways range and continue higher? We’ll see if Wednesday’s earnings can ignite a fresh move higher to begin the journey… Meta (META)Market cap: $1.46 trillion Reports Thursday (Oct. 31) Halloween Night Estimates:Earnings – $5.21 per shareRevenue – $40.19 B Previous Call:Earnings – Consensus: $14.41 per share Actual: $14.87 per share Revenue – Consensus: $133.68B Actual: $134.90B Meta was one of the hardest-hit tech names of the 2022 bear market. The company had just changed its name from Facebook to Meta and was feeling the heat, falling short of earnings estimates as the stock sunk into the abyss. But Meta has miraculously gone from worst to first since bottoming out in late 2022. Now, it’s back on track delivering beats since Q1 of last year. Just look at that comeback rally: Say what you like about Zuck and his metaverse plans – META is up 545% off its 2022 lows. Today it sits just about 5% off its all-time highs posted earlier this month. The stock just completed a 5-month consolidation on its way to new all-time highs, making it the strongest chart of the Mag 7s heading into earnings. A solid beat could keep the party going to $600 and beyond… Amazon (AMZN) Market cap: $1.99 trillionReports Thursday (Oct. 31) Halloween Night Estimates:Earnings – $1.14 per shareRevenue – $157.26 B Previous Call:Earnings – Consensus: $2.70 per share Actual: $2.90 per share Revenue – Consensus: $570.87B Actual: $574.78B Here’s the thing about AMZN: those boxes will keep showing up on your doorstep, no matter what. But the company hasn’t exactly set the world on fire lately. Revenue fell short in 2021 and earnings missed in 2022, yet it steadily beats estimates since the start of 2023. Is there a bigger comeback in the works? Let’s check the chart: If you had to pick a dog to run with TSLA, it has to be AMZN. While we’ve witnessed a strong comeback from its 2022 lows, the stock has yet to post a significant rally above its 2021 peak. If AMZN can impress investors this week, could we finally see a bigger breakout? It’s possible! This is a great chart from a risk/reward standpoint.
