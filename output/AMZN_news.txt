US Stock futures slide as President Donald Trump announces 30% tariffs on the EU and Mexico, set to begin August 1, raising fresh concerns over trade tensions. While markets dipped early, they rebounded slightly as investors hoped the tariffs would be negotiated down. Traders are also focused on this week’s second-quarter earnings reports from big banks like JPMorgan and upcoming inflation data, both of which could impact sentiment. Meanwhile, Trump’s growing rift with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell adds pressure to markets already on edge. Also, Bitcoin hits another record, and Tesla eyes a potential xAI investment vote.
