Nvidia (NVDA+0.84%) stock fell 5.7% on Thursday, bringing its decline this year to more than 17% amid concerns about declines in spending on AI, amid a general selloff in that took the tech-centered Nasdaq 100 down 2.8%. The wider Composite index fell 2.6%. “The decline in Nvidia’s stock price has much less to do with company fundamentals and much more to do with macro considerations, namely uncertainty around tariffs and trade policy,” Will Rhind, CEO and founder of GraniteShares told Quartz in an email. “The company posted very strong Q4 earnings showing they remain at the forefront of the AI technology race.” He suggested that if trade war discussions are mostly noise, this could be an opportunity to buy Nvidia shares at their lowest valuation in a while. Rival chipmakers also fell, with Broadcom (AVGO+8.04%) plummeting 6.3% ahead of earnings, Micron (MU+2.76%) about 5.4%, and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD+0.71%) 2.8%. The U.S.-listed shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM-0.05%) dropped 4.6%. Marvell Technology’s (MRVL-3.44%) shares plunged almost 20% after the semiconductor company’s earnings guidance didn’t impress investors. ON Semiconductor (ON+3.03%) fell 5.6% after Allegro MicroSystems called “inadequate” ON’s unsolicited acquisition offer of $35.10 a share in cash. Meanwhile, Allegro (ALGM-2.31%) gained 5.7%, going against the tide. Outside of chipmakers, other tech giants also fell, with Meta (META-0.92%) down 4.4% and Amazon (AMZN-1.15%) declining 3.7%. The shares of Apple (AAPL+1.22%) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL+0.35%) fell by smaller amounts. MongoDB’s (MDB-2.84%) shares plunged 27% after the database software company issued weaker-than-expected earnings guidance.

Title: Trump tariffs are a risk for Big Tech. But 'don't run for the hills,' analysts say

President Donald Trump’s broad-ranging tariffs went into effect earlier Tuesday, sending the market in a downward spiral. The United States will be enacting 25% duties on all Mexican goods and most Canadian goods, and 20% on all imports from China. Retaliatory tariffs followed promptly: Canada imposed 25% tariff on $107 billion worth of American goods, as China announced duties of up to 15% on agricultural products and targeted actions at more than 20 companies, including artificial intelligence startups and drone makers. Mexico’s President Claudia Sheinbaum said she will announce retaliatory measures on Sunday. The tech industry is wary. Shares of Tesla (TSLA-1.77%), which owns a major assembly plant in China, were down more than 3% in Tuesday late afternoon trading. The stock gained back some of its losses from earlier in the day when several investors downgraded the stock due to tariff fears. Retailer Best Buy (BBY+0.96%) warned investors that the duties could increase the price of the electronics it sells. “In terms of visibility of goods, I’d say Apple (AAPL+1.22%) and Tesla are probably the headliners,” D.A. Davidson head of technology Gil Luria told Quartz. But the tariffs and their immediate impact is by no means unexpected by global markets as Trump made his fondness of tariffs clear even on the campaign trail. Tech analysts are more worried about how long the tariffs will last, as well as whether or not further escalation in reciprocals will occur — and if they’ll extend beyond tariffs on physical goods. “It’s far more likely that this time, they’re going to hurt the U.S. where it matters,” Luria said, adding that the big tech companies are “the best target.” If Canada, Mexico or China decide that the U.S. has taken a confrontational approach to tariffs, they can respond in kind by penalizing big tech companies like Microsoft (MSFT-1.51%), Google (GOOGL+0.35%), Meta (META-0.92%) or Amazon (AMZN-1.15%). This, Luria said, would be “the most meaningful and most broad in its impact.” “In China, for instance, they can just eliminate the sales of iPhone altogether,” Luria said. “These are all things that any country that the U.S. is getting into a confrontation with could decide to do in order to exert pressure on the U.S. to reduce those tariffs.” Following the first set of 10% tariffs on Chinese imports last month, Beijing was quick to retaliate with an investigation into alleged antitrust violations by Google while reportedly laying the groundwork for a formal probe into Apple’s App Store. Last month, the Financial Times reported that the EU is ready to impose retaliatory measures on Big Tech companies in the case of a potential dispute with the Trump administration. Trump has threatened to use tariffs on the EU several times. But some are optimistic that things won’t escalate to that point. “As we navigated in 2018/2019 we caution this is all a game of high stakes poker to get other countries to the negotiating table and will very likely not last for an elongated period of time,” Wedbush’s Dan Ives wrote in Tuesday morning’s note. An aggressive approach towards China and chip export controls is “the biggest risk” to the artificial intelligence trade, according to Ives. Nvidia (NVDA+0.84%) stock closed down 8.7% on Monday after Singaporean police uncovered an illegal export operation aiming to take servers containing Nvidia chips to mainland China in violation of American chip export controls that the market fears the U.S. might now further restrict. “Outside of the U.S., there’s been a surprising amount of openness to working on DeepSeek models, and the more the U.S. alienates its trading partners, the more likely they are to gravitate to Chinese models,” Luria said. But any slowdown in the AI trade associated with these tariff-borne near-term risks will be short-lived, according to Wedbush analysts. “Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Palantir (PLTR+3.80%), Salesforce (CRM-1.72%), Tesla, Apple will remain the stocks to own and any weakness is a buying opportunity in our view given the fundamental demand picture,” Ives wrote. “This will be an ‘uncomfortable time for growth investors’... but ultimately this is not the time to run for the hills in the tech trade and instead own these tech AI winners.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

(Photo by Noushad Thekkayil/NurPhoto via Getty Images). Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock experienced a decline of over 3% on Monday, March 3, amid a broader Wall Street downturn. This sell-off was triggered by President Donald Trump’s tariff confirmation, which resulted in the Dow Jones falling 1.8% and the S&P 500 dropping 2.1%, marking its worst day of the year to date. Our take on market crash risk right now has more details on tariffs and its impact on the broader market. At its current levels of $205, AMZN stock looks attractive but volatile — making it a tricky pick to buy. We believe there is minimal cause for concern with AMZN stock, which makes it attractive but highly sensitive to adverse events as its current valuation is very high. We arrive at our conclusion by comparing the current valuation of AMZN stock with its operating performance over the recent years as well as its current and historical financial condition. Our analysis of Amazon.com along key parameters of Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience shows that the company has a very strong operating performance and financial condition, as detailed below. However, if you seek upside with less volatility than a single stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and achieved returns greater than 91% since inception. Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, AMZN stock looks expensive compared to the broader market. • Amazon.com has a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 4.0 vs. a figure of 3.1 for the S&P 500 • Additionally, the company's price-to-operating income (P/EBIT) ratio is 41.4 compared to 24.4 for S&P 500 • And, it has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 22.3 vs. the benchmark’s 24.4 Amazon.com’s Revenues have seen notable growth over recent years. • Amazon.com has seen its top line grow at an average rate of 14.3% over the last 3 years (vs. 9.8% for S&P 500) • Its revenues have grown 11.9% from $554 billion to $620 billion in the last 12 months (vs. change of 5.6% for S&P 500) • Also, its quarterly revenues grew 11.0% to $159 billion in the most recent quarter from $143 billion a year ago (vs. 7.2% change for S&P 500) Amazon.com’s profit margins are around the median level for companies in the Trefis coverage universe. • Amazon.com’s Operating Income over the last four quarters was $61 billion, which represents a moderate Operating Margin of 9.8% (vs. 12.6% for S&P 500) • Amazon.com’s Operating Cash Flow (OCF) over this period was $113 billion, pointing to a moderate OCF-to-Sales Ratio of 18.2% (vs. 14.4% for S&P 500) Amazon.com's balance sheet looks strong. • Amazon.com’s Debt figure was $135 billion at the end of the most recent quarter, while its market capitalization is $2.2 trillion (as of March 3, 2025). This implies a strong Debt-to-Equity Ratio of 5.4% (vs. 19.7% for S&P 500). [Note: A lower Debt-to-Equity Ratio is desirable] • Cash (including cash equivalents) makes up $101 billion of the $625 billion in Total Assets for Amazon.com. This yields a strong Cash-to-Assets Ratio of 15.1% (vs. 14.1% for S&P 500) AMZN stock has been more resilient than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns.
