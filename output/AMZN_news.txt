However, these choppy markets can harbor plenty of opportunities — for those who know where to look. Investors shouldn't focus too much on short-term volatility as they position their portfolios. Recommendations from Wall Street can help them make informed decisions on stocks and seek solid long-term returns. Top-rated analysts pay attention to multiple aspects when selecting stocks of companies with solid fundamentals and strong execution. Bearing that in mind, here are three stocks favored by the Street's top pros, according to TipRanks, a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance. We start this week with e-commerce and cloud computing giant Amazon (AMZN). The company impressed investors with third-quarter beats on the top and bottom lines, fueled by strength in its cloud and advertising businesses. In reaction to the solid Q3 print, Monness analyst Brian White reaffirmed a buy rating on Amazon stock and boosted the price target to $245 from $225. While the analyst acknowledged regulatory pressures, he remains bullish on AMZN as he thinks it will continue to "capitalize on the cloud, expand its digital ad business, innovate with AI, realize efficiencies from a regional fulfillment network, and leverage a leaner cost structure." White highlighted that Amazon's revenue growth accelerated to 17%, with significant profit upside. Notably, Q3 operating profit exceeded his estimates, driving record operating margin at 11%. He also noted the sharp sequential rise in operating margins at Amazon Web Services, or AWS, and International business. Based on the solid results, the analyst raised his revenue and earnings per share estimates for 2024 and 2025. White also pointed out Amazon's focus on reducing costs via improved efficiencies and new initiatives such as regionalizing its U.S. fulfillment network. The company now aims to regionalize its U.S. inbound network and leverage advanced robotic innovations across its fulfillment network. Overall, White sees lucrative growth potential for Amazon across e-commerce, AWS, digital media, advertising, Alexa, robotics, artificial intelligence and other avenues. White ranks No. 38 among more than 9,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 69% of the time, delivering an average return of 20.4%. See Amazon Stock Charts on TipRanks. We now move to this week's second pick, ride-sharing platform Uber Technologies (UBER). The company recently delivered better-than-expected third-quarter revenue and earnings. However, it missed Wall Street's expectations for Q3 gross bookings. Nonetheless, Evercore analyst Mark Mahaney remains bullish on UBER stock. He reiterated a buy rating with a price target of $120, following a series of investor meetings with management. Mahaney thinks UBER will gain from autonomous vehicle rollouts, given its position as the largest ride-sharing demand aggregator. He added that better availability of robotaxis on the Uber platform will drive improved customer service through shorter wait times, broader ride selection and possibly lower prices. "UBER believes that the economics it can offer AV owners can be compelling, allowing them to generate very high margins and better fleet utilization than they can develop on their own," said Mahaney. Based on his discussions with management, Mahaney explained that the deceleration reflecting in Uber's Mobility bookings growth in Q3 and the estimate for Q4 is due to the negative demand elasticity caused by the surge in insurance costs and a slowdown in "party hour" bookings, or those that take place during evenings and weekends. He thinks this deceleration will moderate, given the slowdown in the rate of insurance cost increases, growth prospects of new products such as Uber for Teens and Uber for Business as well as potential improvement in consumer discretionary demand. Finally, Mahaney remains confident about Uber's ability to consistently boost its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and free cash flow margins over the next three to five years, supported by multiple measures to drive cost efficiencies. Mahaney ranks No. 34 among more than 9,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been successful 64% of the time, delivering an average return of 28.9%. See Uber Technologies Stock Options on TipRanks. Finally, let's look at fintech giant Block (SQ). The company, formerly known as Square, narrowly beat analysts' earnings expectations but missed revenue estimates for the third quarter. Following the results, BTIG analyst Andrew Harte discussed the positives and negatives of Block's Q3 performance. He noted that the company's initial FY25 gross profit growth guidance of at least 15% almost met the consensus estimate at 14.9%. However, Q4 gross profit outlook of 14% fell short of expectations due to the shift in the timing of certain expected benefits from Q4 to next year. The analyst thinks CEO Jack Dorsey did a good job in highlighting the company's lending products and explaining how they are fueling the growth of Block's ecosystem. Despite the soft Q4 guidance and management's commentary indicating that investors will have to wait until the second half of 2025 for growth acceleration, SQ stock continues to be a top pick for BTIG. Harte cited several reasons for his bullish stance, including Block's track record of surpassing guidance and the stock's attractive valuation at 12-times FY25 EV (enterprise value)/EBITDA. He added that the company is in the early days of fueling increased product adoption in both its Cash and Square ecosystems, indicating continued growth potential ahead. "Block is just beginning to integrate its Cash App and Square ecosystems, which could create meaningful flywheel effects over time," said Harte while reiterating a buy rating on the stock with a price target of $90. Harte ranks No. 152 among more than 9,100 analysts tracked by TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 75% of the time, delivering an average return of 63.8%.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. New investors just starting out have many choices available to them, and deciding where to begin can be a challenge. Rather than choosing one stock or sector to invest in, investors can instead gain broad exposure to hundreds of the U.S. market’s best stocks through a broad-market S&P 500 ETF like the SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 ETF (SPLG). Discover the latest stocks recommended by top Wall Street analysts, all in one place with Analyst Top Stocks Make smarter investments with weekly expert stock picks from the Smart Investor Newsletter I’m bullish on SPLG due to its strong history of returns and its easy access to the earnings power of over 500 of the U.S.’s best companies in one simple and efficient vehicle. Not only that, it does so for a very low fee, as we’ll discuss in the article. These factors make SPLG a sound choice for all investors. In particular, its instant diversification, extremely low cost, and impressive track record make it an especially appealing choice for new investors looking to make their first investment and to choose an investment to build their portfolios around. According to its issuer, State Street Global Advisors, SPLG is a “low-cost ETF that seeks to offer precise, comprehensive exposure to the US large-cap market segment.” State Street also explains that SPLG is “one of the low-cost core SPDR Portfolio ETFs, a suite of portfolio building blocks designed to provide broad, diversified exposure to core asset classes.” This strategy plays out when you look at SPLG’s holdings. The fund simply invests in the S&P 500 (SPX), which “represents approximately 80% of the US market.” This is a big part of what makes SPLG an ideal building block for investors who are just starting out—rather than picking one company or sector, you are immediately getting broad exposure to the companies that account for about 80% of the U.S. market. This includes many of the best, most profitable, and most innovative companies in the United States (and the world). In fact, SPLG gives investors exposure to semiconductors and artificial intelligence (AI) through Nvidia (NVDA), e-commerce and the cloud through Amazon (AMZN), electric vehicles and renewable power through Tesla (TSLA), and so much more. Below, you’ll find an overview of SPLG’s top 10 holdings using TipRanks’ holdings tool. It’s worth noting that these are also some highly rated companies, according to TipRanks’ Smart Score. The Smart Score is TipRanks’ quantitative stock scoring system that gives stocks a score from one to 10, based on eight key market factors. Scores of eight, nine, or 10 are considered equivalent to an Outperform rating. Many of SPLG’s top 10 holdings are rated highly by this system: Amazon and Meta Platforms (META) receive perfect 10 ratings, while Nvidia, Tesla, Alphabet (GOOGL), and Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) all receive Outperform-equivalent ratings of 8 or higher. Owning these top U.S. stocks has proven to be a winning strategy that has generated strong long-term results for SPLG and its holders. One can’t necessarily say that SPLG has beaten the market because SPLG is the market. Nevertheless, the long-term results have been strong. As of October 31, SPLG has generated an annualized return of 9.1%. Over the past five years, SPLG has posted an annualized return of 15.3%, and over the past 10 years, SPLG has posted an annualized return of 12.9%. Looking at it from a different perspective, an investor who put $10,000 into SPLG five years ago would have $20,990 today, doubling their initial investment in five years. Moreover, an investor putting $10,000 into SPLG a decade ago would have an investment worth $34,490 today, more than tripling their money. While past performance is no guarantee of future results, this is a strong track record and a compelling proposition for new investors just starting out, and therefore makes SPLG an ideal cornerstone for the portfolios of new investors. So what does SPLG charge for this strong performance and broad exposure to over 500 of the top stocks in the U.S.? With an expense ratio of just 0.02%, SPLG is one of the cheapest ETFs you’ll find in today’s market. This 0.02% expense ratio means that an investor in the fund will pay just a negligible $2 in fees for every $10,000 invested on an annual basis. Assuming that the fund returns 5% annually going forward and maintains this expense ratio, this same investor will pay just a minuscule $26 in fees over the course of a decade. It’s hard to beat that kind of savings. Perhaps the best way to put SPLG’s 0.02% expense ratio into perspective is to point out that it is significantly cheaper than many of the other popular broad-market ETFs available to investors. For instance, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO), one of the largest ETFs from the low-cost fund giant Vanguard, charges a low 0.03%, but it’s still 50% more expensive than SPLG. Similarly, the iShares Core S&P Total U.S. Stock Market ETF also charges 0.03%. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY), the largest ETF (and from the same issuer as SPLG), charges 0.09%, which is four and a half times higher than SPLG. Are there any risks to investing in SPLG? Of course, there are, as no investment comes without risk. The immediate risk that comes to mind is that the S&P 500’s valuation is fairly elevated compared to where it has typically traded historically. Right now, the index trades at a price-to-earnings multiple of 25.4 times earnings, above its five-year average of 19.6 times earnings and its 10-year average of 18.1 times earnings (according to data from Factset). While the valuation is relatively high, these are some of America’s strongest companies, and it’s difficult to bet against their earnings growth in the coming years, with the valuation likely adjusting over time. For example, with S&P 500 companies expected to grow earnings next year, the forward price-to-earnings multiple of 22.2 is still slightly above historical levels but appears more reasonable. Plus, new investors can start a position today and build it over time using dollar-cost averaging, where they invest a fixed amount at regular intervals. Alternatively, they can begin with a portion of their capital and add more during periods of market weakness to secure better entry points at a lower valuation. Turning to Wall Street, SPLG earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 401 Buys, 96 Holds, and one Sell rating assigned in the past three months. The average SPLG stock price target of $76.61 implies 9.1% upside potential from current levels. In conclusion, I’m bullish on SPLG based on its strong track record of providing great returns to investors for a low fee over the long term. It gives investors broad exposure to over 500 of the top stocks in the U.S. market for an ultra-low expense ratio of just 0.02%, making it a sound cornerstone for new investors to build their portfolios around.
