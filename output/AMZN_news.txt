Title: What’s Driving Amazon Stock To New Highs?

ByTrefis Team, Contributor. In early 2023, Amazon's stock (NASDAQ: AMZN) was trading at a modest $84. Today, it has soared to $232, a stunning 176% jump that significantly outpaces the broader NASDAQ index's 2x rise. So, what's fueling this incredible surge? The answer lies in three critical factors: But the question remains: Can this powerhouse performance continue? We’ll dive into what’s driving this momentum and what the future holds for Amazon. But if you seek an upside with less volatility than holding an individual stock, consider the High Quality Portfolio. It has comfortably outperformed its benchmark—a combination of the S&P 500, Russell, and S&P MidCap indexes—and has achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Separately, see – CoreWeave Stock To $200? Beyond its sheer size, Amazon's revenue growth is driven by a hidden engine: a powerful shift in its business model. While its e-commerce sales are impressive, they are no longer the primary force. The real story lies in the company's strategic diversification, with three key areas serving as the main catalysts for its recent surge. The undisputed heavyweight champion of Amazon's growth is Amazon Web Services (AWS). This cloud computing arm has proven to be an exceptionally valuable asset, far outpacing the growth of Amazon's traditional retail operations. While North American and international sales grew by 23% and 21% respectively between 2022 and 2024, AWS revenue surged by a solid 34% over the same period. Its high-margin, scalable services for businesses, governments, and individuals make it the company's most important growth engine. Another crucial, and often overlooked, driver of Amazon's financial success is its rapidly expanding digital advertising business. Much like Google and Meta, Amazon has leveraged its vast customer data and massive platform to become a dominant player in the ad world. This segment, which includes sponsored product listings and display ads, has been growing at a remarkable pace, providing a high-profit-margin revenue stream that diversifies the company's earnings beyond e-commerce and cloud services. Amazon's third major growth driver is its subscription services, most notably its Prime membership, which has evolved into a comprehensive ecosystem of benefits beyond free shipping to include streaming video and music, exclusive deals, and more. This has created a loyal and engaged customer base that not only pays a recurring fee but also spends more on Amazon's platform than non-Prime members. This steady, predictable revenue stream provides a solid financial foundation and strengthens the company's competitive moat. Looking ahead, these drivers face a new challenge: the intense competition in the AI arms race. AWS's leadership in cloud computing is being challenged by rivals like Microsoft (Azure) and Google (Cloud), who are making massive investments in generative AI. Microsoft's partnership with OpenAI and Google's rapid expansion of AI services pose a significant threat. To maintain its market leadership, Amazon is also pouring tens of billions into AI-related capital expenditures, a strategic move that will shape its future and determine if its extraordinary growth can continue. Amazon's stunning rise in valuation can be attributed to its dramatic financial transformation, where a once-unprofitable e-commerce giant has become a profit-making powerhouse. This shift has reshaped investor sentiment and sent its valuation soaring. The most significant catalyst behind this change is AWS. This high-margin cloud business has single-handedly revolutionized Amazon's profitability. Since 2022, Amazon's operating margin has skyrocketed by an astounding 377%, climbing from a meager 2.4% to a robust 11.4%. This incredible expansion in profitability, fueled by AWS, is the key reason investors are now willing to pay a premium for Amazon's stock. It signals a new era of sustainable, high-quality earnings. This surge in profitability, combined with strong revenue growth and the strategic expansion of AWS, has directly impacted Amazon’s valuation. Investors now value the company as a technology and cloud leader. As a result, the company's price-to-sales valuation multiple has ballooned by 124%, jumping from 1.7x trailing revenues in 2022 to an impressive 3.7x today. This multiple expansion is a direct reflection of the market's newfound confidence in Amazon's long-term profit potential. At its current price of around $230, Amazon's stock is trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 3.7x, which aligns closely with its five-year average of 3.2x. However, there are compelling reasons to believe the valuation multiple could expand further. See, AI is not just a buzzword for Amazon; it's a strategic weapon poised to supercharge its growth and reshape its financial future. The company's massive investments in artificial intelligence are set to ignite a new wave of expansion across its entire business empire. Within AWS, AI is the new frontier. As businesses race to develop and deploy their own AI applications, they are driving unprecedented demand for AWS's cloud infrastructure. This isn't just about incremental growth; it's a direct catalyst for skyrocketing cloud sales, solidifying AWS's position as a profit powerhouse. In fact, if you want a detailed breakdown of how this growth can help Amazon's stock, take a look at our analysis – Amazon Stock: Path to 2x Growth – which highlights the key factors. But the AI revolution isn't limited to the cloud. On the retail side, AI is being woven into the very fabric of the shopping experience. Think smarter product recommendations, lightning-fast search, and deeply personalized storefronts. These aren't just minor upgrades—they're powerful tools designed to boost sales, increase the value of every order, and make advertising on the platform more effective than ever. This enhanced ad targeting will also extend its influence across the wider digital advertising landscape, creating a lucrative new revenue stream. All of this adds up to a compelling financial outlook. Amazon projects low double-digit sales growth over the next three years, with its bottom-line profits expected to grow even faster. This blend of accelerating profitability, continued AWS dominance, and an ironclad grip on the e-commerce market, presents a powerful case for a higher valuation. Investors are already taking notice, recognizing that Amazon's strategic AI initiatives are not just a plan—they're the blueprint for a new era of growth and value creation. Despite its powerful rise, Amazon’s stock is not without its vulnerabilities. Its history is marked by sharp drops that have far outpaced the broader market, highlighting both its inherent volatility and remarkable resilience. During the 2022 inflation-driven market sell-off, Amazon stock plunged a staggering 52%, a far steeper decline than the S&P 500's 25% drop. The stock's recovery took over a year, not regaining its previous high until February 2024. More recently, during periods of heightened trade war concerns, the pattern repeated—Amazon plummeted 30% while the S&P 500's peak-to-trough decline was a more modest 19%. This history shows that when markets turn, Amazon can fall harder and faster than its peers. Beyond market-wide shocks, the company faces significant company-specific risks. A primary concern is its massive capital expenditure. Since 2022, Amazon has invested a colossal $257 billion in CapEx. This is a high-stakes gamble, and a critical question looms: What if these massive investments don't yield the returns investors expect? Simultaneously, the explosive growth of its core profit driver, AWS, could be threatened by intense competition from rivals like Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. A slowdown in AWS growth, combined with concerns over the payback on its huge investments, could create a challenging scenario. For a deeper dive into these risks, including the factors that could cause a severe downturn, we've captured a full downside scenario in our separate analysis: How Amazon Stock Falls By 50%? See, there always remains a meaningful risk when investing in a single, or just a handful, of stocks. Consider the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, which, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

Title: Wall Street Largely Cheers Nvidia's Outlook Even as China Remains an Overhang

Nvidia’s (NVDA) results and outlook elicited a mixed response from Wall Street analysts on Thursday, with some cheering the chip giant's revenue forecast and others lamenting uncertainty around sales to China. The poster child for the AI boom on Wednesday projected third-quarter revenue of $54 billion, plus or minus 2%. The forecast exceeded Wall Street's official estimate of $53.8 billion, but by a narrower margin than many investors have come to expect. Nvidia issued its guidance as it posted better-than-estimated second-quarter results, although key data center revenue lagged forecasts. Nvidia shares are down around 2% in early trading on Thursday, but have retraced larger after-hours declines following the results. Morgan Stanley raised its price target on the stock to $210 from $206 and kept its overweight call, saying Nvidia shares are "less expensive than other AI beneficiaries." They said the "bar [set by Nvidia] continues to be high but the growth acceleration is clear." “For the stock to sell off slightly after hours on these types of numbers certainly indicates that sentiment has largely caught up to the growth potential, after fears of digestion just a few weeks ago,” they wrote. “But outside of China geopolitics, this is a very clean beat and raise quarter." Nvidia CFO Collette Kress said during the earnings call Wednesday that the company hasn't restarted sales of its H20 chips in China yet while the company waits for the U.S. government to formalize its revenue-sharing agreement. Earlier this year, the Trump administration blocked Nvidia’s sale of its H20 chips, which the company tailored for the Chinese market, then this month struck a deal where Nvidia would give the government 15% of China chip revenues in exchange for resumed sales. UBS analysts said they were optimistic on the prospects the rally in the AI-driven bull market would continue after Nvidia's results. “The overall strength of the July quarter results may offer some reassurance for investors after signs of stalling momentum for the large-cap tech rally,” UBS analysts wrote, adding that “the outlook for large-cap tech remains compelling.” Several of Nvidia’s major Big Tech clients, including Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), and Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL), have committed to spending big on their AI capacity, and Nvidia said Wednesday that one customer spent more than $10 billion last quarter. Kress said late Wednesday that the chipmaker anticipates $3 trillion–4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by the end of the decade. HSBC was less upbeat, however, saying Nvidia hasn't delivered a "beat and raise" quarter since its second-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings last year. "We maintain our Hold rating as we expect the near-term supply inconsistency and China uncertainty to remain an overhang," they wrote. Even Morgan Stanley analysts noted that prospects for a resumption of China sales are unclear, and that uncertainties remain around the 15% revenue deal with the government and the need for Beijing to give the green light to resume chip sales. China accounted for 20% of Nvidia’s data center revenue at one point and “while it remains a large market, we simply don’t know how large it will be when it comes back, or if it comes back at all," the analysts wrote.

Title: S&P 500's Weight In Mag 7 Stocks Passes 30%. Is This A Diversification Risk?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/sp-500-weight-mag-7-stocks-diversification-risk/

ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. There are 500 companies in the S&P 500, but only a small percentage have the power to move the index on their own. Among those elite companies are the Magnificent 7—seven stocks that helped drive the S&P 500 to 20%-plus gains in 2023 and 2024. Thanks to their collective success, the Magnificent 7 stocks comprise over one-third of the S&P 500—prompting many investors to wonder if it’s time to worry about concentration risk. Let’s answer that question by reviewing the key factors, potential diversification strategies and expert commentary about the historically high Mag 7 concentration. The Magnificent 7 Stocks are: These seven stocks comprised about 36% of the S&P 500 large-cap index. The remaining 64% of the index was spread across 493 other companies. The Mag 7 concentration first stretched above 30% in 2023. Only eight years prior, these stocks accounted for 12.4% of the S&P 500. By 2022, the concentration had risen to 21.6%. In those years, the collective market capitalization of the Mag 7 companies rose from $2.2 trillion to $6.9 trillion. Today, their total market cap exceeds $19 trillion. The growth has been driven by technology innovation and leadership. Nvidia's success in AI has been particularly influential. It encouraged other tech leaders to sharpen their AI focus and positioned AI as a major wealth opportunity for investors. The S&P 500 weights its constituents using a free-float market capitalization method, which assigns higher weights to larger companies. As a result, larger companies have greater influence over the index than smaller companies. Free-float market cap is the market value of a public company, calculated as the share price times the number of available shares. A stock’s free-float market capitalization relative to the aggregate market cap of the index determines its weight. The total market cap of the S&P 500 is about $54.3 trillion. The largest index member is Nvidia, which has a market cap of $4.4 trillion. To calculate Nvidia's weight in the index, divide $4.4 trillion by $54.3 trillion—which equates to about 8%. Stock price changes affect a company's market capitalization, which in turn influences the index. A company’s weighting in an index can increase when its stock performs better than others, assuming there's no corresponding change in share count. A change to one company's weighting changes all the weightings, since the weighting total is always 100%. Equal-weighted indexes give each constituent the same influence over the group. For example, an equal-weighted S&P 500 fund weights each company at 0.2%. In practice, this means a price increase from Nvidia is as influential as a price increase from Enphase Energy (ENPH), the smallest company in the S&P 500. Note that the S&P 500 contains 503 stocks representing 500 companies. The three additional stocks relate to companies with multiple share classes, such as Alphabet's (GOOG) and (GOOGL). Invesco's S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP) splits Alphabet's total weighting across its two share classes. Since 2023, Mag 7 concentration has contributed to a cumulative S&P 500 gain of 68.4%. In the same timeframe, Invesco’s RSP ETF gained 34.2%. That means market-cap weighting of the Mag 7 concentration has roughly doubled the gains for S&P 500 investors over the last two years. Some of the Mag 7 have continued to be among the best stocks of 2025. As long as the group outperforms, the high concentration enhances S&P 500 returns. Securities that can rise quickly can also fall quickly. There is a chance investors will become disillusioned with AI and technology stocks. Some analysts suggest this is already happening. Last week, Nvidia, Microsoft and other tech stocks dipped after an MIT report suggested that AI investments are not producing measurable returns. These quick pullbacks happen because investors have high growth expectations for these tech leaders. Any sign of a more modest growth trajectory can prompt investors to sell. So, just as Mag 7 outperformance can lift the S&P 500, underperformance of this group can drag the entire S&P 500 down. You can reduce your Mag 7 concentration risk by eliminating redundant funds, reallocating capital to an equal-weight fund or adding exposures to asset types that don't overlap with the S&P 500. The first step to managing Mag 7 concentration risk is understanding how much exposure you have. Review your holdings and note any funds with overlapping portfolios. If you have an S&P 500 fund, market-cap weighted funds targeting any of the following groups will have overlapping Mag 7 exposure: More specifically, if you're worried about Mag 7 concentration risk, you shouldn’t have your entire net worth split between, say, SPY and QQQ. Pick one or reduce your exposure to both. You can also shift some of your existing S&P 500 exposure to an equal-weighted fund. The amount you move depends on your outlook for the Mag 7. If you believe the technology run is largely played out, you could drop the market-cap-weighted exposure entirely. Or, you could take a more modest approach and move 25% of your market-cap-weighted S&P 500 funds into an equal-weighted fund. This would dilute your concentration slightly but still provide upside if Nvidia and friends continue creating value. The S&P 500 is a large-cap index. It has no exposure to small caps, mid caps or international stocks. You could therefore dilute your Mag 7 exposure by investing in these categories via individual stocks or funds. If you are investing in a taxable account with unrealized gains, this reallocation will have tax consequences. You could delay the tax liability by changing the composition of your future trades instead of selling to rebalance. This would shift your exposure gradually. Or, if you're worried about an imminent dip in Mag 7 stocks, sell off a chunk of your S&P 500 exposure and use the proceeds to pay taxes and add the new holdings. In interviews, two experts characterized the Mag 7 concentration risk as worthy of caution, but not panic. Ayako Yoshioka, portfolio consulting director at Wealth Enhancement, notes that most of the Mag 7 companies have strong business models and healthy balance sheets. And while their valuations are high, they are “not overly outlandish,” in Yoshioka’s view. She says concentration risk is a concern, “but timing when it will become a material consequence to overall index returns is difficult to predict.” Dion Hinchcliffe, vice president and CIO practice lead at Futurum Group, believes Mag 7 dominance will continue to enhance returns in the short term. But longer term, the dynamic will change. Signs to watch for include slowing AI monetization and rising investor interest in lagging sectors. Hinchcliffe says, “The danger isn’t just the Mag 7 falling, it’s that the rest of the index is simply too weak to pick up the slack when they do.” Bottom Line The high concentration of the Mag 7 in the S&P 500 increases the index’s potential volatility, but also enhances returns. While there aren’t definitive signs the Mag 7 stocks are losing momentum, they won’t remain dominant forever. Diversification into other asset types can prep your portfolio for that shift. Who Are the Mag 7 Stocks in the S&P 500? The Mag 7 stocks in the S&P 500 are Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META) and Tesla (TSLA). Is It A Concern If 30% Of The Index Is In 7 Stocks? A 30% concentration of seven stocks in one index is a concern if all seven stocks share similar behaviors. The Mag 7 stocks are technology-focused growth companies that have, at times, risen and fallen together. That behavior can encourage excess volatility in the S&P 500. How Can I Diversify Away from Mag 7 Risk? You can diversify away from Mag 7 risk by adding small-cap, mid-cap and international stock exposure to your portfolio. You could also opt for an equal-weight S&P 500 fund instead of a traditional market-cap-weighted S&P 500 fund. Has This Level of Concentration Happened Before? The concentration of the top 10 stocks in the S&P 500 has historically remained below 30%, averaging 24% according to Visual Capitalist. Before 2023, the last high point in the concentration of the top 10 S&P 500 stocks was 28% in 1970.

Artificial intelligence bellwether Nvidia (NVDA) is slated to report quarterly results after markets close later today, with traders prepared for a big stock move. Nvidia's stock is expected to move approximately 6.2% in either direction by the end of the week, according to options pricing data. That big of a move from Tuesday's close would put shares at either $192.88, an all-time high that translates to a $4.7 trillion market capitalization, or $170.66, its lowest price since mid-July. Nvidia has reported earnings 10 times since the release of ChatGPT in late 2022 sparked the AI craze that’s made it the world’s most valuable company. The stock posted double-digit gains in the days after four of those reports, most recently in May 2024. But Nvidia’s earnings have struggled recently to clear the exceptionally high bar set by Wall Street. In the past four quarters, Nvidia stock has moved an average of 3.2% between reporting earnings and the end of the week. On only one of those occasions—the most recent report in May—did Nvidia finish the week above where it was before reporting earnings. Investors will be scrutinizing Nvidia’s report Wednesday for confirmation that AI demand remains strong. Hyperscalers Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG), and Amazon (AMZN) all recently stood by plans to spend hundreds of billions of dollars this year on data center infrastructure and other capital goods, citing robust demand for AI and cloud computing. Nvidia, with an estimated 80% to 90% share of the AI chip market, should be the biggest beneficiary of that spending. Wall Street will also be hoping for updates on sales to China. Nvidia warned in May that the Trump administration’s decision to tighten China export controls could cost it up to $8 billion in the second quarter. Earlier this month, Nvidia and competitor Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) struck a deal with the Trump administration that allows them to resume sales of key AI chips to China in exchange for a 15% cut. That deal came too late to have any impact on Wednesday’s results, but it should be factored into Nvidia’s guidance. Analysts are overwhelmingly bullish on Nvidia. Of the 14 analysts tracked by Visible Alpha with current ratings on Nvidia’s stock, 13 rate it a “buy” and one gives it a neutral “hold” rating. Their targets range from $155 to $225, with the majority above $200. The stock was little changed near $182 in early trading Wednesday ahead of the results. UPDATE—Aug. 27, 2025: This story has been updated with the latest options and share prices.

Title: Which Mag Seven Stocks Should You Own?

ByBill Sarubbi, Contributor. The market is likely to close the year at new highs. Here is the reasoning: Edgar Laurence Smith described the decennial pattern in the 1930s. He found that specific years in each decade had brought regular stock market patterns. For example, years ending in zero had the worst returns while years ending in five have had the best. Years ending in seven have tended to bring crises. The histogram of expected return below details the strength of fifth years based upon the Dow Jones average from 1885. As we can see, the remainder of 2025 has a bullish bias. 1-Dow Jones Monthly Histogram in Years Ending In Five September has historically been the weakest month of the year. However, the ‘five’ influence tends to keep the bear away in the autumn. Here are the bullish percentages (the likelihood that the market will rise) for autumn months for the DJIA since 1885: As we can see, this viewpoint projects higher prices in September-October. Which of the Magnificent Seven stocks should be held? In order to answer this question, relative strength, seasonal and dynamic cycles are analyzed. The unique and proprietary Cycles Research Relative Strength Value screen measures all stocks on the same basis. The seven stocks are ranked below versus the NASDAQ Composite. When reading the table, keep in mind that the NASDAQ value is 97.5. So, Tesla and Apple are lagging the benchmark. NVIDIA= 109.5 Meta= 104.6 Alphabet= 103.4 Microsoft= 99.7 Amazon= 98.7 Tesla= 96.1 Apple=94.0 Analysis is concentrated on top-ranked NVIDIA. The monthly cycle has been accurate in 2025. There is a cycle peak now leading to a low in September. In fact, September has been the fourth-weakest month in any year, so both the dynamic and the seasonal cycles point to lower prices. Add to positions in late September. 2-NVDA Monthly Cycle META’s relative strength began to rise in April, making it one of the stronger stocks in this group. Price and relative strength are at new highs. The coming months have not been strong, but this is based upon only 14 years of data. Besides, the monthly cycle below rises into December. Hold the shares. 3-META Monthly Cycle Alphabet is a mixed picture. Relative strength bottomed in May but has been inconsistent since 2024. The monthly cycle is at a peak now, suggesting that the next buy point is in October. Seasonality has not been very bullish in the second half of the year. The stock is unlikely to outperform the current leaders in the Mag 7. 4-Alphabet Monthly Cycle Microsoft’s relative uptrend began in February, earlier than the other Mag 7 stocks. This stock is one of the few that features an upturn in monthly momentum. The monthly cycle tops in September and falls into yearend. The sell cycles in this stock have been less accurate than the buy signals over the last year. The conclusion is that the share price will rise into yearend but may begin to underperform the other Mag 7 members. 5-Microsoft Monthly Cycle Amazon is seasonally strong in the second half of any year, and the monthly cycle is rising. This is the best cycle combination. In fact, September and November have been two of the most bullish months over the last 28 years. This stock is likely to rise in performance into yearend. Add to positions. 6-Amazon Monthly Cycle The relative strength of Tesla actually topped in May. From now into yearend, only November has shown exceptional strength. The dynamic monthly cycle declines into September, rises into early November and then declines again. It is doubtful that this stock will rise in strength versus its Mag 7 brethren. 7-Tesla Monthly Cycle Apple has been falling in relative terms through 2025.
