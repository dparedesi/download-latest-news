Title: These Stocks Soared in the First Half of 2025. Can They Keep It Up?

The stock market shook off one of its worst sell-offs in recent memory to finish the first half of 2025 on a high note. That's lifted stocks associated with AI, crypto—and gold. How did we get here? It's been a ride. Stocks plummeted in early April after President Donald Trump unveiled sweeping global tariffs that threatened to scramble global supply chains, spike prices, and slow growth. Trump's subsequent pause of those tariffs, however, ignited a rally that was further fueled by benign economic data and easing trade tensions. By the end of June, stocks had rebounded to record highs. Wall Street's latest rally has looked a bit like last year's bull market. Artificial intelligence continued to connect many of the market's winners. But a few new themes have emerged amid the Trump administration's shake-up of the status quo. Here, we'll examine the stock market's leaders from the first six months of 2025—and examine how the forces underlying their gains could evolve in the next six. Crypto investors have been handsomely rewarded for the industry’s spending on November’s election. The industry last year spent more than $100 million in support of pro-crypto candidates. In January, the “most pro-crypto Congress” in history was sworn in and Washington wasted little time giving the industry what it wanted. Federal regulators have dropped pending litigation against cryptocurrency companies. Trump signed an executive order establishing a Bitcoin reserve. In May, the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, which would establish a framework for the regulation of cryptocurrencies, was introduced in the House of Representatives. And the Senate in June passed the GENIUS Act, legislation that establishes rules governing stablecoins. That's helped grow the cryptocurrency market's value to more than $3.2 trillion. Washington’s embrace, however, has also boosted related stocks this year. Robinhood (HOOD) stock more than doubled in price in the first half, while Coinbase (COIN) shares rose 41%. Circle Internet Group’s (CRCL) shares more than doubled during the stablecoin issuer’s first day of trading in early June; the stock rose nearly 750% in the two weeks after its debut. The cryptocurrency legislation working its way through Congress is expected to have little trouble making its way to Trump’s desk for signature in the second half of this year. Trump and his family may continue feeding the industry’s animal spirits with new crypto ventures. Analysts came into the year expecting the group of stocks considered emblematic of the AI trade to change. That has panned out to an extent. Leadership was expected to shift from AI infrastructure stocks—companies like Nvidia (NVDA), whose chips fill the data centers that cloud computing giants like Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) use to train and run AI models—to software and services providers developing and monetizing AI applications. Palantir (PLTR) was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 in the first half of the year; its impressive sales and earnings growth have been driven primarily by its AI software. Social media giant Meta Platforms (META) is the Magnificent Seven’s best performer year-to-date thanks in part to its success introducing AI features that have improved performance metrics. Software stocks are expected to continue to outperform as they improve AI models and develop new applications. They could also benefit from their relative insulation from trade uncertainty, which dented the overall stock market’s returns in the first half. AI infrastructure, a theme that outperformed for most of 2024, continued to be a winner on Wall Street in the first half of this year. Tech giants Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (GOOG), and Meta looked through economic uncertainty and stood by plans to cumulatively spend hundreds of billions of dollars on property, buildings, and equipment this year. Much of that spending is earmarked for the technology required to develop and run advanced AI, like Nvidia chips, Super Micro Computer (SMCI) servers, and Amphenol (APH) fiber optic cables. Those hardware suppliers saw their shares rise 18%, 61%, and 42%, respectively, in the first half. The buildout of power-hungry data centers boosted the stocks of nuclear power providers, whose electricity is in demand from tech companies who say they are looking to shrink their carbon footprints. Shares of Constellation Energy (CEG) and Vistra (VST) advanced 44% and 41%, respectively. But bringing new nuclear power online is a long process, and data centers are in the meantime relying on natural gas, boosting the stocks of gas-fired plant operators like NRG Energy (NRG), up 78% year-to-date, and gas turbine makers like GE Vernova (GEV), up 61%. Experts expect the AI infrastructure trade to be resilient. Tech giants “are planning for long-term data center capacity requirements and won’t alter their investment plans based on tariff regimes that change from week to week,” said Shaon Baqui, tech equities analyst at Janus Henderson Investors. The mood globally in the first half of 2025 was tense, to put it mildly. That was good for gold. In five months, the second Trump administration launched a global trade war targeting friends and foes alike; opened questions about America's commitment to longtime alliances like NATO; increased America’s involvement in Israel’s conflict with its neighbors; and ratcheted up tensions with China. Investors who sought stability turned to gold, a time-honored safe-haven asset. Gold prices climbed to record high after record high, peaking at more than $3,450 on June 13, the day Israel launched attacks on Iran’s nuclear program. Shares of gold miner Newmont (NEM) followed prices higher, rising 56% over the first half of the year. Fellow miners Barrick (B) and Agnico Eagle Mines (AEM) advanced 34% and 52%, respectively. Central banks, wary of inflation and their reliance on U.S.-controlled reserve assets, have been major buyers of gold in recent years. Demand for gold is expected to remain high for the foreseeable future as governments around the world seek to hedge against elevated geopolitical tensions and an uncertain global economic outlook. The World Gold Council’s most recent Central Bank Gold Reserves survey found that nearly all central banks expect global gold reserves to increase over the next 12 months. A record 43% of respondents said they plan to add to their gold holdings over the same period.

U.S. stock futures are pointing slightly lower as investors monitor trade talks and Senate budget negotiations; Tesla (TSLA) shares are falling in premarket trading as the feud between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump escalates again; Apple (AAPL) reportedly could turn to OpenAI or Anthropic for help enhancing its Siri voice-activated service; Oracle (ORCL) shares are hovering near the all-time high set Monday after the software provider reported lucrative new cloud deals; and Amazon's (AMZN) robotic workforce reportedly nears the size of its human staff in its warehouses. Here's what investors need to know today. U.S. stock futures are pointing slightly lower in premarket trading as investors monitor trade talks and Senate deliberations of budget legislation. S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures are down 0.2% after both indexes posted fresh all-time closing highs yesterday. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are ticking lower. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) and the 10-year Treasury yield are lower. Oil and gold futures are higher. Tesla shares are more than 5% lower in premarket trading as the feud between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump heats up again. "Elon may get more subsidy than any human being in history, by far, and without subsidies, Elon would probably have to close up shop and head back home to South Africa," Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform, hours after Musk again criticized the "One Big Beautiful Bill" being debated in the Senate, which includes a provision that would eliminate the $7,500 new EV tax credit. During the initial escalation of the public spat between Musk and Trump on June 5, shares tumbled 14%, erasing more than $150 billion from Tesla's market capitalization. Apple (AAPL) could turn to ChatGPT maker OpenAI or Anthropic after delays in the launch of its highly anticipated AI-enhanced Siri, according to a Bloomberg report. The iPhone maker has been in talks with both companies about using AI models instead of in-house technology, the report said, after significant delays have raised pressure on Apple to prove it can compete with other tech leaders on AI development. Shares of Apple are 0.6% higher in premarket trading after closing 2% higher yesterday following the report. Oracle (ORCL) shares are edging higher in premarket trading after closing at an all-time high of $218.63 Monday as CEO Safra Catz touted what she called a "strong start" to fiscal 2026, with several lucrative cloud deals, "including one that is expected to contribute more than $30 billion in annual revenue starting in FY28." Analysts at Stifel reportedly raised their price target for Oracle stock to $250 per share from $180, pointing to Oracle's strong cloud growth. Amazon (AMZN) soon will have as many robots working in its warehouses as it does humans, according to a report in The Wall Street Journal. Roughly 75% of the e-commerce giant's global deliveries "are assisted in some way by robotics," the Journal said, adding that "the average number of employees Amazon had per facility last year, roughly 670, was the lowest recorded in the past 16 years." Last month, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said he expected the company would trim its workforce over the next few years with the spread of artificial intelligence. Amazon shares are little changed in premarket trading.
