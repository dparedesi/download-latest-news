ByBill Sarubbi, Contributor. The market is likely to close the year at new highs. Here is the reasoning: Edgar Laurence Smith described the decennial pattern in the 1930s. He found that specific years in each decade had brought regular stock market patterns. For example, years ending in zero had the worst returns while years ending in five have had the best. Years ending in seven have tended to bring crises. The histogram of expected return below details the strength of fifth years based upon the Dow Jones average from 1885. As we can see, the remainder of 2025 has a bullish bias. 1-Dow Jones Monthly Histogram in Years Ending In Five September has historically been the weakest month of the year. However, the ‘five’ influence tends to keep the bear away in the autumn. Here are the bullish percentages (the likelihood that the market will rise) for autumn months for the DJIA since 1885: As we can see, this viewpoint projects higher prices in September-October. Which of the Magnificent Seven stocks should be held? In order to answer this question, relative strength, seasonal and dynamic cycles are analyzed. The unique and proprietary Cycles Research Relative Strength Value screen measures all stocks on the same basis. The seven stocks are ranked below versus the NASDAQ Composite. When reading the table, keep in mind that the NASDAQ value is 97.5. So, Tesla and Apple are lagging the benchmark. NVIDIA= 109.5 Meta= 104.6 Alphabet= 103.4 Microsoft= 99.7 Amazon= 98.7 Tesla= 96.1 Apple=94.0 Analysis is concentrated on top-ranked NVIDIA. The monthly cycle has been accurate in 2025. There is a cycle peak now leading to a low in September. In fact, September has been the fourth-weakest month in any year, so both the dynamic and the seasonal cycles point to lower prices. Add to positions in late September. 2-NVDA Monthly Cycle META’s relative strength began to rise in April, making it one of the stronger stocks in this group. Price and relative strength are at new highs. The coming months have not been strong, but this is based upon only 14 years of data. Besides, the monthly cycle below rises into December. Hold the shares. 3-META Monthly Cycle Alphabet is a mixed picture. Relative strength bottomed in May but has been inconsistent since 2024. The monthly cycle is at a peak now, suggesting that the next buy point is in October. Seasonality has not been very bullish in the second half of the year. The stock is unlikely to outperform the current leaders in the Mag 7. 4-Alphabet Monthly Cycle Microsoft’s relative uptrend began in February, earlier than the other Mag 7 stocks. This stock is one of the few that features an upturn in monthly momentum. The monthly cycle tops in September and falls into yearend. The sell cycles in this stock have been less accurate than the buy signals over the last year. The conclusion is that the share price will rise into yearend but may begin to underperform the other Mag 7 members. 5-Microsoft Monthly Cycle Amazon is seasonally strong in the second half of any year, and the monthly cycle is rising. This is the best cycle combination. In fact, September and November have been two of the most bullish months over the last 28 years. This stock is likely to rise in performance into yearend. Add to positions. 6-Amazon Monthly Cycle The relative strength of Tesla actually topped in May. From now into yearend, only November has shown exceptional strength. The dynamic monthly cycle declines into September, rises into early November and then declines again. It is doubtful that this stock will rise in strength versus its Mag 7 brethren. 7-Tesla Monthly Cycle Apple has been falling in relative terms through 2025. September has been the weakest month in any year over the last 45 years, up only 35% of the time. Note that the monthly cycle peaks now and declines into yearend. All three downturns in the last 12 months have brought the shares down. Underweight or sell this stock. 8-Apple Monthly Cycle

Title: Interested In YieldMax ETFs? Here Are The 5 Best ETFs To Check Out

ByJason Kirsch, Contributor. Income-seeking investors continue hunting for yield in a market where traditional dividend stocks often fall short of expectations. Enter YieldMax ETFs—a unique breed of exchange-traded funds that use sophisticated options strategies to generate monthly distributions from high-profile growth stocks that typically don't pay dividends. These innovative funds have captured significant investor attention by promising attractive yields from companies like Tesla, Netflix and Meta. But with dozens of YieldMax offerings now available, selecting the right ones requires careful analysis of performance metrics, volatility patterns and income sustainability. This article examines five top YieldMax ETFs that deserve consideration for income-focused portfolios. YieldMax ETFs represent a specialized category of funds that seek to generate monthly income by pursuing options-based strategies on one or more underlying securities, without actually owning the underlying stocks. Instead of relying on traditional dividend payments, these funds employ synthetic covered call strategies combined with U.S. Treasury holdings to create income streams from volatile growth stocks. The strategy works by selling call options against positions that mirror the performance of popular stocks like Tesla or Amazon. When these options expire worthless or at lower values, the premiums collected become distributable income for shareholders. However, this approach comes with trade-offs—investors sacrifice unlimited upside potential in exchange for regular monthly distributions. YieldMax ETFs are designed to deliver an alternative source of income for dividend-seeking investors through a covered-call strategy, making them particularly appealing during periods when traditional income investments underperform. After analyzing performance data, asset size, yield sustainability and underlying security volatility, five YieldMax ETFs stand out as the most compelling options for income investors. This evaluation focused on funds with substantial assets under management, consistent distribution histories, and exposure to fundamentally strong underlying companies that generate sufficient option premiums. The selected funds represent different risk-reward profiles while maintaining YieldMax's core income-generation approach. Some offer more conservative yields with steadier performance, while others provide extreme income potential with correspondingly higher volatility. CONY has emerged as YieldMax's flagship fund with $1.4 billion in assets under management, making it the most extensive offering in the family. The fund targets Coinbase (COIN), capitalizing on the cryptocurrency exchange's notorious volatility to generate exceptional option premiums. With a staggering 127.73% forward yield, CONY offers income potential that dwarfs virtually all other investment options, though this comes with corresponding risks tied to crypto market fluctuations. Despite Coinbase's volatile nature, CONY has demonstrated relative stability in 2025 with a modest 1.4% year-to-date return. This performance suggests the fund's income strategy has successfully cushioned against some of the underlying stock's price swings, though investors should remember that crypto-related investments remain inherently unpredictable. The fund's substantial asset base indicates strong investor confidence and provides operational advantages through economies of scale. CONY's appeal lies in its ability to transform Coinbase's high implied volatility into consistent monthly income. While the triple-digit yield might seem unsustainable, it reflects the premium investors receive for accepting capped upside participation in one of the market's most volatile sectors. For income investors comfortable with crypto exposure, CONY represents an intriguing way to monetize volatility rather than simply enduring it. TSLY commands significant attention with $1.09 billion in assets under management, making it the second-largest YieldMax fund. The ETF focuses on Tesla (TSLA), one of the most actively traded and volatile stocks in the market. While Tesla's stock price movements have challenged the fund in 2025, resulting in a -19.5% year-to-date decline, TSLY continues generating substantial income with a 45.65% forward yield that provides meaningful compensation for price volatility. Tesla's position as an electric vehicle pioneer and its expansion into energy storage, autonomous driving and artificial intelligence create ongoing option premium opportunities. The stock's high implied volatility stems from its sensitivity to production updates, regulatory changes and CEO Elon Musk's public statements. This volatility, while creating principal risk, also generates the option premiums that fuel TSLY's distributions. Despite recent underperformance, TSLY remains relevant for investors seeking exposure to the electric vehicle revolution while generating monthly income. Tesla's long-term growth prospects in multiple high-growth sectors suggest that periods of volatility present opportunities rather than permanent impairments. For investors willing to accept Tesla's inherent unpredictability, TSLY offers a way to collect income while maintaining exposure to one of the market's most innovative companies. NFLY has delivered impressive performance in 2025, posting a 27.1% year-to-date return while maintaining a respectable 29.97% forward yield. The fund capitalizes on Netflix's position as a streaming industry leader, benefiting from the company's global expansion, content investment cycles, and subscriber growth announcements. Netflix's stock typically exhibits significant reactions to quarterly earnings reports and subscriber metrics, creating attractive option-writing opportunities. The streaming giant's volatility patterns make it well-suited for covered call strategies. Netflix often experiences sharp moves following earnings releases or major content announcements, allowing NFLY to capture premium from these price swings. The company's transition from a growth-focused model to one emphasizing profitability and free cash flow has created more predictable business patterns while maintaining enough volatility to support option strategies. NFLY's $176 million in assets under management, while smaller than CONY and TSLY, represents solid investor interest in the streaming sector's income potential. The fund offers exposure to the digital entertainment revolution while generating monthly distributions from an industry leader. For investors seeking balanced exposure to technology growth with meaningful income generation, NFLY presents an attractive middle ground between conservative and aggressive YieldMax offerings. AMZY targets Amazon (AMZN), providing income investors access to one of the world's most dominant technology companies while generating a substantial 50.45% forward yield. Amazon's diverse business model spanning e-commerce, cloud computing, advertising and logistics creates multiple volatility drivers that support robust option premiums. The fund posted a solid 6.6% year-to-date return, demonstrating resilience despite broader market uncertainties. Amazon Web Services continues driving significant profit margins while the company's e-commerce operations benefit from ongoing digital transformation trends. The stock's sensitivity to cloud growth metrics, earnings surprises and macroeconomic factors creates regular option premium opportunities. AMZY's $282 million in assets reflects growing recognition of Amazon's suitability for income-generating strategies. The fund's appeal extends beyond its impressive yield to include exposure to Amazon's long-term secular growth themes. Cloud computing, artificial intelligence and digital advertising represent multi-trillion-dollar markets where Amazon maintains leading positions. AMZY allows investors to participate in these growth trends while receiving substantial monthly distributions, creating a compelling combination for those seeking both income and growth potential from a single investment. FBY focuses on Meta Platforms (META), delivering strong 2025 performance with a 16.1% year-to-date return alongside a 34.06% forward yield. Meta's transformation from a social media company to a "metaverse" and artificial intelligence leader has created significant stock volatility, particularly around quarterly earnings and major product announcements. This volatility provides excellent raw material for FBY's covered call strategy. Meta's substantial investments in virtual reality, augmented reality and AI infrastructure create ongoing uncertainty about future profitability timelines, leading to stock price fluctuations that benefit option strategies. The company's core advertising business remains highly profitable, providing fundamental support while newer initiatives drive volatility. FBY's $177 million in assets indicates solid investor interest in monetizing Meta's transformation story. The fund offers exposure to next-generation computing platforms while generating meaningful monthly income from one of technology's most ambitious companies. Meta's position in social media, virtual reality, and artificial intelligence ensures continued relevance in the global technology landscape. FBY presents an opportunity to participate in the potential metaverse revolution while collecting substantial distributions during the uncertain transition period. Bottom Line YieldMax ETFs offer income investors a unique approach to generating monthly distributions from growth stocks that traditionally don't pay dividends. The five funds highlighted—CONY, TSLY, NFLY, AMZY, and FBY—represent the most established and liquid options in this specialized category, each offering different risk-reward profiles through exposure to leading technology and innovation companies. While these funds can generate impressive yields ranging from 30% to over 120%, investors must understand that high income comes with trade-offs, including capped upside participation and significant volatility risk. For income-focused investors comfortable with these dynamics, YieldMax ETFs provide an innovative way to harvest yield from some of the market's most dynamic companies.
