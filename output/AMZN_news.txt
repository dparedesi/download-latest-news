Title: Where Is Amazon's Stock Price Heading In 2025?

Copyright 2022 The Associated Press. All rights reserved Where is Amazon's (AMZN) stock price heading next year? Let's formulate a prediction by running through the key factors, including the company's current position, primary growth drivers, potential challenges and strategic initiatives in play. Amazon has leading market share in two industries, e-commerce retail and cloud computing, plus a third-place share in U.S. digital advertising. Here are the numbers, according to Statista: Amazon has been a strong growth story for investors since 2010. In that period, AMZN stock grew from a split-adjusted $6 to nearly $200. The climb has not been linear, however. Shareholders benefited from a big spike in late-2020, which largely held until 2022. Like several of its tech counterparts, AMZN shed value in that year, dipping enough to walk back two years of gains. After falling to nearly $80 in December 2022, AMZN stock made a rocky climb to eclipse $200 in July of this year. Investors have since pulled back from that peak and the stock now trades at just over $190.

Likely sources of growth for Amazon going forward include AWS, which will benefit from the AI boom, e-commerce sales and the rollout of advertising on Prime Video. Amazon is working to establish AWS as the first platform of choice for AI computing. That initiative involves offering customers a range of hardware and software choices at different price points. To do that, Amazon developed its own AI training and inference chips, called Trainium and Inferentia, respectively. The first generation of the in-house chips has been well-received, and Amazon expects to release updated versions later this year. As well, the company continues to enhance its software stack for AI developers. That stack includes machine-learning platforms Amazon SageMaker and Amazon Bedrock plus the generative AI coding assistant Amazon Q, among other things. On the retail side, Amazon has been working to improve delivery speed, keep prices low and expand product selection. These initiatives are gaining traction, with more customers turning to Amazon for essential goods, such as deodorant and toilet paper. This category is important because customers buy these items repeatedly. Going forward, the company is focused on reducing costs across its fulfillment network through automation and AI. Lower fulfillment costs support the three customer-oriented outcomes—faster delivery, lower costs and broader selection—that can fuel sales growth. Amazon started showing ads on Prime Video content earlier this year. The change could be an ongoing source of advertising and subscription revenue growth. The company says its ad technology can link Prime Video ad spending to sales and other outcomes, which has historically been challenging for TV advertisers. The same measurement technology can also reveal opportunities to optimize ad content for better performance. Prime subscribers can upgrade to an ad-free experience for $2.99 monthly.

Risks to watch for Amazon include rising competition in retail and cloud computing, plus a pending antitrust lawsuit filed by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Amazon was the first to offer free shipping with a subscription, but others have followed suit. The closest Prime competitor currently is Walmart+. This program includes free shipping and delivery from Walmart stores, plus discounts on gas, entertainment and fast food. The annual price of $98 undercuts Prime's yearly rate of $139. Target also launched a paid membership product this year, called Target Circle 360. Members primarily get free two-day shipping. There are additionally many other discount online retailers that compete with Amazon, either comprehensively or in specific categories. Examples include eBay, Temu and Flipkart plus Newegg for electronics and Shein for clothes. Amazon holds the top spot in cloud computing now, but Microsoft has been moving closer. The AI boom is a strong motivation to close the gap. Building out the best cloud offering for AI computing will require continued investments in infrastructure and innovation. All three of the top providers—Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet—have deep pockets, which sets the stage for an ongoing competitive battle. In September 2023, the Federal Trade Commission and 17 state attorneys general sued Amazon for illegal, anti-competitive actions in its e-commerce business. Amazon has publicly defended its practices as being in the customer's best interest. The case could ultimately force Amazon to change its business practices or restructure. Fortunately, any damaging outcomes are likely years away, which means the process is more of a concern today than the result. If the case drags on for years, it could become an expensive distraction for Amazon. According to Amazon's second quarter 2024 earnings call, strategic priorities for next year include: Analyst predictions for Amazon characterize it as one of the best stocks to buy right now. Across 41 covering analysts, 24 rate AMZN stock a strong buy. The remaining 17 are buy ratings. There are no hold, sell or strong sell ratings. The stock currently trades at about $193 per share. Analyst price targets range from $145 to $265, with a consensus of $220.59. The midpoint represents upside of about 14%. In terms of financial results, analysts expect nearly 13% revenue growth and 66% EPS growth this year. The outlook for 2025 is about 11% revenue growth and 23% EPS growth. Amazon stock has bounced back from a tough 2022, notching roughly 60% growth over the past two years. Investors have been largely positive on AMZN in 2024, except for a dip after a disappointing jobs report in early August. The S&P 500, Amazon's tech peers and many of the best ETFs followed similar trajectories. The current stock price is about 4% below AMZN's July high point of $201.20. Amazon has momentum in AWS and retail sales, which collectively provide much of its revenue and operating income. Assuming the Fed continues to lower interest rates and the U.S. economy responds well to those changes, AMZN stock could see a double-digit lift in 2025. Additionally, several of Amazon's valuation metrics are below their five-year averages, which provides an extra margin of safety. The company's P/E ratio, for example, is 46.27. That compares favorably to the five-year average P/E of 75.63. Amazon has a pesky lawsuit in play and potentially stiff competition for cloud computing and retail sales. Even so, the tech giant has business momentum that could drive double-digit appreciation over the next 12 months. Add in reasonable valuation ratios and it's easy to argue that now may be the time to add Amazon to your portfolio. Amazon's stock price in 2025 will be affected by its success in establishing AWS as the top platform choice for AI computing. Operational execution of the Project Kuiper satellite internet project may also sway investors to trade AMZN stock. Analysts generally see more upside in Amazon's stock price than Microsoft or Apple. Nvidia and Alphabet, however, are predicted to outpace Amazon over the next year. The Federal Trade Commission has filed an antitrust lawsuit against Amazon. A quick settlement is not likely, so the suit may consume resources and be a major distraction for the e-commerce retailer and cloud provider. AWS is a key profit driver for Amazon, now and in the future. Over the last 12 months, AWS contributed 16% of Amazon's net sales and 60% of the company's operating income. Amazon is a good buy for long-term investors. The stock is volatile in the short term, but the diversification of Amazon's business model and brand recognition within multiple sectors are positives.

Title: Oracle's Stock is Red Hot. So Why Is Wall Street Divided?

Could Oracle (ORCL) be this year’s next big AI-fueled hypergrowth story? It's already had a blockbuster 2024. After a recent runup powered by an upbeat AI-fueled outlook, the database giant has become the second best-performing tech stock in the S&P 500 of the year—trailing only AI chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA). The surge has thrilled shareholders and enriched founder Larry Ellison, who is in a nip-and-tuck race with Amazon's (AMZN) Jeff Bezos to be the world’s second-richest person. But while some hot stocks get the full backing of Wall Street, analysts are divided about what's next for Oracle. The mean price target on Oracle's shares is currently $174.67, according to Visible Alpha, only a modest 4% above Friday's close. Oracle, with a client base that includes Fortune 500 companies as well as governments, remains one of the world’s leading database enterprise companies, though it faces rising competition from newer rivals in an increasingly cloud-centric environment. And there is plenty of support for Oracle out there, with more than half of the analysts tracked by Visible Alpha currently sporting "buy" ratings on the shares. Jefferies analysts said they believe Oracle could be "getting its mojo back” after attending the company’s recent CloudWorld event, where the tech stalwart said it expects sales to nearly double in the next five years on AI-driven demand for cloud services. Bernstein called Oracle their “top investment idea” after the event, citing Oracle’s cloud services growth, AI vision, and the shift of its flagship database business to the cloud, writing that “the sun shines in the Oracle Cloud.” Recent agreements with Big Three cloud providers Amazon, Microsoft (MSFT), and Alphabet’s (GOOGL) Google, as well as its "AI-first cloud architecture" could also play a role in helping Oracle support growth, according to Melius analysts, who see those partnerships as a signal that those companies "need to work with Oracle to keep driving their own Cloud segment growth to please investors." Bernstein analysts said the partnerships could also give Oracle opportunities to introduce its services to new customers, as well as sell existing customers on a wider range of offerings. “Now that the train has left the station, we believe investors will continue to reward Oracle for faster revenue growth,” Melius analysts wrote. Some analysts, however, expressed skepticism about Oracle's ability to deliver on its new growth targets and suggested they could leave the company little room for error. At Oracle's annual briefing for financial analysts, the company said it expects its revenue will rise to at least $104 billion by fiscal 2029, nearly doubling the $53 billion Oracle reported in June for fiscal 2024. The company also raised its sales projection for fiscal 2026 to at least $66 billion, up from an earlier $65 billion. Both of those figures were well ahead of the analyst consensus compiled by Visible Alpha. Citi analysts called the new targets "aggressive" and said Oracle could be “reaching for the sky" with its projections. "It's hard for us to underwrite," they wrote. "We're comfortable on the sidelines.”
