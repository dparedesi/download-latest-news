Title: Wall Street to Big Tech: Show us the AI money
URL: https://qz.com/microsoft-meta-apple-amazon-google-ai-tech-stocks-1851687080
Time Published: 2024-11-01T11:23:06Z

For tech’s biggest players, this earnings season is starting to feel like a scene from the movie Jerry Maguire — and the “show me the money” demands aren’t working out any better than they did for Tom Cruise. Some analysts are even dubbing this the “show me the money” quarter, as Wall Street’s patience with massive AI spending begins to wear thin. A tech stock selloff deepened Thursday as investors confronted the mounting costs of Silicon Valley’s artificial intelligence ambitions. Microsoft (MSFT) stock plunged 6% and Facebook parent Meta (META) tumbled 4% after the companies reported earnings late Wednesday. And in after-hours trading Thursday following their own earnings releases, Amazon (AMZN) stock dropped more than 3% and Apple (AAPL) fell 2% — despite all four companies reporting strong quarterly profits. (Some of the stocks were edging back up in pre-market trading on Friday.) Almost two years after ChatGPT kicked off Silicon Valley’s AI gold rush, this week’s tech earnings revealed both the promise and the staggering price tag of the AI revolution. While companies reported significant gains from AI initiatives —Meta’s ad prices up 11%, Google Cloud revenue surging 35% to $11.4 billion, Amazon’s AWS growing 19% to $27.5 billion — their warnings about future spending sparked a broad market retreat. Meta expects capital expenditures of up to $40 billion next year, Microsoft cautioned about ongoing OpenAI losses and slowing cloud growth, and even Apple, making its first careful steps into AI with its Apple Intelligence rollout this week, saw investors retreat — despite record revenue of $94.9 billion. Tech executives’ unwavering faith in AI’s potential stands in stark contrast to investors’ growing anxiety about the costs. “First, it’s clear that there are a lot of new opportunities to use new AI advances to accelerate our core business that should have strong ROI over the next few years,” Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told investors. Amazon chief Andy Jassy struck a similar note: “I think we’ve proven over time that we can drive enough operating income and free cash flow to make this a very successful return on invested capital business. We expect the same thing will happen here with generative AI.” Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella emphasized “AI-driven transformation.” And earlier in the week, Google (GOOGL) chief Sundar Pichai highlighted “extraordinary momentum.” But while tech leaders speak confidently about long-term returns, the market is increasingly focused on the short-term price tag of these ambitious visions. The mounting infrastructure costs, combined with uncertain timelines for returns, are testing investors’ patience with Silicon Valley’s spend-now-profit-later approach to innovation. Microsoft stock fell more than 6% on Thursday after executives predicted Azure’s growth would slow and warned of weaker expansion in its AI-powered cloud business. The guidance suggested that even for Microsoft, which has emerged as an early AI leader through its partnership with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, the path to AI profits may be longer and costlier than investors hoped. “AI-driven transformation is changing work, work artifacts, and workflow across every role, function, and business process,” said Nadella, whose company saw total revenue rise 16% to $65.6 billion. Microsoft’s overall cloud revenue climbed 22% to $38.9 billion, but the company expects growth in its intelligent cloud segment to slow to 18-20% next quarter. At Google parent Alphabet, Pichai pointed to new AI features in Search and Cloud as key growth drivers helping push revenue up 15% to $88.3 billion. Google Cloud’s profit jumped to $1.9 billion from $266 million a year earlier, suggesting the company is finding ways to monetize its AI investments. Meta leveraged AI to revitalize its core advertising business, with revenue jumping 19% to $40.6 billion. The company forecast fourth-quarter revenue between $45 billion and $48 billion, above analysts’ expectations. But CFO Susan Li warned of a “significant acceleration in infrastructure expense growth next year” due to the “back-end weighted nature” of 2024 capital expenditures and expanding AI infrastructure. The massive spending plans highlight how AI’s transformation of the tech industry remains in its early stages. While the technology is beginning to deliver measurable business results, tech giants are betting billions that the real payoff still lies ahead — and asking investors for patience. Goldman Sachs (GS) has recently expressed concerns that while AI has the potential for significant efficiency gains in certain areas, the high costs associated with developing and maintaining AI systems could outweigh the benefits in many cases — potentially making it more expensive than simply hiring human workers for certain tasks. With robust cash positions and strong core businesses, these companies appear able to sustain their AI investments even as costs mount. But the market reaction to Microsoft’s and Meta’s warnings serves as a reminder that even for tech’s strongest players, the AI revolution is proving to be an increasingly expensive proposition with an uncertain timeline for returns. Like Jerry Maguire’s demanding client in the 1996 film, Wall Street’s message to Silicon Valley is getting clearer by the day. As a Bank of America (BAC) report puts it: “We expect AI to transition from a ‘tell me’ to a ‘show me’ story, with any disconnect between investments and revenue generation to come under increased scrutiny.” Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.

Title: The American Consumer’s Surprising Strength
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/10/31/the-american-consumers-surprising-strength/
Time Published: 2024-11-01T02:14:02Z

What’s surprised most economists this year hasn’t been the magnitude and direction of rate cuts, but rather the resilience of the American consumer. Spending has continued to be robust, despite elevated rates pressuring pocketbooks. We believe consumer spending will continue, even though credit card debt levels have risen and excess Covid era savings appear to be spent. In fact, we believe there’s a possibility consumer spending could surprise to the upside. Wealthier Americans with lower debt-to-income ratios are positioned well to sustain or increase their spending patterns. This group is responsible for a majority of American discretionary spending. Furthermore, while lower-income households face some stress right now, their financial conditions are poised to loosen as rates come down and inflation comes under control. If the outlook on the consumer starts to shift, we could see consumer discretionary names start to become investment opportunities. In particular we would point to retail businesses who have spent time building brand loyalty and catering to evolving consumer preferences. Over time these discretionary business models can become American staples. NEW YORK - AUGUST 5: Beverage cups featuring the logo of Starbucks Coffee are seen in the new ... [+] flagship store on 42nd Street August 5, 2003 in New York City. The Seattle-based coffee company has emerged as the largest food chain in the Manhattan borough of New York with 150 outlets. (Photo by Stephen Chernin/Getty Images) The first thing most people look at when talking about consumer health is credit card balances. Credit card debt in the U.S. reached $1.14 trillion in Q2 2024, a record high. However, while credit card balances are at all-time highs, it’s important to note that consumer debt service payments, excluding mortgages, make up 5.6% of disposable income – a number that’s in line with historical averages. If consumer debt grows in-line with GDP and incomes, then the all-time highs are a natural by-product of our nation’s record-setting growth coming out of the pandemic. Record high credit card debts are okay if they’re growing in line with the rest of the economy and debt service costs are manageable. Also worth noting is the composition of spending. While lower-income households carry a much higher credit card balance relative to their income, wealthier Americans are generally the primary driver of consumer spending. This groups ability to spend remains relatively healthy. High income households have seen a 17% increase in inflation adjusted retail spending since 2018. This is important because the top income quintile makes up 40% of personal consumption, and personal consumption makes up approximately 60% of domestic GDP. Lower income households are under more pressure. Their spending has still risen since 2018, middle income up 13.3% and lower income by 7.9%, but the spending growth lags that of their wealthier peers. This group is burdened by relatively heavier debt loads and are more exposed to inflationary pressures. Price increases have eroded their purchasing power, and rate hikes have hampered these groups’ access to credit. However, these groups are starting to see some light at the end of the tunnel. Inflation appears to be moderating, with core PCE at 2.7% in September. Wage growth is also moderating, but not as quickly. Real wage growth was back in positive territory in September, clocking in at 1.8%. Furthermore, positive wage growth was especially strong for moderate wage earners. Finally, with inflation abating the Fed can finally start to reduce interest rates, bringing a degree of debt relief to millions of Americans carrying credit card balances or other adjustable rate debts. SAN FRANCISCO - FEBRUARY 09: A sign stands outside of a McDonald's restaurant February 9, 2009 in ... [+] San Francisco, California. Fast food chain restaurant McDonald's reported a 7.1 percent increase in same store sales for January as people look towards cheaper food alternatives in the weakening economy. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) The American consumer has been under stress, but it’s not like they stopped spending completely. We believe brands that have tried to work with the stressed consumer through this recent period of instability stand to benefit significantly as the tide for the consumer begins to turn. Think about a company like McDonald’s (MCD) – to attract customers wanting a better deal eating out, they’ve had to rely extensively on promotional offers. These promotional offers aren’t big profit engines, but the traffic during hard times helps build brand familiarity and form habits. When times are better and consumers can afford more, McDonald’s benefits from having expanded their consumer base. This kind of growth in bad times sets up the company for success when the economy is expanding. Companies like McDonalds are also trying to innovate to cement their position in a consumer’s lives by rolling out loyalty rewards programs and gamified applications. Businesses are willing to offer discounts or promotions through their apps because it helps build consumer habits and the data the businesses can get back about app usage gives them valuable information about which discounts or promotions are effective. Building habits and establishing a consistent customer base is key for helping companies sell more product, expand into new markets, and overcome disruptions to their consumer base or to their business model. Providing the customer with value and consistency also sometimes requires simplicity. Focused marketing and a simple product can be a really effective way to build brand loyalty. Take Chipotle (CMG) and Starbucks (SBUX) for example – CEO Brian Niccol took the reins of the global coffee chain in September and has preached simplicity. A simpler and cheaper menu. An app that’s easier to navigate. A reversion back to being the neighborhood coffee shop. It’s just a simple focus on coffee! Before Starbucks, Niccol took Chipotle’s stock to all-time highs with its cost-efficient and customizable menu – all while limiting the complexity of actually making a burrito. Minimalism kept internal costs down and allowed the company to offer a better product at a better price. Keeping it simple and consistent can help consumers feel like they’re not splurging on lunch or their morning coffee and can lead to recession-proof earnings for the underlying businesses. Positioning yourself as a value option with a simple business model can also work outside of the food and beverage space. Look at apparel retailers. They have also benefited from a shift to preferences for value amid rising costs, especially among Gen Z and millennial shoppers. Retail stores where consumers can “trade down” are essential to maintaining consumer spending when times get tough. Think about companies like TJX Companies (TJX) and Burlington (BURL) – clothing retailers who have been taking market share from department stores for years and continue to look more like consumer staples rather than being discretionary names. Retail isn’t even close to dead here, as shoppers can still pick out branded items but at a steep discount. Where American’s aren’t opting for cost savings, they are opting for convenience. Think about mini splurges like ordering take out. DoorDash Inc (DASH) has continued to see robust growth among its users even as the broader economy has faced spending challenges. There are two angles to the success. First, on the consumer side, food delivery apps are becoming normalized. It’s becoming habitual, just like a morning stop at the local coffee shop. This habit building starts with meal orders, but the opportunity set for companies in the space is much wider. They’re solving last mile logistics for everything from meals to groceries to pharmaceutical goods to packages. Second, on the worker side of the equation, the gig-economy gives people another way to earn a bit of money to fund their habits. It doesn’t have the commitment of a second job and it’s flexible, but still gives people an easy way to earn money when times would otherwise be tough. Finally, it’s important to be cognizant of how broad the consumer space is. Not every company that has a consumer facing arm is necessarily dependent on the consumer for its growth. A prime example of this would be a company like Amazon (AMZN). Amazon is a huge consumer shopping platform so it gets categorized as a consumer discretionary type of name. But someone like Amazon also has other divisions. In particular, Amazon’s AWS division is one of the largest hyperscale cloud providers in the world and consistently generates a substantial portion of the company’s operating income – a far cry from being a simple consumer oriented e-commerce business. On the other hand, a company like an American Express or Visa get classified as financials, but they still depend on consumer spending and on brand loyalty to make money. We think businesses offering discounts to Americans burdened by higher inflation and interest expenses are likely to keep building loyalty among their customers. Building loyalty now should pay off in the future when the consumer’s financial situation begins to improve. Furthermore, businesses need to streamline and adapt to new consumer preferences for value and convenience. Investors should keep a close eye on businesses with the potential to break away from dependency on the economic cycle and which assert themselves as American staples. One Community. Many Voices.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. The Nasdaq led a tumble in US stocks on Thursday after Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) earnings sparked worries about prospects for Big Techs amid rising artificial intelligence costs. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) sank 2.7%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell nearly 1.9%, as both indexes ended the month slightly in the red. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) also notched a monthly loss after dropping 0.9% on Thursday. The monthly declines snapped five straight months of gains for the S&P 500 and Dow. Optimism for a Big Tech boost to stocks took a knock as investors digested Meta's and Microsoft's quarterly reports. While the results beat Wall Street estimates, both companies flagged that they will step up already high spending on AI infrastructure. Concerns that would put pressure on profitability helped send shares in both Meta and Microsoft lower. The unsettled mood spread to Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL), which rounded off this week's "Magnificent Seven" earnings with reports after the close on Thursday. AI darling Nvidia (NVDA) also fell over 4.5%. After the bell, the mood around Amazon improved, as its stock popped after the tech giant topped Wall Street's estimates for both revenue and earnings per share. Meanwhile, Apple shares slid slightly as a one-time charge related to the reversal of a European General Court decision weighed on the company's earnings per share. On the macroeconomic front, investors received the latest reading on the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, which largely matched expectations. The reading is the last key inflation input for the Federal Reserve before its policy decision next week. Read more: What the Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards In jobs-related data, initial jobless claims declined to a five-month low of 216,000, lower than estimates. Next up is the all-important jobs report on Friday. Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley reports: Apple (AAPL) announced its fourth quarter earnings on Thursday, giving Wall Street its first look at whether the company’s Apple Intelligence platform is juicing iPhone sales. For the quarter, Apple saw earnings per share (EPS) of $0.97 on revenue of $94.9 billion. The company says it saw a one-time charge related to the reversal of a European General Court decision that requires Apple to pay 13 billion euros to Ireland for back taxes. Without the charge, EPS would have come in at $1.64. That would have blown past expectations of $1.59 per share and revenue of $94.3 billion. The company reported EPS of $1.46 on revenue of $89.4 billion during the same period last year. Read more here. Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley reports: Intel (INTC) reported its Q3 earnings after the bell on Thursday beating expectations on revenue, but falling short on earnings per share due to impairment charges. But positive Q4 guidance and a beat on data center revenue helped send the stock higher by as much as 12% following the report. For the quarter, Intel saw a loss per share of $0.46 on revenue of $13.28 billion. Analysts were anticipating a loss per share of $0.03 on revenue of $13 billion. That’s down from the earnings of $0.41 per share and revenue of $14.1 billion the company saw in the same quarter last year. Read more here. Amazon (AMZN) stock popped as much as 5% after the company reported stronger revenue and earnings per share for the third quarter than Wall Street expected. The company also said it expects revenue in a range of $181.5 billion to $188.5 billion in the fourth quarter. Analysts had forecasted $186.36 billion in revenue for the quarter. Meanwhile, Amazon said Operating income is expected to be between $16.0 billion and $20.0 billion during the fourth quarter. Wall treet had projected $17.49 billion. Read more here. Big Tech led Thursday's losses, with all three averages ending lower. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) sank 2.7%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell nearly 1.9%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) notched a monthly loss, dropping 0.9%. All three averages closed out October slightly in the red. Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) earnings sparked worries about prospects for Big Tech amid rising artificial intelligence costs, with those stocks losing more than 4% and 6%, respectively. All of the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks fell, with Al chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) dropping more than 4.5%. A slew of tech earnings are set to hit the tape again after the bell. Below is what Wall Street is expecting: Amazon: Amazon is expected to report earnings per share of $1.16 on revenue of $157.29 billion. Read the full preview. Apple: For the quarter, Wall Street expects Apple to report earnings per share (EPS) of $1.59 on revenue of $94.3 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Read the full preview. Intel: For the quarter, Intel is expected to report a loss per share of $0.03 on revenue of $13 billion. That’s down from the earnings of $0.41 per share and revenue of $14.1 billion the company saw in the same quarter last year. Read the full preview. Both Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) topped Wall Street's estimates for revenue and earnings per share. But both also talked about ramping up spending on artificial intelligence, which appeared to weigh on sentiment as each stock slumped about 5% on Thursday. Microsoft's capital expenditures picked up to $20 billion in the most recent quarter from $19 billion the quarter prior. CFO Amy Hood said the company is ramping up investments in response to "AI demands." The company did, however, note that the extra spend is weighing on Microsoft's margins. For its part, Meta raised the lower end of its guidance range for full-year capital expenditures from $37 billion to $38 billion, and CFO Susan Li made a rather ambiguous statement about spending plans moving forward, saying the company expects "significant capital expenditure growth in 2025." The chart below shows a clear trend in growing capital expenditures. The companies say it's going to drive future revenues. For now, the market appears not to love it. But whether it will work in the long run remains a looming question that doesn't have a clear answer. RBC Capital analyst Rishi Jaluria wrote about Microsoft on Thursday, “While investors may be hung up on the optics of decelerating Azure growth paired with substantial CapEx, we see a path to upward revisions, and would be a buyer on weakness." The October jobs report is expected to show job gains slowed significantly during the month as recent hurricanes and a strike by Boeing workers weigh on the labor market. The monthly report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, slated for release at 8:30 a.m. ET on Friday, is expected to show nonfarm payrolls rose by 105,000 in October while the unemployment rate held flat at 4.1%, according to consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg. This would mark the lowest monthly number of job additions since December 2020. In September, the US economy shocked Wall Street by adding 254,000 jobs, well above consensus estimates. The unemployment rate declined to 4.1%. Here are the key numbers Wall Street will be looking at on Friday morning compared to the previous month, according to data from Bloomberg: Read more here. Yahoo Finance's Claire Boston reports: Mortgage rates rose for a fifth straight week as pre-election volatility continued to rock the bond market. The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 6.72% in the week through Wednesday, according to Freddie Mac data, up from 6.54% a week earlier. 15-year mortgage rates also increased to 5.99% from 5.71% a week ago. Read more here. Technology stocks led the overall market declines on Thursday. The S&P 500 Technology Sector (XLK) ETF slid 2.8% by mid-session. AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) was down more than 4% along with other semiconductor stocks. Among Big Tech's declinersoftware giant Microsoft (MSFT) fell more than 5% following its quarterly results. Social media company Meta (META) fell roughly 4% after indicating it will step up spending on AI infrastructure next year. Amazon (AMZN), set to report earnings after the bell, also dropped more than 3%. Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) extended its double-digit declines on Thursday as the stock reversed sizable gains from earlier in the week. Shares fell around 15% and trading was briefly halted due to volatility. As Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal reports, the massive swings come as the stock suffered its largest percent decline on Wednesday after shares plunged around 22%. Since Tuesday, more than $3 billion has been shaved from the company's market cap, although the stock is still up roughly 130% from its September lows. Read more here. Super Micro Computer (SMCI) stock dropped nearly 14%, extending declines of 33% in the prior session to erase all of its year-to-date gains, as some Wall Street analysts backed away from covering the stock after accounting firm Ernst & Young resigned during the company's audit. On Thursday, Argus downgraded the server maker to Hold from Buy, with no price target. Meanwhile analysts at Needham and Wells Fargo suspended coverage of the company. Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal reports: Comcast (CMCSA) said Thursday that it has started exploring spinning off its cable networks into a separate company. The development comes as the media industry undergoes massive disruption, with more consumers cutting the cord, or dropping their pay-TV packages. Comcast stock rose more than 2% on Thursday morning. Read more here. Stocks accelerated their losses on Thursday as the Nasdaq (^IXIC) dropped as much as 2% with technology sliding. Among the biggest laggards, Nvidia (NVDA) sank 4% while Microsoft (MSFT) and Broadcom (AVGO) also fell 4%. Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian reports: Stellantis (STLA) reported third quarter revenue and shipments that missed estimates, though the company said it's making "progress addressing operational issues." The stock gained more than 3% in early trading on Thursday. Read more here. Tech stocks led the major averages lower on Thursday following quarterly results from social media giant Meta (META) and software maker Microsoft (MSFT). The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) sank 0.7%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell over 0.7%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) dropped roughly 0.5%. Meta said it would increase capital spending significantly in 2025, while Microsoft's cloud growth forecast disappointed Wall Street as the company races to expand its AI infrastructure. Meta (META) and Microsoft (MSFT) stocks sank premarket as investors weighed their hefty artificial intelligence expenditures against the time it will take to generate a return on their investment. Meta fell as much as 4.7% before paring losses, while Microsoft was down 3.6%. During their earnings reports the night before, both companies beat Wall Street’s expectations, but Microsoft’s weaker-than-expected sales guidance for the current quarter and Meta’s raised outlook on capital expenditures appeared to spook investors. Meta raised the lower end of its guidance range for full-year spending from $37 billion to $38 billion, and CFO Susan Li said the company expects “significant capital expenditure growth in 2025.” Microsoft indicated in its fiscal first quarter earnings reports that spending on general artificial intelligence infrastructure (e.g., AI chips) weighed on gross margins, which it expects to continue in the current period. Microsoft justified the spending by saying the demand for its AI products is real and that infrastructure spending is necessary to continue to meet that demand. “Roughly half of our cloud and AI-related spend continues to be for long-lived assets that will support monetization over the next 15 years and beyond,” said Microsoft CFO Amy Hood. Meta said it’s seeing “rapid adoption of Meta AI.” RBC Capital analyst Rishi Jaluria said to buy the dip on Microsoft: “While investors may be hung up on the optics of decelerating Azure growth paired with substantial CapEx, we see a path to upward revisions.” Analysts also reiterated their Buy ratings on Meta stock.

And I will tell you why: new CEO Brian Niccol. I have known Niccol for about 10 years, going back to his time leading Taco Bell at Yum! Brands (YUM). One thing among many that I have noticed about him is how he really digs into problems and calmly articulates them — and an action plan — to team members and investors. That was the same Niccol who senior reporter Brooke DiPalma and I encountered last night in a 15-minute post-earnings call phone chat. Such calm under fire will prove to be a good thing for Starbucks, as it has many, many problems to address. Niccol seemingly has more knowledge about Starbucks in his first three months than the prior CEO gained in more than a year! He is wasting no time fixing things at Starbucks, as Brooke reports here. But here is one exchange I had with him on the phone regarding the need to slash the menu size by 25% or more. Cutting the Starbucks menu down is vitally important to driving a better business on the top and bottom lines. It's good to see Niccol understand this (he made it a point to keep the Chipotle (CMG) menu small, carefully introducing a new item or two a year after thorough testing), as his predecessors never did.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 250 points Thursday mid-morning, alongside sharp Nasdaq and S&P 500 declines, following earnings reports from Microsoft (MSFT+0.77%) and Meta (META+1.64%), as both tech giants grapple with challenges in meeting the surging demand for AI. Meta stock fell about 3% in Thursday trading, while Microsoft stock dropped more than 5%. Super Micro Computer (SMCI+2.73%) stock continued to fall following the resignation of Ernst & Young, the company’s auditor, and now it faces potential delisting from the Nasdaq Shares of crypto-friendly companies like Coinbase (COIN+4.61%), MicroStrategy (MSTR+3.90%), and Robinhood (HOOD+2.28%) also slipped after releasing their earnings a day earlier. In afternoon trading, the Dow was down 248 points, or 0.5%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq slumped 421 points, or 2.2%. The S&P 500 was down 1.4%. Positive news on the economic front came in the form of a significant drop in U.S. initial unemployment claims to a five-month low, indicating a resilient labor market. The Labor Department reported Thursday that initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell by 12,000 to a seasonally adjusted 216,000 for the week ending Oct. 26, surpassing economists’ expectations of 230,000 claims. And inflation continues to cool, as the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index — the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge — showed a 2.1% year-over-year increase for September, down from 2.3% in August, according to data released Thursday. This inflation slowdown, almost all the way to the Fed’s target of 2% annual inflation, was a hopeful signal for consumers and the Fed alike as it plans to continue cutting interest rates. Investors will be watching Apple (AAPL+0.34%) and Amazon (AMZN+1.59%) earnings after the closing bell. Apple’s (AAPL+0.34%) fourth-quarter report Thursday will be the first glimpse into sales since Apple unveiled its latest slate of iPhones and new artificial intelligence features, known as Apple Intelligence, at its annual event in early September — and Wall Street is expecting a strong quarter of yearly growth. Analysts are expecting earnings per share of $1.60 for Apple’s fourth fiscal quarter, according to estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS+1.52%). Net income is projected to reach $24.24 billion, which would represent more than 5% growth from the same period a year ago. Apple has had a strong year over all. Its shares are up about 25% year-to-date, just beating the S&P 500 index. Amazon is set to report third-quarter earnings on Thursday, after slightly missing expectations in its last quarter. The retail and cloud giant is expected to report revenues of $157.3 billion for the quarter ended in September, according to analyst estimates compiled by FactSet. Amazon is expected to report earnings per share, or EPS, of $1.14. In the last quarter, the company issued lower-than-expected guidance for the third quarter, setting revenue expectations between $154 and $158.5 billion — or between 8% and 11% year over year growth. In the second quarter, Amazon reported revenues of $148 billion — a 10% increase from the previous year, but still below expectations of $148.7 billion, according to FactSet. However, the company reported net income of $13.5 billion in the second quarter, which was above expectations of $11 billion. Amazon Web Services, Amazon’s cloud-computing division, reported $26.3 billion in revenue, which was up 19% year over year. – Rocio Fabbro and Britney Nguyen contributed to this article.
