We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Stocks rose on Thursday to kick off the first trading day of the new year as Wall Street returned from holiday. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) edged up 0.4%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose above the flat line. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) gained 0.4% after markets reopened from Wednesday's closure. Markets are eyeing a comeback after a year-end slide to begin the week dented hopes for a "Santa Claus rally." The decline capped a blowout 2024 for US stocks that saw the S&P 500 (^GSPC) post two years in a row of over-20% gains — something it hasn't achieved in almost three decades. Several Big Tech stocks led the market higher with shares of Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) all rising as optimism around artificial intelligence crept back in. Investors have been debating what role the "Magnificent Seven" stocks will play in powering markets in 2025 after their massive outperformance last year. But Tesla (TSLA) shares slid almost 6% after the electric vehicle maker posted its first decline in annual deliveries on Thursday morning. Also in focus was news that a Cybertruck loaded with firework mortars and fuel canisters exploded in Las Vegas on Wednesday, killing one person. The FBI is investigating whether the blast outside the Trump International Hotel was an act of terrorism. Over the holiday week, US mortgage rates rose to 6.97% to reach the highest level since early July, data showed. The gain weighed on applications for home purchases and dented refinancing, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Weekly jobless claims fell to their lowest level since March. Data released by the Department of Labor on Thursday morning showed claims of 211,000, a decrease from the previous week's upwardly revised level of 220,000. On the corporate front, Apple (AAPL) shares fell around 2% after the iPhone maker offered rare price discounts on its latest models in China, reflecting rising competition from local handset makers. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) erased early morning gains to hover near the flat line by 11:30 a.m. ET on Thursday. A fall in shares of Boeing (BA) weighed on the blue-chip index. The industrial giant's stock dropped as much as 3.5% following Sunday's deadly crash of a 737-800 aircraft operated by Jeju Air in South Korea. Analysts were however quick to point out it's unlikely that the incident was related to Boeing's production challenges last year. Apple (AAPL) shares fell to session lows after the iPhone maker offered rare discounts on its latest devices in China. A man alleged to be linked to the explosion of a Tesla (TSLA) Cybertruck filled with fireworks and gasoline in Las Vegas was a US soldier, according to a report from CNN. "The man connected to the rental of the Tesla Cybertruck that exploded outside of the Trump Hotel in Las Vegas on Wednesday is a US Special Forces soldier assigned to 10th Special Forces Group, per 4 US officials," CNN correspondent Natasha Bertrand wrote on X. "The man is a US Army special forces operations sergeant, holding the rank of master sergeant, a senior enlisted rank, the officials said. Three officials said he was on active duty and was on leave from Germany, where he was serving with 10th Group, at the time of the incident," said the posting. The Cybertruck had been rented on an app called Turo, the same service used to rent the vehicle involved in running over a crowd of people in New Orleans early Wednesday morning. Authorities are investigating whether there is any link between the two incidents. Tesla shares slid almost 6% on Thursday morning after the EV giant posted its first annual delivery decline. The stock is down roughly 18% over the past five trading sessions. Shares of Tesla hit all-time highs in mid-December on the heels of a massive rally following Donald Trump's White House victory in early November. Shares of Cloudflare (NET) jumped more than 5% on Thursday after the cloud platform company received a double upgrade from Goldman Sachs. The analysts said they see a 28% upside for the stock and raised their price target to $140. They upgraded the stock to a Buy from a Sell recommendation. Goldman analysts cited "improving sales and marketing productivity cycle" and "new AI inferencing use cases" AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) rose more than 2% to lead the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) higher on Thursday morning. Other "Magnificent Seven" stocks also helped lift the tech-heavy index, with Meta (META) and Amazon (AMZN) rising almost 2%. Meanwhile, shares of Tesla (TSLA) pared some of the losses that came after the EV giant posted its first annual decline in deliveries. The stock fell by as much as 6% in early trading. Apple's (AAPL) stock also came off session lows. The iPhone maker has offered rare price discounts on its latest models in China, highlighting rising competition from local device makers. Stocks rose on the first trading day of the new year following a holiday break and a roaring 2024 for the markets. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) jumped 0.5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.6%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped but quickly erased early session gains. Tesla (TSLA) stock dropped after the electric vehicle giant said it delivered 495,570 vehicles in the fourth quarter of last year, making 2024 the first year of a decline in annual deliveries since 2011, according to Bloomberg data. Tesla (TSLA) stock dropped 3% in premarket trading after the electric vehicle giant said it delivered 495,570 vehicles in the fourth quarter of 2024, bringing total deliveries to roughly 1.79 million for the whole year. Wall Street analysts expected the automaker to deliver roughly 512,300 EVs for the last three months of the year, or about 1.8 million vehicles, In the fourth quarter, Tesla said it produced approximately 459,000 vehicles. Tesla (TSLA) stock rose more than 1% premarket as investors prepared for the Elon Musk-led electric vehicle maker to release its fourth quarter deliveries Thursday. Wall Street analysts expect the company to report deliveries of roughly 512,300 EVs for the period, bringing its annual deliveries for the 2024 fiscal year to 1.8 million EVs, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. If the average analyst forecast holds true, that would mean Tesla's annual EV deliveries fell 0.3% from the prior year — making 2024 the first year since 2011 that Tesla EV sales failed to grow, according to Bloomberg data. Tesla shares fell more than 3% on the last day of 2024 as megacap tech stocks lagged, but the EV company's stock was still up more than 60% for the year. Tesla had warned in 2023 that production growth would be "notably lower" in the year ahead, as Pras Subramanian noted in his roundup of Tesla's biggest news in 2024 (you can read that story here).

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks slipped Tuesday, closing 2024 with an uncharacteristic down note after a roaring year of trading. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell 0.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) dropped just below the flatline, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the losses at 0.9%. Despite the sour final stretch, the benchmark S&P 500 closed 2024 up 23%, according to Yahoo Finance data. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained almost 30%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average posted a more modest 13% win. The S&P's annual gain roughly matches 2023's performance, logging the highest consecutive back-to-back annual gain in nearly 30 years. The major indexes posted big wins in 2024, a year that was marked by a continued surge in the artificial intelligence trade — led by the "Magnificent Seven" stocks — even as the bull rally broadened across the board. The single biggest winner in the S&P was Palantir (PLTR), with a nearly 350% gain for the year, while the biggest loser was Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) which gave up 64% of its value. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve made its first interest rate cut in four years, and President-elect Donald Trump's impending return to the White House drove stocks higher in the last two months. (Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer and Alexandra Canal have a great rundown of the year's big themes in charts.) In commodities, gold (GC=F) increased 28% this year, logging its biggest yearly gain since 2010. And in cryptocurrencies, bitcoin (BTC-USD) has rallied over 100% this year, though it has pulled back from the $100,000 level it breached earlier this month. But overall, the good times have stalled in the last week, as markets have given up some of their big gains — all the more uncharacteristic considering the typical "Santa Claus" rally that marks the end of the year. US stocks slipped Tuesday, closing 2024 with an uncharacteristic down note after a roaring year of trading. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell 0.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) dropped just below the flatline, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) led the losses at 0.9%. Despite the weak final stretch, the benchmark S&P 500 closed 2024 up 23%, according to Yahoo Finance data. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained almost 30%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has posted a more modest 13% win. The S&P's annual gain roughly matches 2023's performance, logging the highest consecutive back-to-back annual gain in nearly 30 years. Super Micro Computer stock (SMCI) started 2024 reaping the rewards of an artificial intelligence darling. But the year turned out to be a bust. Shares of the AI server maker were on track to notch a yearly gain of just 6% on Tuesday afternoon — far less than other AI-themed stocks that have thrived in the bull market in 2024. And despite turning positive for the year in December, Super Micro shares remained far below their highs near $120 in mid-March. Shares began to see signs of volatility early this year as the company struggled to meet analysts' and investors' high expectations. The stock's performance became increasingly unstable in the latter half of 2024 as Super Micro grappled with the fallout from a report published by short-selling firm Hindenburg Research, accusing the server maker of accounting violations, violations of export controls, and questionable relationships between its executives and key suppliers. Read the full story here on Super Micro's wild ride this year. The Federal Reserve's stance that interest rates will remain "higher for longer" will extend into 2025, even as the central bank has cut rates three times this year, amounting to a reduction of 100 basis points. Fed Chair Powell has sad he expects inflation to remain more elevated than previously thought — that change played into officials scaling back the number of expected rate cuts to make next year from four to two. Inflation is proving to be stubborn, And with the potential for Trump to reignite pricing pressures through new economic policies, the Fed is poised to take a cautious approach with any future rate hikes. Market bets on the Fed's first policy decision of the new year predict rates to stay the same, with a roughly 90% chance, according to the CME FedWatch tool. The potential for the first cut won't come until March, according to the data. Retail investors enjoyed another banner year by sticking with tried-and-true large-cap tech names that raked in big profits and promised advances in artificial intelligence, reports Yahoo Finance's Brian Sozzi. The six corporate tickers with the most retail investor inflows were a who's who of tech momentum trades: AMD (AMD), Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Palantir (PLTR), Tesla (TSLA), and Amazon (AMZN). These five names pulled in $67.7 billion in total retail inflows this year. Nvidia overtook Tesla as the most popular stock among retail investors, at least judging by inflows. Vanda Research estimated the year will end with about $265 billion in net new inflows into US markets by self-directed retail investors. Read more about retail investor interest in 2024 here. Billionaire investor Bill Ackman is stoking new speculation that the Trump administration could end one of the oldest fights on Wall Street by loosening the federal government’s grip over Freddie Mac (FMCC) and Fannie Mae (FNMA), reports Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith. Ackman said Monday on X that "there is a credible path" for the mortgage giants to be removed from government conservatorship and made into private companies within the next two years. That could result in an initial public offering in 2026. "Trump likes big deals and this would be the biggest deal in history," added Ackman, the founder of Pershing Square Capital Management. "I am confident he will get it done." The stocks of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae — semi-acronyms for Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and the Federal National Mortgage Association — jumped in the hours after Ackman’s comments. They are now up 168% and 138%, respectively, since Donald Trump’s election win. Read more about Ackmann's theory about privatizing the mortgage giants here. The last trading day of the year is set to be a disappointment as all three major indexes slipped into the red, punctuating a year of heady gains. US stocks bounced back Tuesday, giving investors one final hurrah to cap a roaring year of trading even as the last batch of sessions limped to the finish. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell 0.4% during afternoon trading, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) shed 0.7%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) lost 0.3%. Despite the lackluster trading day the benchmark S&P 500 is up around 23.8% in 2024, according to Yahoo Finance data. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is up almost 30%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has posted a more modest 13% gain. The "Magnificent Seven" stocks, consisting of Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA), put up a blockbuster year. The major players averaged stock gains of more than 60%, far outpacing the broader market's roughly 24% yearly return. Nvidia took the top spot, rallying more than 170% and fully capitalizing on the AI mania that struck the market this year. Tesla, at a 67% gain in share price, is riding high on the Trump bump, as CEO Elon Musk has become a close adviser to the incoming president. Meta is close behind, registering a gain of 66%, punctuating a remarkable comeback story. Amazon and Alphabet are set to notch 45% and 36% gains, respectively, as both platforms leverage their cloud computing businesses to generate new revenue from AI. Apple registered a 30% increase, as bullish analysts see a "golden era" for the iPhone maker. And Microsoft rounded out the group, rising 12%. While the end of the year fizzle may have put a damper on Wall Street, if you zoom out just a little, the year showered investors with huge gains. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) is on track to post a 24% gain, matching the return from 2023. These back-to-back annual gains mark the best performance for the index since 1997 and 1998. That's the best consecutive set of yearly increases since the run-up to the dot-com bubble. And while analysts don't expect the benchmark index to log another year above 20% — as interest rates may remain elevated and corporate earnings face higher and higher expectations — 2025 is poised to be another robust year for investors. S&P 500 earnings are expected to grow 15% year over year in 2025, according to FactSet data, fueling another bullish outlook for the year ahead. President-elect Donald Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell have clashed before, and there is a chance they will do so again in 2025. Their collision could unfold in multiple ways, reports Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger. If Trump’s economic policies cause more inflation, it could force the Fed to tap the brakes and pull back any expected interest rate cuts. The new administration could make some new noise about limiting the Fed’s independence. Or Trump cost-cutter Elon Musk — who recently said the central bank is "absurdly overstaffed" — could seek to overhaul the Fed’s workforce. Powell said in December that there are still too many unknowns for the Fed to game out how Trump's proposed tariffs could impact setting rates. However, he did say that some Fed officials have begun to factor in Trump’s proposed policies into their policy assumptions.

US stocks bounced back Tuesday, giving investors one final hurrah to cap a roaring year of trading even as the last batch of sessions limped to the finish. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.2%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) gained 0.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) put on 0.2%. The benchmark S&P 500 is up around 23.8% in 2024, according to Yahoo Finance data. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite is up almost 30%.

Title: Jim Cramer Says ‘Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Is A Buy, And I Think It Will Continue To Perform Well’

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer's Bold Predictions About These 15 AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other AI stocks Jim Cramer talked about. As trading in 2024 heads towards a close, major stock market indexes have had a good run despite mixed performance across sectors. The flagship S&P index is up 26% year-to-date while the broader NASDAQ index has gained 33.56%. On top of this, the index of the NASDAQ's top 100 stocks is up 29.8%, which solidifies the conclusion that technology stocks have driven the stock market's 2024 returns. For further evidence, consider the Dow's performance. The stock index which tracks industries across the US economy is up 14% YTD, making it the weakest-performing index among all mentioned. However, even within technology, not all stocks have performed equally well. As an example, consider the performance of two stocks. Both of these are semiconductor companies. The first, which ranked 3rd on our list of Jim Cramer's bearish tech calls is the largest American manufacturer of memory chips. The second, which ranked 1st on the same list is Wall Street's AI darling. The two stocks have gained 7.64% and 184.60% year-to-date, so even though both of them are technology companies, their share price returns have differed primarily because of the firms' varying exposures to artificial intelligence. Yet even though AI has held up the stock market in 2024, other factors continue to influence stock performance as well. Continuing with our example of the GPU designer's shares, the stock dropped by 1.1% on the day the Federal Reserve cut interest rates but guided two cuts for 2024 instead of the earlier four. The shares fell despite the fact that the firm enjoys the widest moat possible in the AI industry. On the same day, the flagship S&P and the broader NASDAQ indexes shed 2.9% and 3.6%, respectively. Following the year-end sell-off on Friday, neither index has fully recovered to levels before the Fed's announcement. Cramer, for his part, had predicted that the markets might not find it easy to reverse all losses following the Fed's announcement. Talking on CNBC's Squawk on the Street on the day after the Fed's decision, the host shared that "rampant Bitcoin speculation, after speculation in nuclear power, after speculation in quantum computing" was baked into markets ahead of the announcement. Commenting on quantum computing in particular, Cramer mentioned one quantum computing stock and wondered whether the industry was all hype and no substance. "How is that [the firm] going to quantum? When we don’t even know what quantum is?" wondered Cramer. "It’s a nonfungible tokens, right? Cause you know what a fungible token was?” he added. As AI continues to shape the winners and losers in the stock market, Cramer also shared tips for trading in 2025 in a recent Mad Money episode. He believes that one key fact that everyone needs to keep in mind when trading is to not get disillusioned by strong gains. According to Cramer, while bulls and bears both "make money" on the stock market, it's the pigs that "get slaughtered." He elaborated further and shared that in his experience he's "seen moments where stocks went up and up and up so much that people were intoxicated with their gains." Yet, it's "precisely at that point of intoxication that you need to remind yourself that you don’t want to act like a pig," believes the television show host. Cramer's second tip for successful investing is to have the fortitude to hold stocks even when the market is tough. He believes that not only is holding through the thick and thin 'the hardest part of investing," but adds that "taking short-term pains so you can have long-term gains" lies at the heart of the market's performance "for a century.” Finally, one key factor that several people ignore while trading stocks is to hunt for the right entry price. Cramer cautions against buying in bulk. "Do not, under any circumstances, buy your whole position at once," he stresses and adds that "you should never sell all at once," either. Instead, Cramer recommends staging "your buys, work your orders, try to get the best price over time.” Our Methodology To compile our list of Jim Cramer's bold predictions about AI stocks, we scanned the stocks he mentioned in Mad Money and Squawk on the Street as far back as in August. Then, we picked out stocks with AI computing, hardware, and energy generation exposure, and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024. For these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.
