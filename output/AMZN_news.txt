Summary: MercadoLibre has great prospects, but it is not necessarily a great investment.
Content: MercadoLibre (MELI -0.27%), the leading e-commerce company in Latin America, has been unstoppable lately. The stock rose more than 50% in the last 12 months alone, bringing its total return to a remarkable 274% in the previous five years.
While existing investors celebrate its outstanding stock performance, potential investors may wonder if they should buy it today to participate in future growth.

MercadoLibre has been executing at a world-class level
There aren't many companies that can grow at high rates for more than two decades. While Amazon may be the most apparent growth company with such a track record, its smaller peer, MercadoLibre, is another company that has achieved that feat. To put it into perspective, the Latin American e-commerce company grew revenue from $5.6 million in 2003 to $14.5 billion in 2023.
While many factors contributed to its success, the company's solid execution over the years has been one of the main drivers. For instance, it started mainly in the e-commerce sector but has, over the years, diversified into other areas like logistics, payments, and lending. Such diversification helps improve customer satisfaction -- they can rely on one trusted platform for multiple services -- and opens up new growth avenues for the company.
Another example of MercadoLibre's remarkable execution is its geographically diversified business empire across Latin America. To achieve that, the tech company must adopt a localized approach to managing its operations since countries within the region have different languages, cultures, and consumer habits. While it takes enormous time and effort, the result has been more than satisfactory as the company is now the top one or two player in most of its operating regions.





Suppose MercadoLibre can continue to execute at this level. In that case, there is a good chance that the company can continue to deliver above-average growth rates for the foreseeable future as it rides the on

Time Published: 20240919T091400
Summary: E-commerce could be a huge opportunity for Costco Wholesale in the years ahead.
Content: A top retail stock to own this year has undoubtedly been Costco Wholesale (COST 0.69%). Its shares are up more than 35% since January as it has been hitting new all-time highs along the way. Not only is it a stable investment given its extremely popular warehouses, but the company has also continually found ways to grow its business.
You might think that with the stock now trading at more than 50 times earnings and the economy potentially heading for a slowdown, shares of Costco Wholesale may be approaching a peak, finally. But there's reason to remain bullish on the stock not just this year but for the long haul, as one area of its business has been booming for a while.

E-commerce sales are a huge opportunity for Costco
When you think of buying something online, odds are you're going to go to either Amazon or Walmart. But Costco has the potential to be a big player in that arena as well. The company doesn't separate its e-commerce sales when reporting quarterly numbers, but it does highlight the growth rate.
And on a monthly basis, the company has consistently been growing online sales by double digits. Below is a table of Costco's comparable sales growth rates this year, by month, looking at both the total company sales and just e-commerce.

In every single month thus far this year, Costco's online business has generated comparable year-over-year revenue growth of around 15% or better.

Time Published: 20240919T082002
Summary: Amazon stock dropped after its second-quarter report.
Content: Amazon (AMZN 0.91%) stock has gained a staggering 190,400% over its lifetime. If you would have invested $1,000 when it first went public, you'd have more than $1.9 million today.
That was close to 30 years ago. Could it be that investing in Amazon today is a once-in-a-generation opportunity? Let's see why it could be.
Winners keep on winning
Investors looking for the next big thing can sometimes miss the outstanding opportunity right in front of their eyes. Many a shareholder has regretted selling too soon because a stock had already become a multi-bagger.
Amazon may have already delivered life-changing gains, but it could continue to be a stellar stock to own for the foreseeable future. I qualify that by saying that it would be nearly impossible for it to repeat the same gains it's made until now, but it still has incredible prospects to be a market-beating stock long term.
It's a master of developing new businesses, which is why it's such a sure bet for growth. In the past, it was e-commerce, and then cloud computing. It has become the dominant company by far in both of these areas, with a lead so wide, especially in e-commerce, that it would be difficult to unseat in the near future. Total sales increased 10% year over year in the second quarter, and Amazon Web Services (AWS), the cloud-computing segment, accelerated to a 19% sales increase. There are plenty of tailwinds for both businesses as well.






Amazon has several smaller businesses that are growing fast, specifically advertising, and today the tailwinds are coming from the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. CEO Andy Jassy said, "I don't know if any of us have seen a possibility like this in technology in a really long time, for sure, since the cloud, perhaps since the Internet." Although it's still in its infancy, the generative AI business already has a multi-billion-dollar revenue run rate.
Management sees its advantage in its flexibility. Its feedback suggests that customers are looking for o

Title: Intel's Foundry Finally Has Some Good News. Has the Chipmaker Learned Its Lesson?
URL: https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/09/18/intel-foundry-good-news-stock-chipmaker/
Time Published: 20240918T170421
Summary: The stock is moving higher, but can the momentum last?
Content: Intel's (INTC 3.31%) stock price collapse at the start of August on news out of its earnings report wasn't a big surprise. The chipmaker had fallen behind after years of operating a money-losing foundry business, while fabless rivals, like Advanced Micro Devices, have gained market share.
Intel has long dominated the PC processor business, but a cultural aversion to risk-taking prevented the company from extending that leading position into other areas. It missed the mobile transition and now seems to be falling behind in artificial intelligence (AI).
The company even lost Apple as a customer for its Macs after Apple experienced several years of frustration with Intel's chip quality and the pace of its development. Apple also saw an opportunity to improve its battery life and switched to using Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) as its manufacturing partner because TSMC could make smaller chips.
Intel also passed up potentially game-changing opportunities, including a chance to invest in OpenAI back in 2017. Intel was in talks to take a 15% stake in the company for $1 billion. But then-CEO Bob Swan said he was skeptical that generative AI models would make it to market soon enough to repay Intel's investment and didn't close the deal. It was just the kind of short-sightedness and poor judgment that has plagued the company these past few years.
Similarly, SoftBank, the Japanese mega-investor that's funded everything from Uber Technologies to Arm Holdings, held talks with Intel about making an AI chip that would compete with Nvidia. Those talks broke down after Intel couldn't meet Softbank's requirements. That, again, is evidence of a familiar pattern of Intel's products not meeting standards.





The Intel bulls have been a bit desperate for some good news to counter all the negativity for some time now. They recently got some in the form of two new announcements about Intel's foundry division. The news sparked a 9.2% jump in the stock price over two days (Sep

Time Published: 20240918T133000
Summary: The energy drink company's stock has fallen precipitously lately.
Content: It can be difficult to think dispassionately about your stock investments. After all, it's your hard-earned money at stake.
But investors need to take a step back and analyze a company's fundamental prospects when they are considering buying or selling its shares. This approach can help you avoid getting swayed by considerations such as the news reports or short-term stock price swings.
Investors could certainly benefit by taking that approach with Celsius Holdings (CELH -2.64%). Earlier this year, its stock price approached an all-time high of nearly $100. Since then, the shares have fallen by about 64%.
Does this represent a warning signal or a buying opportunity?

Image source: Getty Images.

Fast but slowing top-line growth
Celsius, founded in 2004, makes and sells energy drinks. The company markets its highly caffeinated products as fitness drinks, featuring ingredients such as green tea and ginger, and minimizing artificial ingredients. 





Customers have been receptive, and sales have grown quickly. The company inked a domestic distribution agreement with PepsiCo in 2022 that they expanded to Canada late last year.
Celsius brought in $1.6 million in revenue in 2007; by last year, its top line had grown to $1.3 billion with earnings of $0.79 per diluted share. And from 2022 to 2023, with the help of the PepsiCo deal, the top line doubled. 
Opportunities and challenges
While its growth has slowed in 2024, second-quarter revenue still increased a healthy 23% year over year to $402 million, and earnings increased 65% to $0.28 per diluted share. Celsius' share of the energy drink market had expanded by 1.4 percentage points to 11% as of mid-July. 
Management has also been working on expanding the brand's footprint internationally, and early results have been promising. International sales grew 30% in the latest quarter as it began sales in Canada, the United Kingdom, and Ireland. Management expects to launch the brand in Australia, New Zealand, and France this y

Title: Where Will Nvidia Stock Be in 1 Year?

Time Published: 20240918T111500
Summary: There are a lot of factors that could influence Nvidia stock over the next year.
Content: It's no secret that excitement surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) has helped propel technology stocks, and the entire market, to new highs over the last year. It's also no secret that semiconductor stock Nvidia (NVDA -1.59%) has witnessed unparalleled buying activity -- so much so, that it's now the third most valuable company in the world as measured by market cap.
But with shares soaring 140% so far in 2024 and 160% over the last 12 months, could Nvidia stock possibly be headed even higher?
Below, I'll explore some factors that could support the ideas of Nvidia stock moving both higher or lower over the next year. Let's dig into the full picture and assess what could influence Nvidia's price action. I'll make my final case for where I see Nvidia stock landing one year from now.

Nvidia stock could be headed higher, but...
Over the last couple of years, one of the biggest catalysts for semiconductor companies is demand for graphics processing units (GPUs). GPUs are an integral component for training large language models (LLMs) and myriad machine learning applications.
As it stands today, Nvidia is widely perceived as developing the best GPUs on the market. Its hardware roster featuring H100 and A100 chips is used by some of the largest companies in the world. Furthermore, Nvidia's next-generation GPUs, the Blackwell series, are finally set to hit the market following a brief setback due to a design flaw.





During Nvidia's second-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings call, CFO Colette Kress said, "Demand for Blackwell platforms is well above supply, and we expect this to continue into next year."
Kress said that Blackwell should generate "several billion dollars" of revenue during the fourth quarter. Considering the robust demand levels for Blackwell, I think it's reasonable to think that the bulk of these revenue tailwinds will trickle into fiscal 2026 (calendar year 2025).
As a result, I would not be surprised at all to see Nvidia stock experience some revived bu

Title: These 2 Dow Stocks Are Set to Soar in 2024 and Beyond

Time Published: 20240918T100500
Summary: These top stocks have plenty of growth catalysts.
Content: The Dow Jones Industrial Average tracks the performance of 30 blue chip stocks. The index has returned 10% year to date, but companies making big splashes in artificial intelligence (AI) could fare much better over the next year and beyond.
Here are two Dow stocks to buy right now.
1. Amazon
Amazon (AMZN 0.91%) stock has delivered wealth-building returns for shareholders over the last few decades, and it's currently up 22% in 2024. Amazon still has plenty of growth opportunities in retail and enterprise cloud services to fuel the stock higher.

Amazon's expanding same-day delivery and growing selection of items will be important advantages in capturing a growing share of the global e-commerce market. Data and intelligence platform Statista predicts that online retail spending will surpass $8 trillion by 2027.
What makes the stock particularly attractive right now is the company's improving profit margin. Operating income nearly doubled in the second quarter over the year-ago quarter, and there are still several opportunities to improve retail margins further, including decreasing transportation costs by getting closer to customers with more same-day delivery facilities.





Meanwhile, Amazon's cloud service business, which generates two-thirds of the company's operating income, is showing even greater growth potential. Companies are migrating their data from on-premises servers to Amazon Web Services to take advantage of tools like Amazon Bedrock, which helps companies build their own AI applications. Amazon also offers custom AI chips that offer better price performance than higher-priced chips from top hardware supplier Nvidia. These are a few of the reasons why AWS' revenue growth accelerated in Q2 to 19% over the year-ago quarter.
The opportunities in online commerce and cloud services are great reasons to consider buying Amazon shares in 2024. Analysts expect Amazon's earnings to grow at double-digit rates in the coming years, and that points to more new highs

Summary: Visa stock is rallying in lockstep with the broader payment processing industry.
Content: After selling off this past summer, Dow Jones Industrial Average component Visa (V -0.17%) has rallied almost 10% during the past month. Here's why the financial stock just reached a new all-time high and has the potential to keep going.
A numbers game
Visa generates revenue every time one of its debit or credit cards is swiped, tapped, or processed on mobile, desktop, or in person. The company's fee structure allows it to benefit from both the frequency and volume of transactions. The company also has a growing international business, which has allowed travelers to process transactions securely and avoid manually converting currencies. 

Image source: Getty Images.

Visa's price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) is almost 31, which is lower than its median P/E during the past three, five, seven, and 10 years.

V PE Ratio data by YCharts.
Add it all up, and Visa is a great value, even after its recent run-up.





Visa is a "safe" stock
Unlike other growth stocks that are priced for perfection, Visa's earning can continue growing at a high-single-digit to low-double-digit percentage pace, thanks to the benefits of network effects and its growing global reach. It doesn't depend heavily on economic cycles or strength in a particular end market or industry.
This is a particularly compelling advantage, compared to cyclical sectors. For example, if artificial intelligence (AI) spending slows, it could cause a major downturn across the semiconductor industry. If economic growth slows, cyclical industrial or consumer discretionary companies can get hit hard. If oil prices take a hit, oil and gas companies may see slowing or even negative profits.
Granted, some companies are much better positioned to handle cyclical slowdowns, even in vulnerable industries. But Visa is in a different category. It has proven that its earnings can steadily grow even amid inflation, higher interest rates, or recession fears.
Perhaps most impressive is the stock's relative lack of volatility. During the

Summary: Wall Street's smartest and richest money managers are casting aside shares of Nvidia in favor of two other members of the "Magnificent Seven." ...
Content: Investors are rarely at a loss for important data releases on Wall Street. Monthly economic reports highlighting jobs data and the prevailing rate of inflation, coupled with roughly six weeks crammed full of earnings reports from thousands of publicly traded companies, have the potential to overwhelm investors and allow key announcements to slide under the radar.
In mid-August, one of these important announcements may have gone unnoticed.
On Aug. 14, institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management filed Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A 13F provides a concise, under-the-hood look at what Wall Street's smartest money managers purchased and sold in the latest quarter (in this instance, the June-ended quarter). In other words, 13Fs clue investors into which stocks, industries, sectors, and trends have been piquing the interest of Wall Street's top asset managers.

The second quarter was a particularly active period for billionaire money managers. Although artificial intelligence (AI) has been making waves on Wall Street, billionaire investors were clear sellers of AI darling Nvidia (NVDA -1.59%), and big-time buyers of two other trillion-dollar stocks.
Billionaire money managers gave Nvidia the boot for a third consecutive quarter
Selling shares of Nvidia is nothing new for Wall Street's brightest and richest investors. The latest quarter marked the third straight quarter that more than a half-dozen prominent billionaire investors had reduced their stakes in Wall Street's leading AI stock.

Time Published: 20240917T170815
Summary: Intel scored a new deal with Amazon.
Content: After hanging on the ropes for much of August and September, Intel (INTC 3.31%) is suddenly having a banner week.
The stock jumped yesterday after the company secured $3 billion in funding from the CHIPS Act, and today it's climbing again after it announced a new partnership with Amazon (AMZN 0.91%). 
At 12:23 p.m. ET, the stock was up 4.4% on the news. Investors see it as a sign that the company is reinventing itself after announcing a massive restructuring in its second-quarter earnings report.

What's happening with Intel and Amazon
After the market closed yesterday, Intel said it was expanding its strategic collaboration with Amazon Web Services, announcing a multiyear, multibillion-dollar partnership for Intel to produce custom chips for Amazon, including an artificial intelligence (AI) fabric chip and a Xeon 6 chip designed to handle computing-intensive AI workloads. 
The news gives Intel's foundry business a much-needed win. It's been losing billions of dollars a year and has fallen behind rivals like Taiwan Semiconductor.





The AI fabric chip will use Intel's 18A process, which makes nodes as small as 18 angstroms (1.8 nanometers).

What it means for Intel
Coming directly on the heels of the CHIPS news, the expanded partnership with Amazon is another significant win for Intel Foundry.
However, investors shouldn't get carried with Intel's rally. The company still needs to execute and do so in a timely, cost-efficient manner, which has been a problem for it in the past.
Intel certainly isn't going away, and a vast ecosystem depends on and supports its chip design and foundry businesses, but a turnaround will take a lot more than back-to-back favorable announcements.





Keep your eye on its next earnings report, due out around the end of October. While the numbers will likely be ugly, the company could give some insights into the progress it's making in revamping the business.

URL: https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/09/17/1-wall-street-analyst-thinks-shopify-is-going-to-9/
Time Published: 20240917T162223
Summary: Another bull lines up behind Shopify.
Content: Shopify (SHOP 0.05%) has long put up enviable growth numbers, but its valuation has historically made the stock volatile.
The e-commerce software leader continues to trade at a high valuation, acting like a battleground stock at times as investors speculate on how long its rapid growth will continue, especially after its plan to expand into logistics through the Deliverr acquisition backfired.
However, Shopify impressed investors with its latest earnings report in August, and now another Wall Street analyst is lining up behind the stock.

Image source: Getty Images.

Shopify's going to $99?
Redburn Atlantic upgraded Shopify stock on Tuesday morning from neutral to buy. 
The firm noted the company's leading integrations across social media and other platforms where businesses advertise and consumers shop, in addition to the increasing functionality of the Shop Pay button.





It expects the company to continue to grow as it capitalizes on Gen Z's online spending. It gave the stock a price target of $99, implying 33% upside.

Is Shopify a buy at $74?
Shopify is the clear leader in e-commerce software, having defended itself against the likes of BigCommerce, Amazon, and Square (which has since rebranded as Block), and it continues to find new ways to grow even as its gross merchandise volume makes it one of the biggest retail platforms in the world.
Shopify reported 21% revenue growth in the second quarter, and its free cash flow margin more than doubled to 16%. 
The company is now profitable according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), but on an adjusted basis, it still trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 76. 





Shopify's competitive advantage gives the stock long-term upside, but getting to $99 in the next year seems like a tall order even as the business is executing. Shopify still looks like a buy, but the current valuation should temper expectations.

Title: PDD Holdings Stock Is Beaten Down Now, but It Could 10x

Time Published: 20240917T133000
Summary: The Chinese e-commerce leader's pullback could be a great buying opportunity.
Content: PDD's (PDD -0.08%) stock closed at a record high of $202.82 on Feb. 17, 2021. That represented a 10-bagger gain from its IPO price of $19 on July 26, 2018. The bulls were impressed by the Chinese e-commerce leader's explosive growth rates, and the temporary buying frenzy in hyper-growth stocks amplified its gains.
But today, PDD trades at about $95. It shed over half of its value as its growth cooled and rising rates compressed its valuations. Escalating tensions between the U.S. and China also drove many U.S. investors away from Chinese stocks. However, I believe PDD still has a shot at delivering another 10-bagger gain over the next decade.

How PDD differs from Alibaba and JD
PDD was founded only nine years ago, but it quickly expanded and became China's third-largest e-commerce company after Alibaba (BABA -0.23%) and JD.com (JD -0.66%). PDD's initial growth spurt was driven by China's lower-income shoppers in its lower-tier cities. It generally sold cheaper products than Alibaba and JD, and it encouraged its shoppers to team up across social media networks to score big bulk discounts.
PDD subsequently launched a farm-to-table platform that allowed China's farmers to directly sell their fresh produce to consumers at lower prices. That strategy disrupted traditional grocers and turned PDD into China's largest online agricultural platform. Alibaba and JD only operate traditional brick-and-mortar supermarkets.

In 2022, PDD expanded overseas with Temu, a cross-border marketplace that connected its Chinese merchants with overseas buyers. It's now one of the world's most popular e-commerce apps with more than 167 million monthly active users (MAUs) worldwide, and 50 million of its MAUs are in the United States. Alibaba operates a similar cross-border marketplace called AliExpress, but JD's cross-border marketplace only connects overseas sellers to Chinese buyers.





PDD initially sold its products through first-party and third-party chan

Title: 2 Top Tech Stocks That Could Make You a Millionaire

Time Published: 20240917T094600
Summary: Both of these players are leaders in their fields.
Content: Can you become a millionaire by investing in stocks? Absolutely. But there are a couple of key rules to follow. It's important to diversify your investments across a broad range of solid companies, and it's key to invest for the long term. You'll have a much better chance of reaching your goal if you hold on to quality stocks for a period of 10 years or longer than if you bail out after a few weeks or months.
Of course, it's possible that even by following these guidelines you won't pocket millions -- but there's a very strong likelihood you'll still find yourself in a fantastic financial position down the road if you choose wisely now and stick with investing for the long haul.
Today, a great way to offer your portfolio a boost or get started with a bang if you're new to investing is to buy a couple of leading technology stocks that are likely to continue their leadership well into the future. I'm thinking of two with terrific earnings and share performance track records, and plenty of potential ahead. These two players won't do the job alone -- but it's unlikely that any one stock will make you a millionaire unless you invest a tremendous amount in just that player. And that's much too risky. These top tech stocks could help make you a millionaire, though. Let's find out more.

1. Amazon
Amazon (AMZN 0.91%) is one of my favorite tech stocks because of its diversification and leadership in two high-growth areas. The company dominates in both e-commerce and cloud computing. On top of this, Amazon also is on the road to becoming one of the biggest winners in the hot growth area of artificial intelligence (AI).
In e-commerce, Amazon's Prime subscription program and focus on keeping prices low and delivery fast should help it stay ahead. Annual sales events such as Prime Day help the company bring in new members -- and the member retention rate is high. Over the first three months of 2023, 99% of Prime members renewed their memberships for

Time Published: 20240917T070600
Summary: Third Point is heavily invested in Amazon, Microsoft, and Taiwan Semiconductor.
Content: Dan Loeb is the founder and CEO of Third Point, an institutional asset manager whose flagship Offshore Fund has returned 13.1% annually since its inception in 1996. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 (^GSPC -0.19%) has returned 9.4% annually during the same period.
Loeb is "one of the most successful hedge fund managers of his generation," according to The Wall Street Journal. And while Third Point underperformed in 2022 and 2023, its long-term outperformance makes Loeb a good case study for investors.
Loeb has compared artificial intelligence (AI) to disruptive technologies like the internet and smartphones, and AI a prevalent theme in his investments. Somewhat surprisingly, Third Point does not have a position in Nvidia, but it did have 23.1% of $8.7 billion portfolio invested in three AI stocks as of June:

Amazon (AMZN 0.91%): 11%
Microsoft (MSFT -0.78%): 8.1%
Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM -1.21%): 4%.

Here's what investors should know.

Amazon: 11% of Dan Loeb's portfolio
Amazon operates the largest e-commerce marketplace in North America and Western Europe. The company has used the scope of its retail business to secure a strong presence in digital advertising. But its greatest opportunity to make money on artificial intelligence (AI) lies in its cloud computing business, Amazon Web Services (AWS).





AWS is the leader in cloud infrastructure and platform services, and its market share increased one percentage point between the first and second quarters of 2024. That scale means AWS is uniquely positioned to benefit from AI simply because it already has such a large customer base, and they are more likely to lean on AWS for AI services when/if the need arises as opposed to working with a new cloud provider.
AWS has also extended its ability to monetize AI with new products like coding assistant Amazon Q and generative AI development platform Amazon Bedrock. CEO Andy Jassy recently told analysts, "Our AI business continues to grow dramatically with a multibillion-dollar rev
