If you're making your list of stocks to watch in the new year, UBS has a list of its highest conviction stocks for 2026 that could offer some insight. The bank released its list of top picks for the coming year this week, encompassing names across various sectors and themes that analysts believe will outperform the broader market. After another year of strong stock-market growth, some finance pros are looking to areas outside big tech to fuel more gains. With the AI trade looking shakier than it once did, investors are on the hunt for alternatives that can help keep the bull market going. "We've focused on stocks where we believe our analysts have a differentiated view vs. consensus, and where we have interesting or proprietary data sources," UBS said. "We have also considered potential upside to price target and risk/reward skew as well as a stock's exposure to key themes during the selection process." Here are 10 of the bank's highest conviction calls for the coming year. Ticker: ACAD 2025 return: +46% Commentary: Biotech firm Acadia Pharmaceuticals is UBS analyst Ashwani Verma's top pick for the healthcare sector. He thinks the company's management is executing on growth initiatives for multiple promising new drugs. "We believe an upside could come from successful outcome from ACP-204's Alzheimer's disease psychosis (ADP) trial," he said. "Read-out is expected in mid-'26." Ticker: LNT 2025 return: +11% Commentary: Analyst William Appicelli names power generation company Alliant Energy as his top pick in the utilities sector. He thinks the market is undervaluing the company as it is likely to benefit from the ongoing data center boom in 2026, a view shared by other Wall Street banks. "Current valuation does not fully capture the 2-4GW of upside opportunities. We expect announcement for service agreements for this load to be incorporated into the capital plans over the next 12 months," he said. Ticker: AMZN 2025 return: +0.3% Commentary: Amazon is the only Magnificent Seven stock on UBS' list of top picks for 2026. While it's been outperformed by peers in 2025, analyst Stephen Ju sees it benefiting from the ongoing AI boom as well as progress in both sports licensing and same-day delivery in its e-commerce business. Ticker: AMT 2025 return: -3% Commentary: While American Tower operates as a real estate investment trust (REIT), its niche position developing and leasing communications infrastructure, such as cellular towers and data centers, makes it attractive. UBS analyst Batya Levi lists it as the top pick for the Communications Services sector, citing rising 5G deployments and compounding mobile data usage, both of which can set it up for growth in 2025. Ticker: COF 2025 return: +33% Commentary: Capital One is UBS analyst Erika Najarian's top pick for the financial sector. Capital One stock has enjoyed a strong year already, but Najarian maintains it is likely to keep rising. "In the case of COF, we see an opportunity for investors to own a vertically integrated payments platform and card juggernaut where COF leverages DFS's credit and debit networks to earn revenue without taking balance sheet or credit risk and lowers its natural cost of funding — driving synergies well beyond typical bank mergers," she said. Ticker: PEP 2025 return: -2% Commentary: PepsiCo stock has struggled this year, but the company beat out its rival Coca-Cola for the position of top-ranked consumer staples stock on the bank's list. Analyst Peter Grom highlighted its high growth potential relative to many of its peers. "We believe PEP is a buy as the company is one of the only large-cap names in our coverage to be on track to deliver +LSD/+MSD top-line growth and +MSD/+HSD EPS growth, all while trading at a significant relative discount to US large-cap multinational peers (~17.6x vs. ~21.7x 5-yr average)," Grom said. Ticker: DECK 2025 return: -50% Commentary: The outdoor shoes and equipment producer has spent most of the year trending downward, but UBS thinks a turnaround is coming. The bank's analysts see Deckers stock as an opportunity for investors to gain exposure to a strong company before it rebounds. "We see a very good opportunity to buy shares in a growth company significantly undervalued by the market. We expect DECK's EPS to positively surprise over the NTM due to Hoka and UGG performing better than expected," said UBS' Jay Sole. The analyst named it as the top pick in the consumer discretionary sector. Ticker: GM 2025 return: +52% Commentary: The carmaker is UBS' top pick for the automotive industry after a strong trading year. The bank lists it under the broader industrial sector. Analyst Joseph Spark isn't overly concerned with the struggling EV industry, noting that he sees potential for General Motors to improve its production costs and restructure in a way that minimizes its EV exposure. Spark also believes that GM can benefit from the current economic policy landscape if interest rates continue to decline. Ticker: OVV 2025 return: -6% Commentary: Ovintiv is an oil and natural gas producer that serves the US and Canada. While the stock has struggled in 2025, analyst Josh Silverstein still rates it as his top pick for the energy sector, noting that recent deals are likely to help the company turn around in 2026. "The transactions add Montney resource depth, streamlines capital allocation, and most importantly, improves OVV's balance sheet and return of capital profile," he wrote. "We see OVV's current multiple reflecting concerns over its balance sheet and Midland inventory depth." Ticker: WWD 2025 return: +71% Commentary: Woodward may not be as well known as its peers in the defense industry, but its year-to-date growth makes it a standout in the sector. "We see faster revenue growth and better margin expansion than the market expects, with a decade plus of visibility into aftermarket streams on the LEAP/GTF engines," he noted. Parsons also highlighted the industrial industry's strong power generation tailwinds, noting that fast-growing customers are causing a surge in demand that will likely help boost Woodward stock in the coming year.

Title: Amazon Set to Waste $10 Billion on OpenAI
URL: https://247wallst.com/technology-3/2025/12/17/amazon-set-to-waste-10-billion-on-openai/
Time Published: 2025-12-17T15:15:41Z

Technology Sending You to Google News in 3 © megaflopp / Shutterstock.com Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) apparently cannot help itself. Media reports say it plans to invest $10 billion into OpenAI. OpenAI, which until recently has been the leading artificial intelligence (AI) company in the world, has raised money from a long list of investors. Some are venture capitalists who are simply writing checks to get returns. However, another list consists of money or strategic deals with Microsoft, Oracle, Softbank, Nvidia, and, soon, Disney. What these tech investors are getting is a stake in a company that has had its spot at the top of the industry challenged by Gemini 3. That is an Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) offering. It is also one that the company says will not make money until 2030, one that will need hundreds of billions of dollars to hit its ambiguous goals, and one that has a growing number of direct competitors. These competitors include divisions of public companies, well-funded xAI and Anthropic, and a legion of smaller companies. Bloomberg reports, “OpenAI is in initial discussions to raise at least $10 billion from Amazon.com Inc. and use its chips, a potential win for the online retailer’s effort to broaden its AI industry presence and compete with Nvidia Corp.” Amazon is a tiny player in the AI chip business. Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) dominates, with a market cap of $4.33 trillion, which makes it the most valuable company in the world. Put plainly, the Amazon deal is part of the dangerous “round tripping” that goes on in the industry. One company invests in another. The company that gets the investment uses the money to buy products or services from the investor. Amazon clearly has little chance of competing head-to-head with Nvidia, so it is buying its way into the market. And Amazon can hardly say it is getting special treatment from OpenAI. The Financial Times reports, “OpenAI has already locked in $1.5tn in long-term deals with Nvidia, Oracle, AMD and Broadcom to supply chips and other computing infrastructure.” OpenAI does have one important strategic advantage in an Amazon deal. Like the rest of the AI world, it does not want to be trapped in a world where Nvidia is the only arms supplier. People have begun to ask whether the AI industry has created a valuation bubble. They are worried that the companies leading the race into AI will never make money. Many AI products are currently free. Investors worry that the data centers needed to run AI will take years to build and may not have enough electricity to run them. Still others believe that not all the large AI companies can survive in a brutally competitive market. The total of these investments will eventually move into the trillions of dollars. The Amazon deal with OpenAI is another example that the train has run off the rails.

Title: Premarket Movers: Amazon is Gaining Momentum

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © LALAKA / Shutterstock.com Shares of Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) are up about $3.55 in premarket. All on news OpenAI is in talks with the e-commerce giant about an investment that could exceed $10 billion. It could also include an agreement to use Amazon AI chips, too. This comes not long after OpenAI outlined the details of its relationship with Microsoft. According to CNBC, that relationship will also allow it to raise capital and partner with other AI companies. In addition, Amazon ran higher on news that it will invest $35 billion across India through 2030. By 2030, the investment is expected to quadruple exports to $80 billion. Technically, shares of Amazon just found support at $222.56, with overextensions on RSI, MACD, and Williams’ %R. From its last traded price of $222.56, we’d like to see the stock initially break through its 50-day moving average at around $229.25 a share. Helping, Oppenheimer raised its price target for AMZN from $290 to $305, noting that Amazon Web Services (AWS) could double its capacity through 2027, and serve as a key stock catalyst. Severely oversold shares of Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) are showing big signs of life, too. At the moment, it’s up about $2.35 a share in premarket. After gapping lower on AI data center spending fears, the tech giant appears to have caught strong support at $188.65. It’s also overextended on RSI, MACD, and Williams’ %R. From here, we’d like to see ORCL initially refill its bearish gap at around $220 a share. Longer-term, we’d like to see ORCL retest $260 a share. Fueling upside, Mizuho analysts say ORCL is among its top enterprise stocks for 2026. The firm says 2025 was a “transformative” year for the company, as it went from “an emerging cloud vendor into a key AI infrastructure player,” as quoted by Seeking Alpha. “We see Oracle as a [long-term] AI beneficiary given its end-to-end stack, including apps, its industry-leading database for mission-critical workloads, and OCI for AI training and inference,” they added. The firm also has an outperform rating on the stock with a price target of $400. Shares of Micron (NASDAQ: MU) are up about $4.40 a share in premarket. The company, which is expected to post earnings after the bell tonight, also received a buy rating from analysts at Needham. In fact, Needham analysts just reiterated a buy on MU with a price target of $300 a share. Meanwhile, Wells Fargo believes MU will benefit from the dynamic random-access market (DRAM), which is expected to grow by about 100%. Fueling upside, TrendForce just increased its 2025 and 2026 DRAM industry estimates, according to Wells Fargo. They now expect to see 2025 DRAM revenues of $165.7 billion, or 73% year-over-year growth. They also expect to see 2026 DRAM revenues of $333.5 billion, or 101% year-over-year growth. Technically, MU is challenging its 50-day moving average, which has served as support for the stock since September. From its last traded price of $232.51, we’d like to see MU retest its prior high of about $265 a share. Our top personal finance-related articles today. Your wallet will thank you later.
