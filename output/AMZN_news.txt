Elon Musk was already the richest person on the planet. Now, thanks to Tesla, xAI, and SpaceX’s surging valuations, he’s worth more than $400 billion, according to Bloomberg News’s calculations. Specifically, he’s worth $439.2 billion. For reference, the next richest men alive are Amazon (AMZN-0.85%) founder and Blue Origin owner Jeff Bezos, Meta (META-1.92%) CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and Oracle (ORCL-1.84%) Chief Technology Officer Larry Ellison, according to the Bloomberg Billionaire Index. They’re worth, respectively, $244 billion, $219 billion, and $197 billion. Musk is also at least as wealthy as Mansa Musa, the emperor of the West African Mali Empire and previous record holder of richest man to ever live, who historians estimate was worth around $400 billion, according to the BBC. The impetus for Musk’s latest surge in wealth is SpaceX’s newfound value of $350 billion, which makes it the most valuable startup in the world. On Wednesday, SpaceX and its investors agreed to buy $1.25 billion of shares from employees and company insiders. “What’s really crazy about this is that almost no investors wanted to sell shares even at a $350B valuation! SpaceX reduced the amount of shares it bought back from employees in order to allow some new investors in,” Musk wrote on his X Wednesday. Besides SpaceX, Musk is the CEO of Tesla and owner of X. Corp. His other companies include artificial intelligence startup xAI, brain chip firm Neuralink, and tunneling firm The Boring Company. xAI, recently raised $6 billion at a $50 billion valuation less than two years after he founded it. That’s also more than double its valuation in May, when it was valued at $24 billion at a value of $6 billion from backers like Andreessen Horowitz and Saudi Arabian investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal. Musk owns more than 13% of Tesla shares, which have surged since President-elect Donald Trump won the presidential election in November. The stock climbed to a new record of $415 per share on Wednesday, narrowly surpassing its prior record for intraday trading of $414.50 per share on Nov. 4, 2021. In recent weeks, investors have been excited by Trump’s potential actions that could aid the automaker, including streamlining autonomous vehicle regulations and ending the $7,500 consumer tax credits for electric vehicles. Musk has said that ending those credits will hurt Tesla’s rivals more than it damages his company, although analysts expect some downside in the short term. Several analysts have also raised their price targets for the stock in recent days as they look to catch up with the stock surge, often pointing to Tesla’s plans for driverless vehicles and humanoid robots.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks rallied on Wednesday, led by Big Tech, as investors digested another month of sticky inflation data that met economists' expectations and likely pointed to a Federal Reserve interest rate cut next week. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped about 1.7% amid a feverish rally in the "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks. Google parent Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) shares extended gains to hit a record high, up as much as 4.6%. Meanwhile Tesla (TSLA), Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL) all also surged to record highs. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose around 0.8%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) hugged the after initially opening the day higher. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices soared to trade above $100,600 a token in afternoon trade. Fresh inflation data out on Wednesday showed consumer prices rose as forecast in November, keeping the Federal Reserve on track to lower interest rates again in December. The latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased 2.7% over the prior year in November, a slight uptick from October's 2.6% annual gain in prices. The yearly increase matched economist expectations. On a "core" basis, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, prices in November climbed 0.3% over the prior month, matching October, and posted an annual rate of 3.3% for the fourth consecutive month. Earlier on Wednesday, a report that China is considering devaluing its currency sent ripples through global stock markets and boosted the dollar (DX=F). The potential move is seen as a response to higher tariffs promised by President-elect Donald Trump, as a weaker yuan (CNHUSD=X) could make Chinese exports cheaper. On the corporate front, Macy's (M) stock somewhat recovered from double-digit losses earlier in the session after the department store chain lowered its full-year profit guidance. The retailer released its third-quarter results after delaying the report while it investigated an employee hiding up to $154 million in expenses. The "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks are roaring in Wednesday's post inflation print rally. Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) are all up more than 1% while Apple (AAPL) stock is also in the green. At some point in the session, Alphabet, Tesla, Meta, Amazon and Apple all touched intraday record highs. Meanwhile, Roundhill's Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS), which tracks all seven stocks, is also at a record high. Up more nearly 3% on Wednesday, the group was far outpacing the 0.9% gain in the S&P 500 (^GSPC). This is a continuation from the trend seen since the start of December. In the past month, the Magnificent Seven ETF is up nearly 9% while the S&P 500 is up just more than 1%. Here are some of the top trending tickers on the Yahoo Finance homepage... Macy's (M): Macy's stock fell around 5% on Wednesday, somewhat recovering from earlier double-digit losses. The company reported its official third quarter results upon the conclusion of an internal investigation into an employee hiding up to $151 million of expenses that led to a delay in reporting. As Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma reports, the tepid earnings report was broadly in line with the preliminary results shared last month. Macy's reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.04, which beat Wall Street's expectation of $0.03. Net sales declined 2.4% from a year ago to $4.74 billion, versus $4.75 billion expected. Same-store sales declined 1.3%, compared to estimates of 1.39%. The company lowered its full-year profit guidance as it closes stores in a turnaround push. It now expects adjusted profit per share of $2.25 to $2.50, versus its prior forecast of $2.34 to $2.69. Super Micro Computer (SMCI): The stock extended declines, falling over 8% despite comments from CEO Charles Liang, who said Tuesday that he does not believe the company will be delisted from the Nasdaq. As Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton has reported, shares have been on a wild ride in recent months as the company continues to grapple with the the fallout from an August report by short seller firm Hindenburg Research. The report pointed to alleged accounting malpractices, violations of export controls, and shady relationships between top executives and Super Micro partners. Shares had started the week under pressure after JPMorgan (JPM) analyst Samik Chatterjee on Monday maintained an Underweight rating on the stock. Shares are down about 50% over the past six months. Housing prices have remained stubbornly high, proving to be a sticky category for inflation. But the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) out Wednesday showed the pace of housing cost increases has begun to ease. Yahoo Finance's Dani Romero reports: Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed shelter costs, the largest component of CPI, rose 0.3% compared to the previous month in November. This was lower than October’s 0.4% increase. On an annual basis, shelter costs rose 4.7% in November, down from October’s year-over-year gain of 4.9% and the smallest 12-month increase since early 2022. Still, the shelter component accounted for 40% of November’s overall monthly CPI increase. "Finally, the slow grind lower in shelter inflation continued to play out last month, which is an encouraging development," Jeff Schulze, head of economic and market strategy at ClearBridge Investments, wrote in a note to clients after the release. Economists have long expected a slowdown in rent increases, a trend that has been reflected in other data, but the broad cooldown in rents has not appeared in the CPI report. This discrepancy can be partly attributed to the BLS collecting rent data every six months, leading to a lag in reporting. The government said the index for rent rose 0.2% in November, the lowest since July 2021. Read more here. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices rocketed higher on Wednesday to cross the critical $100,00 mark again after November's CPI report met expectations. In mid-morning trade, the largest cryptocurrency rose 5% to trade at around $100,700 a token. Other smaller cryptocurrencies and crypto-adjacent names mimicked bitcoin's moves to the upside. Ethereum (ETH-USD) rose nearly 7% to trade around $3,800 a coin. Meanwhile, shares of MicroStrategy (MSTR), which owns nearly 280,000 bitcoins, climbed around 6%. The company recently announced the purchase of an additional 51,780 bitcoins for $4.6 billion. MicroStrategy's bitcoin holdings are now worth $16.5 billion. Coinbase (COIN), which allows crypto trading on its platform, also saw shares rise roughly 6%. Bitcoin took a breather on Tuesday after prices enjoyed a record-setting rally on the heels of Donald Trump's presidential win. His coming administration is viewed as generally more friendly to the alternative asset class. In July, Trump attended a bitcoin conference in Nashville and has since pledged to usher in more supportive regulation. His promises also included appointing a crypto Presidential Advisory Council and replacing current SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who has since announced he will step down on Jan. 20. Consumer price increases met expectations in November — but overall, inflation still remains hot. The sticky nature of the print "is a little disconcerting," Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, wrote on Wednesday. "But we don’t expect it to persuade the Fed to skip another 25bp rate cut at next week’s FOMC meeting." Immediately following the report, markets continued to price in another 25 basis point cut at the central bank's meeting next week, with the odds of a cut rising to 98.1% from about an 89% chance one day prior. "As markets came into today’s figure with fears of an upside surprise, the in-line number is being received very positively," wrote Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management. "But overall, the Fed will be concerned by the very stubborn nature of inflation and will be increasingly cautious about the upside inflation risks that President-elect Trump’s policies may bring." Trump's proposed policies, such as high tariffs on imported goods, tax cuts for corporations, and curbs on immigrationm are considered by economists to be potentially inflationary. Those policies could further complicate the Fed's path forward for interest rates. "We expect the Fed to move off autopilot in January, adopting a more cautious tone, and slowing its pace of cuts to just every other meeting," Shah said. Assuming a 25 basis point cut next week, markets are pricing in another two to three cuts in 2025, according to the latest Bloomberg data. Read more here. US stocks enjoyed broad-based gains early Wednesday as consumer prices rose as forecast in November, cementing bets the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its policy meeting next week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) moved up about 0.2%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) jumped nearly 0.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) added to the across-the-board gains, rising roughly 0.8%. New inflation data out Wednesday showed consumer prices rose as forecast in November, reflecting another month where price increases made little progress toward the Federal Reserve's 2% target. The latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that the Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased 2.7% over the prior year in November, a slight uptick from October's 2.6% annual gain in prices. The yearly increase matched economist expectations. The index rose 0.3% over the previous month, matching economists' expectations but higher than the 0.2% seen in October. On a "core" basis, which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, prices in October climbed 0.3% over the prior month, matching October, and 3.3% over last year for the fourth consecutive month.

LAS VEGAS, NEVADA - DECEMBER 3: An attendee passes an AWS logo at AWS re:Invent 2024, a conference ... [+] hosted by Amazon Web Services, at The Venetian Las Vegas on December 3, 2024 in Las Vegas, Nevada. (Photo by Noah Berger/Getty Images for Amazon Web Services) Amazon stock (NASDAQ: AMZN) has fared well this year, rising by close to 50% so far. This is well ahead of fellow big tech titans Apple and Alphabet which remain up by about 34% each. Amazon has clearly gotten a lot of things right. Amazon’s massive recommence infrastructure investments made over the last several years are showing clear signs of paying off, as operating profits surge. The company has also executed well on its advertising business. Also see, Buy, Sell, Or Hold Costco Stock? Amazon is also seen as a big winner in the generative AI space, driven by its cloud business. Also, Google has announced a potential tech breakthrough. See What’s Happening With Google Stock? So what are some of the recent developments for Amazon stock? Amazon is doubling down on designing its proprietary AI chips. Last week, the company unveiled Trainium3, its most powerful in-house AI chip, which it says is 2x as fast as its predecessor, Trainium2, while delivering roughly 40% better energy efficiency. The chips are expected to be available in 2025 and will reportedly be fabricated using TSMC’s latest 3nm technology. Whether development goes smoothly or runs into delays, could add volatility to the stock price. Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. Amazon is marketing its AI products to other companies. For instance, Apple says that uses Amazon’s AI chips for certain tasks such as search. The consumer tech giant has also indicated that it was evaluating if the latest Amazon chip can be used to train AI models included in Apple Intelligence. Separately, Amazon announced plans for a massive AI supercomputer built using hundreds of thousands of Trainium2 chips. While Amazon is expected to remain a significant customer of Nvidia’s cutting-edge GPUs, its in-house chip development could eventually help it lower costs for its AWS business and potentially build new revenue streams. See why it may be time to sell Nvidia stock and buy Intel Amazon is expanding into the automotive space with its new venture Amazon Autos, which will enable customers to purchase vehicles in 48 U.S. cities. The platform will initially focus on selling new cars, with South Korea’s Hyundai starting off as its launch partner. Amazon has indicated that it intends to gradually expand by adding more brands, as well as cities in the coming years. Amazon will act as a go-between, connecting customers to local dealerships that will remain the final sellers of the vehicles. Although Amazon has little experience in the auto industry, its vast and highly engaged customer base as well as the widespread dissatisfaction with traditional car dealership experiences should give it a meaningful opportunity. Now looking over a slightly longer period, the returns for Amazon stock have been more volatile than the S&P 500 at 2% in 2021, -50% in 2022, and 81% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Amazon stock is increasingly seen as a reasonable value. While the company has historically traded at negative or triple-digit price-to-earnings ratios, its valuation metrics are improving. The company’s stock currently trades at about 35x 2025 consensus earnings. Although revenue growth may slow, Amazon’s margins are clearly on an upward trajectory. Amazon has implemented effective cost management strategies, adopting a more measured hiring pace and enhancing operational efficiency. Over the last quarter, Amazon’s cloud division, reported an operating income of $10.4 billion, a remarkable 50% increase year-over-year, significantly outpacing revenue growth of 19%. Amazon has also been tweaking its capex strategy, reducing spending on lower-return e-commerce infrastructure, while doubling down on technology infrastructure to meet rising artificial intelligence demand. At its current market price of $225, the stock is trading roughly in line with the Trefis price estimate of $230 per share - the Trefis estimate for Amazon’s valuation.

Title: Virtualizing GCP data by using Fabric Shortcuts: Data Engineering with Fabric

Time Published: 2024-12-11T00:00:11Z

John Miner, 2024-12-11 Before the invention of shortcuts in Microsoft Fabric, big data engineers had to create pipelines to read data from external sources such as Google Cloud Platform (GCP) buckets and write into Azure Data Lake Storage. This duplication of data is at risk of becoming stale over time. Additionally, computing power might be wasted on bringing over data that is used one time. With today’s companies being comprised of mergers and acquisitions over time, your company’s data landscape might exist in multiple cloud vendors. How can we virtualize the data stored in GCP buckets in our Microsoft Fabric Lakehouse design? Our manager has asked us to create a virtualized data lake using GCP buckets and Microsoft Fabric Lakehouse. The new shortcut feature will be used to link to both files and delta tables. Most of the article will be centered around setting up a GCP trial account, loading data into GCP buckets, and creating a service account to access those buckets. Once the data is linked, a little work will be needed to either create a managed delta table or test linked delta tables. At the end of this article, the big data engineer will be comfortable with Microsoft Fabric Shortcuts using GCP buckets as a source. We need an account within google first before we can start a trial subscription. Go to the following URL to start the process. For some reason, you have to supply a birthdate and gender as part of the sign-up process. Google will suggest some account names that are not currently in use. The name I gave my user account is gcp2fabric. This describes how we want the data to flow from GCP to Fabric. Most cloud systems want a recovery email. That way if the google account gets locked, a password reset email can be sent to my john@craftydba.com mailbox. There is always a review or confirm page when using a graphical user interface. Hit the next button to see the details. Make sure you add a recovery mobile phone. Both the email and phone are verified by receiving and verifying access codes. Go to the security screen to enable two factor authentication for a product system. Because this is a proof of concept, I am going to use a username and strong password. The free credits from Google Cloud Platform are quite nice. It is $300 dollars or 90 days. Whichever limit comes first ends the trial. Make sure you are signed in with you google account and then start the trial process. The payment verification screen is a two-part process. First, you must enter billing information. Second, you will need a credit card to back the account. The card is never charged. But watch out for those pesky popups that ask you to convert to a real account. That is when the billing starts! Here is yet another set of demographic screens in which Google wants my personal information. To recap, creating both a Google Account and Google Cloud Platform trial are very easy tasks. The main idea behind Fabric Shortcuts is the virtualization of data from GCP to Fabric using memory to cache the files. There are five steps to create a GCP bucket: supply a name, choose a region, pick a storage class, determine access controls, and select a data protection strategy. Be careful when using the upload folder button. If you are impatient and do not wait, partial folder/file uploads might occur. If you are a patient person, then just wait for the start and end notifications. Right now, we have a storage account with five folders worth of stock data. However, we do not have any way to access the bucket. Most cloud vendors have the idea of a service account. Usually, this account does not have access to the cloud console. It is intended for use with programs to automate a task. Go to the settings section of the GCP bucket. Choose the create a key for a service account button. The name of the service account is not important since we just need the access key and access secret. I chose to name the service account as svc-gcp2fabric-poc. I chose to give the service account administrator access to the folders in this bucket. Click the create a key option under settings to generate the key for the service account. Please record both the key and the secret. The secret cannot be retrieved after you close this screen. The next step is to test access to the storage account using a program. The cloud tools for PowerShell is where you can learn about the cmdlets available to the PowerShell programmer. Run the code snippet below to get started. The first statement installs the cmdlets for PowerShell. The second command installs the command line interface (CLI). One must use the command line to authenticate to the cloud service before you can execute PowerShell cmdlets in your favorite tool. I am using VS code with the PowerShell extension. The next few screens go over the installation program for the Google CLI. The above screen starts the installation process. The screen below shows the license agreement. Click I agree with the licensing to continue. You can install the CLI interface for the current user or all users. The destination directory is aptly named. If you want to change the location, do it now. The process extracts the components from the downloaded bundle. The tools are finally installed. Click next to continue. The gcloud init command from the CLI shell starts a local sign in process to GCP using the default web browser. The SDK is smart enough to find three accounts assigned to my profile information. We want the last account which was created for this demonstration. Now that the tools are installed, we can test downloading and uploading files to the GCP Bucket. I used the Google Cloud cmdlets to create four separate tests. I am assuming you have logged into GCP using the CLI. The command shell output from the CLI command is shown below. The complete PowerShell script is shown below. Please load the script into VS Code that has been set up with the latest PowerShell add-in. I created four separate tasks in the script. Use the $test variable to determine which test to run next. The first task is to show the buckets in my GCP project. I used the Get-GcsBucket cmdlet retrieve the output seen below. The second task is to get a list of all files into a variable named $files. The Get-GcsObject cmdlet returns detailed information of each file stored in the bucket. We want to filter just for Microsoft stock data. Since there is five years of data, we are expecting five files in the result set. Please see the image below for details. The third task is to download those files into a local directory named gcp-bucket-test. The Remove-Item cmdlet allows us to remove any existing files before downloading from the bucket. The error action is set to silently continue if there are no files. The Read-GcsObject cmdlet is used to download a single file. If you refer back to the script at the beginning of this section, the download is a culmination of the first two tests plus a for loop. The very last test is to upload the advwrks folder to the cloud. This folder contains 11 delta tables. The image shows the working directory for our GCP bucket test. The New-GcsObject cmdlet uploads a folder from local storage to cloud storage. The output shows the parquet and json files being uploaded to the GCP cloud. The exploration of the PowerShell cmdlets has given me more confidence that the shortcuts will work. However, we did not test the access key and secret with code yet. There are two types of shortcuts supported in the Fabric Lakehouse. The first shortcut allows the developer to virtualize files. The second shortcut virtualizes the Delta Tables in the Lakehouse Hive Catalog. Let’s first work with the File Shortcuts. Today, we are going to work with the GCP shortcuts that are in preview. Please enter information about the bucket URL as well as the service account. That saved information for a HMAC key comes in handy right now. Here is a professional tip. Create the shortcuts using the lowest directory level. I want a shortcut for each folder in the GCP bucket. The new short screen basically asks you to double check your work at this time. Now, we want to create shortcuts for the eleven Delta Tables. The GUI is smart enough to know we created a connection already for this storage URL. Again, choose the lowest leaf in the directory tree for shortcuts. This will result in a shortcut for each folder that contains a delta table. One more verification of shortcuts needs to be done before our tasks are completed. Now that shortcuts are defined for Files and Tables, it is time to create some Python code in a Spark notebook to test them. The quickest test is to use the GUI in Fabric to inspect the various shortcuts. The image below shows the data in the currency Delta Table from the Adventure Works database. We can even preview the data stored in a CSV file. Since we are working with GCP, I want to see the GOGGLE stock prices in 2013.11 The files for the S&P 500 data set are interesting in themselves. However, having this data in a single Delta Table by year is more user friendly than hundreds of files. The PySpark code below uses a list of years as a metadata driver for loading each of the directories into a single Delta Table. The output from running the above cell in Microsoft Fabric Lakehouse is below. Each year has about 125,000 records or more of data. Business Users come up with interesting requests. We have been asked to create tables just for Amazon, Google and Microsoft stock data. How can we achieve this result? The code below uses the same year list as a driver for the for-loop. We are going to create dynamic SQL to union all file tables together. The secret to this technique is to use the result SELECT statement as input to the CREAT TABLE AS statement. Now that we have the Amazon stock data, we can group and aggregate to find the number of trading days per month and the average stock price. The code below uses Spark SQL to look at the data ranked by month and year. The output from the Spark SQL statement is shown below. This is a good test since we used all five File shortcuts and have read all stock data files. If we look at the Lakehouse Object Explorer, we can see 6 new tables have been created. I leave using the CTAS code to create tables for both Google and Microsoft as an exercise for the reader. The next set of code joins 8 of the 11tables in the adventure works schema into a flattened reporting table named rpt_prepared_data. Now to solve the business question of what sold the most by year, month, region, and model. The output of this query can be ranked by Total Amount to make the result stand out. I leave that improvement as an exercise for you to try. The output shows the last month of 2010 and the first month of 2011. The road-150 model was very popular in December 2010 in both North America and the Pacific. One last test to complete our analysis. We know that shortcuts are read only. What happens if we try to write to a folder that is a shortcut? The above Python snippet fails with the following output. In short, this operation is not supported through shortcuts. The creation of the GCP resources was the hardest part of this article. When creating shortcuts to a GCP bucket, you need to create a service account with access to the bucket. Create an Access Key and Secret commonly known as an HMAC key. Microsoft PowerShell can be used to validate uploading and downloading files and folders. There are two types of shortcuts. File shortcuts point to folders in the GCP bucket. The files in these buckets can be of any type that the Spark Engine can read. By themselves, these files are not useful. Use the Spark Engine to read, translate and write the information to a delta table. Managed delta tables are where you want to be. One Lake shortcuts or shortcuts to Tables require the source data to be in a delta file format. Selecting the lowest level folder in the directory structure makes each folder look like a table. Up to 50 shortcuts can be created at one time using the graphical user interface within the Fabric console. To summarize, shortcuts are read only pointers to tables and files. The tables can stand by themselves since they are in the delta file format. The files must be ingested into your local One Lake to be of any reporting value. I really like shortcuts and will be exploring the last cloud vendor, Microsoft Azure, in the future. Log in or register to rate You rated this post out of 5.

Title: Sell LULU Stock, Buy EBAY?

The logo of e-commerce company Ebay is pictured at an exhibition booth for vehicle parts at the ... [+] Essen Motor Show in Essen, western Germany on December 4, 2024. (Photo by Ina FASSBENDER / AFP) (Photo by INA FASSBENDER/AFP via Getty Images) We believe that the internet retail company eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) is currently a better pick over the apparel retail company, Lululemon stock. Although these companies are from different industries, they belong to the consumer cyclical sector and share a similar revenue base of around $10 billion. EBAY stock trades at 3.2x trailing revenues, versus 5.0x for LULU. We think this gap in valuation will narrow in favor of EBAY in the coming years. There is more to the comparison, and in the sections below, we discuss why we think EBAY will outperform LULU in the next three years. We compare a slew of factors, such as historical revenue growth, returns, and valuation. Separately, check out What’s Behind The 80% Rise In META Stock? EBAY stock has seen gains of 45% from levels of $45 in early January 2021 to around $65 now, vs. an increase of about 15% for LULU stock from $350 to $405. This compares with 60% gains for the broader S&P 500 index over this four-year period. However, the increase in these stocks has been far from consistent. Returns for EBAY stock were 34% in 2021, -36% in 2022, 8% in 2023, and 49% so far in 2024, while that for LULU stock were 12%, -18%, 60%, and -22%, respectively. In comparison, returns for the S&P 500 have been 27% in 2021, -19% in 2022, 24% in 2023, and 28% so far this year — indicating that EBAY underperformed the S&P in 2022 and 2023, and LULU underperformed the S&P in 2021 and 2024. In fact, consistently beating the S&P 500 — in good times and bad — has been difficult over recent years for individual stocks; for heavyweights in the Consumer Discretionary sector including PG, and AMZN, and even for the megacap stars GOOG, TSLA, and MSFT. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 the last 3 years over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. eBay has seen its revenue rise at an average annual rate of 5% from $8.9 billion in 2020 to $10.3 billion now. On the other hand, Lululemon’s average revenue growth rate of 30% from $4.4 billion in fiscal 2021 (fiscal ends in January) to $10.2 billion now has been comparatively much faster. eBay’s revenue growth lately has been driven by growth in its focus categories, which includes auto parts and accessories, collectibles, handbags, refurbished goods, and luxury fashion. This has helped it see higher gross merchandise volume and take rate over the recent quarters. The company has been targeting AI to bolster its sales by offering personalized recommendations. Its focus on certain categories, such as auto parts and accessories, seems to be working well for the company. Still, eBay faces tough competition from the likes of Amazon, Walmart, Etsy, and Temu, among others. Lululemon’s revenue growth lately has been driven by strong growth in China and international markets. For perspective, China sales were up a whopping 67% y-o-y in 2023, and another 39% so far this year. China now accounts for 13% of the company’s total sales, versus 8% in 2021. However, the company’s largest market – the Americas region – is seeing tepid growth lately, up just 2% for the nine-month period ending October 2024. This can be attributed to a change in consumer spending trends and rising competition. Looking forward, we expect Lululemon to see a high-single-digit average growth rate in the coming years, led by continued growth in China, versus a low single-digit rate for eBay. eBay’s operating margin fell from 29.6% in 2020 to 19.2% in 2023, while Lululemon’s operating margin expanded from 19.3% in fiscal 2021 to 22.9% in fiscal 2024. If we look at the last twelve-month period, Lululemon’s operating margin of 23.3% fares better than 21.3% for eBay. Lululemon’s profitability is superior compared to some of its peers, including Nike, with operating profit margin of 11.8% and 9.2% for On Holding. For eBay, the decline in profitability lately can be attributed to increased spending on R&D to improve its product experience. From a financial risk perspective, eBay seems to have an edge over Lululemon. Its 25% debt as a percentage of equity is slightly lower than 26% for Lululemon, while its 45% cash as a percentage of assets is much higher than 17% for the latter. This implies that eBay has a better debt position and has more cash cushion. We see that LULU has seen better revenue growth and is more profitable. On the other hand, eBay has a better financial position. Now, looking at valuation, we think EBAY is the better choice of the two. EBAY, at its current levels of $65 trades at 3.2x trailing revenues, versus the stock’s average P/S ratio of 2.8x over the last three years. In comparison, LULU stock trades at 5.ox trailing revenues, versus the stock’s average P/S ratio of 6.7x over the last three years. However, for LULU, a decline in valuation multiple seems justified, given the slowing sales growth from around 30% average rate in the last three years to a high single-digit expected growth rate in the next three years. The company also faced a backlash after the launch of Breezethrough leggings, with a V-shaped back seam, earlier this year. The product received negative reviews at large, and the company decided to pull the product from the market. Lululemon also faces increased competition in the athleisure market. Overall, we think LULU stock is overpriced at levels of around $400, while EBAY may offer some room for growth in the coming years, as it focuses on improving the GMV using generative AI capabilities. While EBAY may outperform LULU in the next three years, it is helpful to see how eBay’s Peers fare on metrics that matter.

Title: Ways To Invest In Tesla Beyond Buying TSLA Stock

Time Published: 2024-12-09T21:46:09Z
Full Content:
© 2024 Bloomberg Finance LP Tesla (TSLA) is one of the most closely followed and debated stocks. That’s what happens when you create a new industry (electric vehicles) and trade in a price range from $100 to $400, and back to $100 again, all within a few years time. And let’s not forget the emergence of Tesla founder Elon Musk on the political front. All this may lead investors to wonder how best to get exposure to Tesla stock, other than buying it directly. That’s where exchange-traded funds can represent a wide range of “access points” for different types of objectives. Popular indexes like the S&P 500 have ETFs that allow investors to profit from its declines, to earn extra income from it via option positions, and to add leverage. More recently, allowing investors to put those types of enhancements around individual stocks has been a priority for some ETF product creators. But in the case of Tesla, we might just have the widest array of choices for how to “drive” your profits forward. Here are seven I picked out, and how I’d potentially use them. Note that these are my own observations and research. They are not recommendations, simply a way to expand the range of what is possible for investors who don’t drill down on this as I have been doing for decades. Do your own due diligence before making any investment decisions.

AMZN is 22% and Home Depot (HD) checks in at 8%. So nearly half of XLY is in these three stocks. XLY has $24.3 billion in assets under management and a low expense ratio of 0.09%. I want to own Tesla but with some diversification around it. This is one way in which my approach to ETF investing is likely very different from most. I like concentrated funds, since it allows me to zero in on a smaller basket of names that at times are really all I want from that market segment. I don't need a piece of 93 stocks in a single sector! This is for investors who prefer to reduce the risk of any single stock. The focus of this ETF is long-term growth of capital achieved by investing in companies that benefit from the development of new products and technologies, such as autonomous mobility, intelligent devices, adaptive robotics, neural networks, reusable rockets and advanced batteries. Tesla is ARKQ’s top holding (17% of assets). ARKQ has total assets of $968 million and an expense ratio of 0.75%. Complements TSLA exposure with allocations to defense, cybersecurity and space exploration. Volatility. Made a big “round trip” in price the past three years, losing 50% and then gaining 100% to net out to a break-even over that period. I want to own TSLA and other autonomous tech stocks, but not Amazon. This is also a diversification move around Tesla stock, though using a thematic group of stocks instead of just those in the same consumer discretionary sector. This is TSLA times 2, though it is not always that simple. As with all ETFs that, like this one, employ leverage, the concept of making 2x the gain or loss of TSLA should be assumed to only be good on a daily basis.Still when TSLA goes on one of those manic upside runs, 2x is an attractive consideration to me. TSLL has an expense ratio of 0.96%. “All bulled up” on Tesla, with potential to make twice as much as owning the regular common stock. What Tesla giveth twice as much, it also taketh away twice as much. Since I'm a chartist at the core, I can decide to buy a good TSLA chart or buy a good TSLL chart with half the assets at risk. This ETF might appeal to those who are comfortable with leverage, pursuing twice the gain with twice the risk. Leveraged ETFs are a relatively new creation. Single inverse ETFs have been around since 2006. And that means I've been using them liberally for 18 years. The ones that move opposite major market indexes have been a "go-to" for me as an offense-defense investor since prior to the global financial crisis. Newer on the scene are single stock inverse ETFs, such as the ones offered by Direxion, T-Rex and other fund firms. Again, the daily objective means that longer time periods often will not be the mirror image of the underlying "long" stock performance. TSLS has an expense ratio of 1.07%. Efficient way to essentially “short” TSLA, on a 1:1 daily basis. Investors tend to undereducate themselves on the “math of investment loss.” In other words, if TSLA goes up 20% as it has done in short time periods many times, this would drop approximately 20%. But that means you need to make 25% just to get back to even, not 20%. When I think TSLA is overpriced short-to-intermediate term, and want to try to profit from a potential decline of some magnitude. TSLS could appeal to those who wish to try to profit from a decline in TSLA. Note that big “round trip” move I noted at the start of this article.

That would not have worked well if held throughout 2024. But don't be fooled by that full-year summary. During the course of this, its first full year of existence, TSLZ has had 1-month up moves of 80%, 50% and 30%. These are tactical vehicles, period. Potentially a “cleaner” way to try to capitalize on declines in Tesla stock than using put options. That’s because TSLA is so volatile, buying options can be very expensive. I own TSLA but am concerned about its near-term price picture, so I can consider this to hedge some of that, and try to avoid the full downside risk. Or, I can use this to try to profit from the next major dip in TSLA. For those who don’t just think the stock will fall, but do so quickly, this ETF, like other inverse funds, aims to be held for short time periods. This is another in the series from YieldMax ETFs that I've written about here recently. TSLY aims to deliver a very high income return and a total return of about 80% of the ups and downs of TSLA stock. TSLY has total assets of $1.0 billion and an expense ratio of 1.0% Big income payout, aims to capture about 80% of up moves in TSLA on a total return basis. Tends to track about 80% of the downside in the stock. Bullish on TSLA but prefer to earn more of my total return as income, with some upside potential beyond that. This relatively new ETF might appeal to those who want to ride along with Tesla, but exchange some potential capital appreciation for current income. Finally, another one from YieldMax, but a departure from their core product line. This fund, which has an expense ratio of 0.99%, started trading in May, so I'll use this directly from the fund management firm: YieldMax Short TSLA Option Income Strategy ETF is an actively managed ETF that seeks to generate monthly income from a synthetic covered put strategy on TSLA, while providing indirect short exposure to the share price of TSLA. CRSH seeks to benefit when the TSLA share price decreases, however CRSH’s potential corresponding benefit from decreases in the TSLA share price is limited. CRSH seeks to manage potential losses (i.e., cap losses if the TSLA share price experiences significant gains) by purchasing OTM call options. Big income payout. This brand new ETF is only for the very bold, and who are bearish on Tesla stock. It produces a high income level, but declined more than 40% of its price during its first six months in existence. The good news on TSLA: it has more than doubled since last spring. The bad news on TSLA: that giant move brought it back to where it traded about three years ago. I'm no fan of "dead money” (old Wall Street term) especially when it comes in the form of a political football, which was halfway to a meme stock even before the founder ended up in a potentially influential quasi-government position. There's a lot to consider here, and this story is much more complex than a lot of places I can decide to put my money. Knowing that these ETFs exist is step one. Understanding them is step two. Determining how to use them, when to use them and how to avoid getting burned from anything related to Tesla's volatile underlying stock price movement is all part of the "next level" of learning how to design portfolios for modern markets.

Title: Amazon should buy Bitcoin, shareholders say
URL: https://qz.com/amazon-shareholders-add-bitcoin-1851716582
Time Published: 2024-12-09T16:42:04Z
Full Content:
Shareholders of Amazon (AMZN-0.71%) have submitted a proposal to add Bitcoin to the balance sheet. The shareholders of the e-commerce giant are urging the company to learn from MicroStrategy (MSTR+2.57%), which heavily invested in Bitcoin, resulting in an increase in its share price. “MicroStrategy – which holds Bitcoin on its balance sheet – has had its stock outperform Amazon stock by 537% in the previous year,” according to a shareholder proposal shared by conservative think tank the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR). “At minimum, Amazon should evaluate the benefits of holding some, even just 5%, of its assets in Bitcoin,” the proposal added. The proposal comes at a time when shareholders of tech giant Microsoft (MSFT-0.67%) are set to vote on Tuesday on whether to invest in Bitcoin. As of this writing, Bitcoin is currently around $99,000 after surpassing the historic $100,000 milestone. The think tank highlighted several institutional and corporate examples to illustrate why Amazon should consider investing in Bitcoin. It pointed to public companies like Tesla (TSLA+2.10%) and Block (SQ-0.47%), which have already added Bitcoin to their balance sheets. Furthermore, the think tank noted that Amazon’s second and fourth largest institutional shareholders, BlackRock (BLK-0.12%) and Fidelity, have launched Bitcoin ETFs, signaling growing confidence in the cryptocurrency’s potential. Additionally, it suggested that even the U.S. government might establish a Bitcoin strategic reserve as early as 2025, underscoring the increasing mainstream acceptance of Bitcoin as a strategic asset. The think tank emphasized the importance of diversifying Amazon’s holdings, even considering Bitcoin’s volatility. According to the proposal, as of September 30, 2024, Amazon’s total assets amounted to $585 billion, with $88 billion held in cash, cash equivalents, and bonds. “Since cash is consistently being debased and bond yields are lower than the true nation rate, Amazon isn’t adequately protecting billions of dollars of shareholder value simply by holding these assets,” said NCPPR. The think tank argued that Bitcoin outperforms bonds as an investment. As of December 6, 2024, Bitcoin’s price had risen by 131% over the past year, surpassing corporate bonds, which saw an average increase of just 5%, per the proposal. This performance highlights Bitcoin’s potential as a more lucrative alternative to traditional bond investments. Whether or not Amazon decided to add Bitcoin, that’s in the future. However, the way its shareholders have argued in favor of Bitcoin represents how the perception of Bitcoin has changed over the years and how it is getting accepted and becoming more mainstream with each passing day.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. A group of Amazon (AMZN, Financial) shareholders, led by the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), has recommended that Amazon invest at least 5% in bitcoins. The measure interceptor for review ahead of the 2025 AGM will seek to fix the issue caused by Amazon entering the cryptocurrency market, given that Bitcoin has outperformed most assets, including corporate bonds. Interestingly, MicroStrategy (MSTR, Financial), the company that has chosen to integrate Bitcoin as part of its treasury management, had a significantly better score of 537% when compared to Amazon's stock price in the last year. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with AMZN. This proposal has also highlighted the increasing institutional adoption of bitcoins; different stakeholders, such as Amazon's shareholders, BlackRock, and Fidelity, offer bitcoin ETFs to their clients. This is well in tune with the trend of big firms like Tesla and Block incorporating cryptocurrencies in their working capital. The NCPPR thinks that Bitcoin may create inflation protection and increase steadiness in shareholder value with time. Amazon has yet to make a public response to the proposal; however, its board will have to analyze and decide whether or not to propose the change in the proxy statement for the 2025 meeting. The NCPPR's push comes after an attempt to get Microsoft(MSFT, Financial) to include the digital currency on its balance sheet, which was rejected by the shareholders.

Title: Will Amazon Buy Bitcoin? Shareholders Propose 5% Investment

Time Published: 2024-12-09T07:00:02Z
Full Content:
Shareholders of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) have submitted a proposal urging the $2.3 trillion technology conglomerate to consider adding Bitcoin to its balance sheet. The measure, submitted by the National Center for Public Policy Research and slated for discussion at Amazon’s 2025 annual shareholder meeting in April, calls on the company’s Board to assess whether incorporating BTC as a treasury asset would serve the best long-term interests of shareholders. In the proposal, shareholders stress that Amazon’s current treasury management may be insufficient in the face of ongoing inflation. As stated in the submission: “Corporations that invest their assets wisely can – and often do – increase shareholder value more than more profitable businesses that don’t.” According to the supporting materials, Amazon’s current treasury includes approximately $88 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, out of a total $585 billion in assets (as of September 30, 2024). The proposal’s authors argue that inflationary pressures and sub-inflationary bond yields are eroding the purchasing power of these holdings. They cite a US Consumer Price Index (CPI) average annual rate of 4.95% over the past four years, at times peaking at 9.1%, while suggesting that “in reality, the true inflation rate is significantly higher.” Against this backdrop, the submission suggests that Amazon has a “fiduciary duty” to consider inflation-resistant assets. The shareholders point to Bitcoin’s historical returns to bolster their case. They note that as of December 6, 2024, BTC price rose 131% over the previous year, outperforming corporate bonds “by 126% on average.” Over a five-year horizon, Bitcoin’s price increased by 1,246%, surpassing corporate bond returns by an estimated 1,242% during that period. “Amazon should – and perhaps has a fiduciary duty to – consider adding assets to its treasury that appreciate more than bonds, even if those assets are more volatile short-term,” the proposal states. The document also references other publicly listed firms that hold BTC. MicroStrategy, one of the earliest corporate adopters, saw its stock outperform Amazon’s by 537% over the previous year, according to the proposal. In addition, institutional players such as BlackRock and Fidelity—both of which hold significant stakes in Amazon—have introduced Bitcoin-focused investment products for their clients. The shareholders further suggest that U.S. government policy could shift toward a “Bitcoin strategic reserve” by 2025, possibly signaling broader mainstream acceptance. “Shareholders request that the Board conduct an assessment to determine if adding Bitcoin to the Company’s treasury is in the best long-term interests of shareholders,” the proposal concludes. This push at Amazon comes on the heels of a similar initiative at Microsoft. As reported by Bitcoinist, Microsoft (MSF) shareholders are set to vote on December 10 on a proposal to include Bitcoin in its treasury as a reserve asset. However, analysts note that the chances of approval are low after the Microsoft Board recommended a “no” vote. At press time, BTC traded at $99,136. For updates and exclusive offers enter your email.
