Title: What's Going on With Oracle? Its Stock Price Has Dropped More Than 40% in Two Months.

Betting big on artificial intelligence is proving to be a double-edged sword. Shares of Oracle (ORCL), the almost-50 year-old software company turned AI play, rallied furiously during the summer as investor enthusiasm for what could be the next transformative technology surged. Lately the company's stock has given up much of those gains, down more than 40% from its all-time high in September, more than other related plays including Meta Platforms (META), Palantir Technologies (PLTR) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), whose stocks declined at least 20% from their respective peaks. Now investors are looking at Oracle as the poster child for AI-related excess. Though concerns about AI valuations have been lingering for years, investors have recently started to pan stocks tied to the theme, weighing the amount companies are spending to develop the tech against the potential for future revenue. Oracle has come under increased scrutiny since it raised $18 billion in new debt last month to fund its infrastructure buildout, pushing its overall debt to over $100 billion. In January, Oracle announced that it was joining forces with ChatGPT maker OpenAI and Japanese tech giant Softbank on a $500 billion project, called Stargate, to develop AI infrastructure in the U.S. It's become increasingly difficult to view AI-related businesses in a vacuum, because of the relationships they've created between each other with multi-billion dollar deals. In that way Oracle's hurt could turn into pain for others. Oracle's quarterly earnings report in early September blew past Wall Street expectations, sending the stock soaring 36% in one day and briefly making co-founder and Executive Chairman Larry Ellison the world's richest person. A few weeks later, however, the company announced that longtime CEO Safra Catz would be replaced as CEO, and the stock has been declining ever since. Meanwhile, traders have started to pile into Oracle's credit-default swaps as a way to both hedge and bet against the AI trade, according to a recently published story by Bloomberg. Credit default swaps are derivative contracts that serve as a kind of insurance against the possibility that a borrower will default on its debt obligations. Consensus capital expenditures for AI hyperscalers, including Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOGL), Meta, Microsoft (MSFT) and Oracle have risen to $533 billion now from $467 billion at the start of the third-quarter earnings season, according to Goldman Sachs. Oracle is also a major part of the web of deals between AI software makers, chip companies and cloud operators, whose circular deals—possibly indicating more self-dealing than representative of organic demand—have raised eyebrows. The Wall Street Journal reported that a large chunk of the outsize revenue backlog unveiled in its September earnings report was from an OpenAI deal. "The feedback loops created by the revenue and equity relationships between some of the largest U.S. public companies and smaller AI firms increase the risk that stress in one part of the AI ecosystem affects investors across the AI complex," Goldman analysts led by Ryan Hammond said in a report published earlier this week.

Title: Want $4,000 per Year in Monthly Passive Income? Invest Just $2,500 in These Yield-Heavy Dividend Stocks

Investing Sending You to Google News in 3 © Panchenko Vladimir / Shutterstock.com It would be an impressive feat to generate $4,000 in yearly passive income with just $12,500 in your account. Yet, it’s actually possible if you invest $2,500 into five carefully chosen stocks or exchange traded funds (ETFs). Not only that, but you could get paid cash distributions every month and possibly even every week. The plan is to own high-yield stocks that represent profitable businesses which pay monthly dividends. Also, you can own some ETFs offering big yields and frequent cash payouts. Allocating $2,500 toward the five assets on today’s list means you’d be investing $12,500 in total. It’s possible to earn $4,000 per year in dividends/distributions is you achieve an average yield of at least $4,000 / $12,500 or 32%. Sure, that’s ambitious and these five stocks/ETFs carry some risk; for example, any of the annual yields might get cut. On the other hand, you could become a passive income overachiever simply by holding five assets, so let’s start off with two high-paying stock picks. We’ll begin with Oxford Square Capital Corp. (NASDAQ:OXSQ), a business development company mainly specializing in bank loans and collateralized loan obligations (CLOs). Since Oxford Square Capital Corp. sends out its cash dividends on a monthly basis, you can take advantage of frequent reinvestment and compounding opportunities. It’s smart to focus on income-positive businesses in order to mitigate your overall risk level. As it turns out, Oxford Square Capital Corp. is income-positive as it reported roughly $5.56 million of third-quarter 2025 net investment income. At the moment, Oxford Square Capital Corp. offers a 22.46% forward annual dividend yield. This doesn’t measure up to our objective of achieving an average yield of at least 32%. Nevertheless, buying $2,500 worth of OXSQ stock is a good start as we’ll raise the average yield later with some mega-yield ETFs. Another stock you could invest $2,500 into is Orchid Island Capital (NYSE:ORC). This company is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that concentrates on U.S.-based residential mortgage-backed securities. Like Oxford Square Capital Corp., Orchid Island Capital pays dividends every month. Furthermore, Orchid Island Capital is a profitable business enterprise, having recorded $72.08 million in Q3 2025 net income. Being income-positive implies, more or less, that these companies should be able to continue paying monthly cash dividends. Currently, Orchid Island Capital stock investors can expect a 20.14% forward annual dividend yield. We’re still below our 32% average yield target, but there’s no need to fret as I’ve got a three-pack of ETFs that could bring massive payouts. To raise the bar in terms of overall annual yield, you could invest $2,500 into three funds from Roundhill. These ETFs all pay distributions on a weekly basis, so you can continue to receive cash payments every month or even more often than that. To provide a simplified explanation, the following Roundhill ETFs trade shares of a well-known stock as well as a type of derivatives known as swaps. This typically raises the risk level but also enables substantial income-generation opportunities. First, we have the Roundhill AMZN WeeklyPay ETF (CBOE:AMZW), which trades shares and swaps to indirectly extract income from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock. Unlike a direct investment in Amazon stock, you’ll receive weekly cash distributions if you hold AMZW shares. Clarifying the fund’s objective, Roundhill explains that the AMZW ETF targets “enhanced returns corresponding to 120% of” the weekly performance of AMZN stock. The expected annual distribution rate of the Roundhill AMZN WeeklyPay ETF is quite hefty at 37.57%. Next up is the Roundhill TSLA WeeklyPay ETF (CBOE:TSLW), which uses similar trading strategies to indirectly derive income from Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock. In particular, the TSLW ETF aims for “enhanced returns corresponding to 120% of” the weekly performance of TSLA stock. There’s risk involved as the share price of the Roundhill TSLA WeeklyPay ETF may be volatile. However, it’s hard to resist the fund’s massive 53.28% annual distribution rate, no doubt. Then there’s the Roundhill AVGO WeeklyPay ETF (CBOE:AVGW), which attempts to achieve similar results with Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock. Again, the share-price volatility risk shouldn’t be overlooked, but the AVGW ETF’s gigantic 54.68% distribution rate makes it a worthwhile addition to this list. So, have we reached or objective of a 32% or higher average annual yield? To fond out, we just need to add up the expected yields of OXSQ, ORC, AMZW, TSLW, and AVGW and then divide the total by five. The result is a 37.63% average annual yield between these five stocks/ETFs. Thus, we’ve put together a plan to earn at least $4,000 per year in dividends/distributions (assuming there are no yield cuts) with monthly or even weekly cash payments to your account.

Title: Google Stock Is Crushing the Rest of the Magnificent Seven—Here's Why

Alphabet has its groove back. Shares of Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) were up nearly 4% in Wednesday afternoon trading, pacing the Magnificent Seven as tech stocks found some footing after days of declines. The gains put Alphabet stock up about 55% since the start of the year, nearly 20 percentage points better than the Mag 7’s next-best performer, Nvidia (NVDA). Halfway through the year, it was in the red. Tech stocks have been pressured this month by anxiety about the sector's big investments in AI, but Alphabet is bucking the trend: Heading into Wednesday’s session, it was the only Mag 7 stock up since the start of November. The hottest Magnificent 7 stock this year is Nvidia, right? Nope: It's Alphabet, the Google parent that has lately gotten a lift from two rather disparate sources. One was Warren Buffett, the legendary investor whose company recently took a stake—and the other was optimism about the latest version of its Gemini AI model. Two developments have helped power the stock higher lately. Alphabet on Tuesday released Gemini 3, the latest iteration of its flagship AI model. Executives at Google DeepMind, the company's AI unit, called Gemini 3 “the best model in the world for multimodal understanding and our most powerful agentic and vibe coding model yet.” “I was impressed by it,” Ben Reitzes, head of tech research at Melius, said of Gemini 3 during an appearance on CNBC Wednesday. “I think it's a big leap from the prior models.” Reitzes said that investors were likely surprised by Alphabet’s claim yesterday that the Gemini app has more than 650 million monthly users, suggesting a strong competitive position. Alphabet stock also got a boost earlier this week from an unlikely source. Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) revealed it made a rare bet on tech with a nearly $5 billion investment in Alphabet last quarter, linking the stock to legendary investor and longtime CEO Warren Buffett, who is stepping down at the end of the year. The AI rally stalled in recent weeks amid concerns about overvalued tech stocks and unsustainable infrastructure spending. Some investors fear future AI demand will fail to meet Silicon Valley's expectations, leaving tech companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Oracle (ORCL) with a glut of data center capacity and, possibly, mountains of debt. Those concerns have prompted some to bet against big tech stocks. Alphabet's earnings report at the end of October may have allayed some of those fears, at least as they pertain to Google. Alphabet raised its full-year investment forecast for the third time this year, and reported that growth accelerated across the company. The results assured some investors that, contrary to expectations, AI is enhancing Google's core search business. Experts are generally optimistic about the outlook for Alphabet stock. Twelve of the 15 analysts with current ratings tracked by Visible Alpha recommend buying the stock, and the remainder rate it a "hold." Their average price target of $324 implies about 14% upside from Tuesday's close.
