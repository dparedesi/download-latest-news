Once a month, from 1989 to 2019, David Blitzer walked into a well-appointed conference room with a view of downtown Manhattan to discuss the 500 largest and most important public companies in the U.S., the ones whose stock just about any American can buy. Blitzer was a member of, and then chair of, the committee that makes the S&P 500. It's like the Billboard Hot 100, except instead of ranking the most popular songs in America, it lists the most valuable companies. Sabrina Carpenter wants to keep releasing pop anthems that keep her on the charts; Boeing wants to keep selling enough planes to stay in the S&P 500. The S&P 500 is famous. It's cited constantly in newspapers and on TV; it's the basis of millions of investing-for-retirement plans. Less well-known is that S&P Global, the company that makes the S&P 500 and that employed Blitzer, is itself on the S&P 500 list. One reason why is that S&P Global makes hundreds of millions of dollars every year in revenue just from the S&P 500. The company has other larger businesses, like rating bonds, but its indexing business is particularly lucrative and profitable. How do you profit wildly from a list of stocks that seemingly anyone could make? And why don't competitors erode those profits? Answering those questions requires a better understanding of the infrastructure behind Americans' go-to investing plan. It also shows how millions of Americans have, often unknowingly, bet their life savings on a few tech giants and the hundreds of billions of dollars they've invested in artificial intelligence. Loading... The S&P 500 is what's known as a stock market index, and its purpose is to be a barometer. Is the stock market up today? Was it down last week? Until the late 1800s, those were not easy questions to answer. But in 1896, financial journalists Charles Dow and Edward Jones created the Dow Jones index by averaging the share price of 12 large public companies. (It later expanded to 30 large stocks.) They used it to inform their columns and increase sales of their flagship paper, The Wall Street Journal. In 1957, S&P released a competitor: its now-iconic list of 500 stocks. At the time, it was a triumph of new technology. Tracking 500 stocks and updating the index took much more work and computing power, especially since S&P updated the index hourly, rather than just once per day. (Now it's updated constantly, in almost real time.) Also, the S&P 500 accounts for the size of each company and the number of shares. It was an improvement on the Dow Jones Industrial Average's price-weighted approach. In the Dow, companies with higher share prices have a larger impact on the index. So Goldman Sachs, whose share price is around $802, is much more important than Apple, whose share price is around $245.50. In contrast, the S&P 500 is weighted for market capitalization, the total amount invested in each company (the share price x number of shares outstanding). So if Netflix stock is up 1% and Apple is down 1%, that will nudge the S&P 500 down. Which makes sense! Way more people have way more money invested in Apple ($3.5 trillion) than Netflix (just over $500 billion). So, overall, investors had a down day. The S&P 500 is widely considered superior to the Dow for tracking the state of the stock market. Nevertheless, when David Blitzer joined the S&P 500 committee in 1989, the Dow was still the definitive stock market index. People in finance respected the S&P 500 — many professional investors used the index as a benchmark to see whether they were "beating the market," and they paid for access to the S&P 500 and related data. But it wasn't much money. Just a few years earlier, in 1982, "the income was zilch, almost," Blitzer says. So what changed? Three new financial products helped turn the S&P 500 into the dominant index and a golden goose: In each case, the companies paid to use the S&P 500 name, data and methodology. That fee was based on how much money people invested in S&P 500 index funds and ETFs (or spent on S&P 500 futures). So if a schoolteacher invested $30,000 of retirement savings in Vanguard's S&P 500 fund, Vanguard might charge that teacher $15 per year and give S&P a chunk of that $15. These novel products did not immediately make the S&P 500 a gold mine. The products were new, and investors were skeptical. So S&P's fees were modest. Blitzer says that when he became chair of the committee, in 1995, there were around 25 employees devoted to the S&P 500 and two other indexes they published. But "it grew incredibly," he adds. "You know, it was a good ride." A key period, Blitzer says, came in the late 1990s, as the dot-com bubble inflated. New internet companies like Yahoo grew and grew, and Blitzer and his colleagues duly added them to the S&P 500. (Yahoo replaced Laidlaw, North America's largest bus operator. "What it says is that the internet slowly but surely is becoming a key part of the U.S. economy," Blitzer told reporters in 1999.) The manic increases in internet stock prices pushed the S&P 500 up and up. "For 15 or 20 months, or maybe two years or more, the S&P 500 outperformed like 90% of all the mutual funds and ETFs in the market," says Blitzer. In other words, Wall Street's elite money managers — whom Americans gladly paid fat fees every year to invest their savings for them — were making lower returns (less per dollar invested, especially after accounting for fees) from the stock market than people who'd bought SPY or Vanguard's S&P 500 index fund. Blitzer's simple list of 500 stocks was one of the hottest portfolios on Wall Street, and getting access to it was cheap. The fees for SPY and index funds were a fraction of what elite Wall Street firms charged. So more and more families moved their retirement savings out of the hands of those active investors and into S&P 500 funds. What they were essentially doing was betting that America's 500 largest companies would keep growing and making profits — which is a pretty good, safe bet. The creators of the index chose 500 companies because it approximated the entire stock market: S&P 500 companies typically represent more than 75% of the entire American stock market (in terms of size, or market capitalization). And even as internet and tech stocks made up a larger and larger share of the S&P 500, people who bought SPY or index funds were still well diversified, since they were also investing in energy, health care and consumer-goods companies — which cushioned their losses when the tech bubble burst. This trend of people moving their retirement savings into index funds and ETFs has continued for decades. By the time Blitzer stepped down as chair of the S&P 500 committee in 2019, he says, their index business employed around 700 people, and they'd created so many indexes (the S&P Southeast Asia 40, the S&P Emerging Under $2 Billion, the S&P Municipal Bond Water & Sewer Index) that he legitimately did not know how many existed. (In the early 2010s, S&P also bought a controlling stake in the Dow Jones indexes; Dow Jones & Co. retains some affiliation with the indexes, but no ownership.) But the S&P 500 remains the crown jewel. In 2024, S&P Global earned $1.6 billion in revenue from its indexes business. Most of that revenue came from firms paying to use the S&P name for $16.6 trillion of index funds and other investments. Of that $16.6 trillion, a whopping $13 trillion came from SPY, Vanguard's S&P 500 index fund and similar investments. As a director and senior analyst at Mizuho Securities USA, Sean Kennedy closely follows seven companies so he can advise customers on whether to buy, hold or sell their stock. S&P Global is one of them. I ask whether he ever worries about S&P's indexes business faltering. "No," he responds instantly. "I think their moat is so impenetrable," he says, that customers ask him only really about other parts of S&P Global's business. By a "moat," Kennedy means the factors that prevent competitors from launching their own indexes and conquering S&P's castle (i.e., its customers and business). According to Kennedy and Blitzer, that moat consists of three main factors: The S&P 500 does have competitors. The London Stock Exchange Group has the Russell Indices, and MSCI publishes popular ones too. But their most prominent indexes are complements to the S&P 500, rather than competitors. From the perspective of S&P's customers, says Kennedy, "there's really no one you can switch to." What also sets the S&P 500 apart is the committee that Blitzer headed up for more than two decades. Even many finance experts are surprised to learn that it exists. They expect the S&P 500 to be like a formula: You calculate which companies are the 500 largest, in terms of share price and number of shares, and then publish the list. S&P publishes its methodology on its website, but it leaves some wiggle room to achieve other goals of the index, such as mitigating turnover and keeping the list representative of the broader market. That wiggle room was Blitzer's domain. In the early 1990s, for example, the committee held off on adding Microsoft to the index because founders Bill Gates and Paul Allen still owned more than 50% of the shares. In other cases, if two companies merged, creating one corporation large enough to make the S&P 500, the committee might similarly wait to see how the new company (and its stock price) fared before adding it. Blitzer said in a 2020 Bloomberg podcast that they sometimes "got pounded" for these decisions but "learned to shrug our shoulders and say wait till next month." He also suspects the committee's existence, as well as the fact that no one could fully predict the list, gave the S&P 500 some "aura." Potential changes were always a gossipy topic in business and finance. Even within the S&P office, no one knew for sure what Blitzer would announce. Since Blitzer retired in 2019, it's now someone else's job to pick the 500 stocks and endure the criticism. (That's now easier, however, because S&P keeps all members of the committee anonymous, in part so CEOs would stop FedEx-ing them quarterly reports and financial literature to lobby for inclusion in the S&P 500.) The biggest criticism in recent years, though, is not about a specific stock. It's that the S&P 500 no longer broadly represents the stock market. Just seven tech stocks — Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Nvidia, Tesla, Microsoft and Apple — have grown so huge that they make up more than 30% of the S&P 500. Increasingly, when the S&P 500 goes up or down, it reflects the performance of these "Magnificent 7" tech companies. Many economists, financial experts and money managers are concerned. Millions of people have invested trillions of dollars in S&P 500 funds with the idea that it's a well-diversified portfolio — a bet on the entire U.S. economy (or at least the large slice of it available to buy on stock markets), not a bet mostly on continued iPhone profits and AI chatbots becoming a profitable business. There are alternatives on offer. Firms like Vanguard offer index funds and other easy ways to invest in indexes of smaller companies, midsize companies, international stock markets or the "total" U.S. stock market — or to diversify into real estate. But as Blitzer points out, the Magnificent 7's domineering influence does not mean the S&P 500 is broken. The S&P 500 may be "pretty top heavy right now," but it has been top heavy before, in periods like the dot-com boom, and it still represents some 80% of American stock markets. The S&P 500 is doing its job: reflecting the state of the stock market and the investments everyone has decided to make. The point of the S&P 500 and the many investments based on it is to follow the markets — to trust its crowdsourced intelligence and not second-guess it or think you individually know better — because even though markets are sometimes very wrong, trusting them has an excellent track record over the long run. This is simply the state of our economy in 2025. Like it or not, it's increasingly a huge bet on a few tech giants and their massive investments in artificial intelligence startups, new data centers and AI being the next big thing.

Title: Steven Pinker on Speculation Bubbles, Super Bowl Ads, and What Leaders Need to Know About Group Psychology

A conversation with psychology professor Steven Pinker on a powerful force that unites us. As a leader, psychology is fundamental to your success – whether that means understanding consumer behavior, team dynamics, or even your own biases and blind spots. Harvard professor Steven Pinker says that an important phenomena to understand is that of common knowledge and its downstream effects. It’s the idea that there is power in knowledge, but also power in knowing what other people know – and that when a large group of people know what others around them know, and vice versa, that’s when major change can happen. He explains how common knowledge underlies meme stocks, the rise of crypto, meeting etiquette and the success of Super Bowl ads. Pinker wrote the new book When Everyone Knows That Everyone Knows . . .: Common Knowledge and the Mysteries of Money, Power, and Everyday Life. ADI IGNATIUS: I’m Adi Ignatius. ALISON BEARD: I’m Alison Beard, and this is the HBR IdeaCast. ADI IGNATIUS: All right. So Alison, the more I think about leadership, the more I think that leading effectively is almost all about psychology. ALISON BEARD: Yeah, I can see what you mean. You need to understand consumers’ wants and needs, your employees’ wants and needs, your business partner’s wants and needs. Really anticipating everything that stakeholders might do or think. ADI IGNATIUS: Yeah, exactly. I think successful leaders need to think on multiple levels, both to cope with the complexity of their jobs and to outthink their competition. So our guest today, Steven Pinker, is all about the power of knowledge. Understanding what we know, what we don’t know, and most importantly, whether or not others know what we know. So I know that sounds very Donald Rumsfeldian, but there is power in understanding all of this. ALISON BEARD: Yeah, it does sound very meta, but Pinker is an expert in explaining very complex topics in a way that feels understandable and applicable to our everyday lives. So I’m interested to hear what he has to say. ADI IGNATIUS: Absolutely. So Pinker is a professor of psychology at Harvard University, author of the new book, When Everyone Knows That Everyone Knows: Common Knowledge and the Mysteries of Money, Power, and Everyday Life. It’s a book that helps explain everything from the power of Super Bowl ads to the rise of cryptocurrency, to the unspoken rules of how we interact in the office. Here’s our conversation. ADI IGNATIUS: Steven, thank you for being with us today. STEVEN PINKER: Thanks for having me. ADI IGNATIUS: Great. So, your book is about common knowledge, what it is and how we use it and in ways that we’re aware of and in ways that we aren’t aware of. So, for the audience, what are you getting at with common knowledge and why should we care about that? STEVEN PINKER: I’m using the term specialized sense, not to refer to conventional wisdom or something that is widely known, but to something that is known to be known. That is I know something, you know it. You know that I know it. I know that you know it. You know that I know that you know it, and so on ad infinitum. So, that’s common knowledge in the technical sense. It’s important because it’s necessary for coordination for two or more people to be on the same page to make choices that might be arbitrary, but it works for everyone as long as everyone makes the same choice. Do you stay home on Saturday or Sunday? Do you drive on the right or drive on the left? Now for common knowledge to work, you don’t literally have to think, “I know that she knows it. I know that she knows.” Because your head starts to spin after one or two levels, and technically, common knowledge requires an infinite number of them, which can’t fit inside a single head. But we have a sense of common knowledge when something is conspicuous or self-evident or public or out there. If I see it while I see you seeing it, then I know that you know that I know that you know it. ADI IGNATIUS: So this is the emperor has new clothes. STEVEN PINKER: Well, I begin the book with the story of the emperor’s new clothes because there’s a sense in which it’s a story about common knowledge. When the little boy said the emperor was naked, he wasn’t telling anyone anything they didn’t already know. But he’s changed the state of their knowledge nonetheless because by blurting out what everyone could see within earshot of everyone else, at that moment, everyone knew that everyone else knew that everyone else knew that the emperor was naked. And another point in the book is that just like driving on the right or driving on the left is a solution to a coordination problem or staying home Saturday or staying home Sunday, respecting paper currency, I suggest that our informal social relationships. Are we friends? Do I defer to you? Are we transactional partners? Are we lovers? All of those are matters of common knowledge as well. They’re coordination games and we solidify them by generating some public signal that we both see that inaugurates the relationship. There can be forms of common belief, common misconception, common pretense where you do have assumptions about what other people are thinking and vice versa, that in some cases may not actually be a reality. In the case of a common pretense where we refer to that by saying, “We’re ignoring the elephant in the room,” the metaphor is that an elephant in the room is something you can’t ignore, but we’re pretending to ignore it. Sometimes there is a phenomenon called pluralistic ignorance or a spiral of silence. In economics, it’s sometimes called the Abilene Paradox, where no one actually believes something, but everyone thinks that everyone else believes it, but no one actually does. ADI IGNATIUS: Is there an easy example of that? STEVEN PINKER: Sure. It was originally studied in a fraternity where all the frat guys said privately that it’s really stupid to drink until you puke and pass out. But they said, “What can I do about it? All the other guys think it’s cool.” It turns out none of them thought it was cool, but everyone thought that everyone else thought it was cool. There’ve been many phenomena like that. It turns out that in Saudi Arabia, most of the men think that women should have the right to work and drive, but they couldn’t allow their wives to do it because they mistakenly thought that all the other men thought that it was impermissible. ADI IGNATIUS: So I want to lead this conversation mainly into economic, financial, market areas but your book, I’d say it’s challenging in some ways. There are a lot of brain-teasers, there are a lot of prisoner’s dilemmas, things like that, but it’s also fun. I mean there are a lot of popular references, jokes, cartoons, and then examples. So, one of the things you talk about is the Keynesian beauty contest. Which – and if I get it wrong, you’ll correct me, but where a judge doesn’t simply select the contestant that he or she thinks is the most attractive, but rather is rewarded on selecting based on what he or she thinks the other judges will select, right? STEVEN PINKER: Who are engaged in the same puzzle. ADI IGNATIUS: In the same thing. STEVEN PINKER: They’re guessing what everyone else will judge to be the prettiest face, which is different from the old Miss Rheingold competition where people voted on the prettiest face. In the beauty contest that Keynes hinted might have been in the newspapers in his day, this would be London in the ’20s. No one can ever actually verify whether there really was such of a contest. But it was a great example because for Keynes where he said, “Everyone is trying to out-guess other people out-guessing still other people.” He said, “That’s the way speculative investing works.” They buy the security because they think they can sell it at a higher price to other people who think it’s underpriced, who in turn will want to sell it to still other people. Speculative bubbles, crypto perhaps being one of the most recent examples, are cases where people think that other people in the future will want to buy in, something that’s called the greater fool theory of investing that you invest because you think other people will invest because they think that still other people will invest. The thing is, of course, bubbles can pop when the market starts to run out of the greater fools who think that it’ll continue to appreciate forever. But this can all get started when there is some public signal. In the case of the emperor’s new clothes, the boy blurting it out, or like a public ceremony or a public signal where if there is just a rumor or some reason to think that other people are getting in, that can cause other people to get in. A couple of recent examples are meme stocks where an influencer might talk up a stock even if the fundamentals are terrible, pretty crummy. But the fact that other people know that he’s talking it up and they know that still other people are talking up means that it really can appreciate at least for a while. Two Super Bowls ago, there were a number of high concept ads for crypto exchanges, which mentioned nothing about the advantages of crypto. ADI IGNATIUS: I remember that. These are the Larry David ads. STEVEN PINKER: The Larry David, the Matt Damon, where the point of the ads were everyone’s getting into crypto, don’t be left out. In fact, the punchline to the Larry David comic ad was, “Don’t be like Larry, don’t be left out.” ADI IGNATIUS: So this sounds like a tool that people who understand the psychology could and probably do benefit from, right? STEVEN PINKER: Yes. Getting back to marketing, I talk about an analysis by a political scientist like Michael Chwe, who is in some ways my predecessor in writing a book about common knowledge where he analyzed the most famous and most expensive ad in history. This was the 1984 ad directed by Ridley Scott of Blade Runner and Alien and Fame. It ran exactly once during the 1984 Super Bowl and it was to introduce the Apple Macintosh. It was a revolutionary new product. Unlike those of us who remember the first personal computers, remember it had a little screen with 24 lines of 80 characters and you had to type in alphanumeric commands like del, fubar, fu.bar, and they were error-prone. They were clumsy. So, Apple’s coming out this insanely great new product with windows and menus and icons and a mouse. But they realized that no one would buy it if they thought they were the only one buying it because the price wouldn’t come down because of demand. There wouldn’t be a community of users and experts. So, how do you break the knot and cut the knot and get people to buy something that they’ll only buy if other people are buying it? The answer is the Super Bowl is an annual right in American culture. You know that a lot of people are watching it and you know that a lot of people know that a lot of people are watching it. It is a common knowledge generator. To break the logjam, Apple paid for this ad. It said nothing about the Apple computer, for those of you who have seen it. It played off the fact that it was January 1984, the date of George Orwell’s novel. So, it showed a grim corporate meeting where gray drones trudge into a cavernous hall and listen to drivel from a voice on the screen, intercut with scenes of a live young woman in a bright red gym shorts and a singlet carrying a mallet. She bursts into the corporate meeting, hammer throws the mallet into the screen, which explodes in a fireball revealing the crawl that says on January 25th, Apple will introduce the Macintosh and you’ll see why 1984 won’t be like 1984. Now, the point of the ad was not to advertise the product, it didn’t say anything about the product, but to advertise the audience for the potential buyership. It generated common knowledge. I’m seeing the ad. I know lots of other companies are seeing the ad. What Chwe showed… I mean, it’s a story. How did he prove it? I mean, that’s just a sample of one. So, he looked at other products that only work if enough other people adopt it, products that depend on network effects. Monster.com was one of the first job-seeking ads. Now, why would anyone look for a job on Monster.com unless they thought that lots of employers were posting there? Why would employers post there unless they thought a lot of job seekers were looking for jobs there? Monster.com was introduced at the Super Bowl. Another example is the Discover credit card, which was great credit card, rebates, and high limits, but didn’t matter if you were the only one who had a Discover card because no merchant would accept it and no merchant would accept it unless they thought enough people were going to carry it, introduced in the Super Bowl. Chwe argued that it was another category aside from products that inherently depend on networks, they’re prestige goods that depend on other people that you respect also consuming that product. As far as language, sneakers are sneakers, but for some people, it matters whether they’re the person who wears Nikes or Adidas. An American beer is American beer, but for some people, like being a Bud drinker is just different from being a Coors drinker and products that are consumed in public and where the brand image is important also tend to advertise in the Super Bowl. Crucially, what Chwe showed was not so much that advertisers willing to pay per eyeball, but they’re willing to pay a premium for venues that were common knowledge generators, where it was known that a lot of people were to watch them. They’re willing to pay more per eyeball for products that were consumed in public or that depended on network effects. ADI IGNATIUS: So, maybe the flip side of this phenomenon is the toilet paper shortage during COVID, which was not this, not network effects, but an assumption that I know what you know that I know that you know that. STEVEN PINKER: Well, yes. So, economist named Justin Wolfers speculated that the great COVID toilet paper shortage was like a bank run where people withdraw their money, not necessarily because they think that there’s anything wrong with the bank, but they have heard that other people think there might be something wrong on the sound. They might just have heard that other people think that might be something. That that’s not how it sounds. So, you get this reverberant doubt, and no one wants to be the last customer withdrawing at a point where the bank no longer can cover its deposits. So, people rush to the bank to withdraw their savings, which actually causes the bank to fail, which otherwise it wouldn’t. Likewise, Wolfers suggested that there actually wasn’t a toilet paper shortage. It’s true that people were staying home. So, they were using six packs of Charmin, instead of the big jumbo rolls in their workplace. But Kimberly-Clark quickly stepped up production to meet the demand, but somehow people just know that in an emergency, people hoard toilet paper, which can cause the very shortage that leads people to hoard toilet paper. So, they did hoard toilet paper. A lot of retailers then posted signs, max three rolls per customer. ADI IGNATIUS: That reinforced it. STEVEN PINKER: And that ended the shortage. Not so much because people didn’t strip the shelves because they couldn’t, but they were reassured that since no one else could buy more than three rolls, there was no reason for them to panic. Again, getting back to common knowledge, how did this originate? At least according to one history, it all started with another common knowledge generator, the Tonight Show, which back in the three network era, Johnny Carson was the king of late night. He had not only a huge audience, but people knew that people were watching Johnny Carson, which is why catchphrases from the show like, “Here’s Johnny,” everyone recognized it. So, one night, I think it was 1973, he said, “There’ve been all kinds of shortages lately.” This was an era where there were lines to get gasoline because of the Arab oil embargo and there was a meat shortage and a coffee shortage. He said, “Have you heard the latest? I read it in the papers. There’s a shortage of toilet paper.” Now it turned out it wasn’t true at the time. There was no shortage of toilet paper, but then that created a shortage of toilet paper when everyone ran out to buy it. Since then, at least according to the story, it’s hard to proof, it’s just become conventional wisdom that toilet paper becomes scarce in an emergency. ADI IGNATIUS: All of this must be very valuable for people who are in negotiation, right? Because negotiation is always, “What is it that we both know, and what is it that only I know?” I mean that’s how you win. But yeah, talk about to what extent I know, you know… That’s the fundamental of the people who negotiate better probably understand this concept better. STEVEN PINKER: Yeah. So, negotiation is one of a number of kinds of games in the game theory sense, meaning my best option depends on what you do and vice versa. In any time in which there can be multiple equilibria, cases where everyone is better off if they both do something, but it isn’t preordained what they’ll do. So, the negotiation is what’s sometimes called a battle of the sexes is the technical term. It has nothing actually to do with the sexes, but it refers to a hypothetical couple where they like to spend time together. He would prefer that they go to the hockey game. She would prefer they go to the opera. They’d rather go to either than not do something together. The question is, which one do they go to? Both of them are equilibria. In the case of negotiation, let’s say a car salesman and a buyer. There’s a range of prices in which the salesman makes a profit and the customer pays what they’re willing to pay to get the car. But within that range, the highest the customer is willing to pay, the lowest the seller is willing to sell for, how do they decide? Obviously, the seller wants it as high as possible, the buyer wants it as low as possible. If either of them walks away from the deal, then they’re both worse off. So, how do they decide? So there are many predicaments in life like this where there are many ways of doing something, but both parties are better off if they can figure out some way to do it. In the case of a negotiation, it’s interesting. This is something pointed out many years ago by the political scientist, Thomas Shelley, who won a Nobel Prize for this and other work, that often a buyer and seller in order to find somewhere, anywhere to land on that the other guy will agree with, they’ll pick something like splitting the difference or a round number. He notes that the salesman, who announced that his rock bottom price for the car is $30,007.26, is pretty much pleading to be relieved of $7.26. It’s like, “Oh, come on.” So why a round number? I mean, what’s so special about a round number? What’s special is other people can think it’s special or can expect each other to recognize it as special. So, these points, focal points, sometimes called shelling points, points that pop out in the minds of both parties and that’s all they need to come to an agreement are often where negotiations end up. ADI IGNATIUS: When you talk about common knowledge, particularly some of the early references, it seems a different era than where we are now. Maybe this was never true, but people my age will look back and say, “Well, we used to agree on facts.” We probably didn’t altogether, but we did, right? As you say, there were only three networks that wasn’t this ubiquity of opinion and everything. Now we’re really in an era where they’re competing truths and I would assume competing common knowledges. Obviously, there’s various common knowledges between people and in relationships, but at a larger level, I guess my question is, is that eroding the common knowledge that enables social interaction, et cetera? Is that a concern for you? STEVEN PINKER: There is that fear, although as you say and I often point out that the best explanation for the good old days is a bad memory. There’s a lot of polarization in the ’60s too, riots and terrorist bombings and assassinations and so on. Duly not romanticizing the past, there does seem to be an increase in negative polarization that is not just that people disagree, but each thinks that the other is evil. It’s plausible that one of the contributors was the fragmentation of the media markets. So, that instead of everyone watching Walter Cronkite or Huntley and Brinkley, first with cable news, with Fox News, whose business model was to cultivate a highly partisan audience that wants to hear a certain spin on everything and with social media where the networks of posting and reposting and tweeting and retweeting and linking and relinking has been shown to take place within two or more closed networks with not much interaction between that there could be separate pools of common belief within each of these communities. Something that’s easier to happen when there isn’t one public signal, a Super Bowl, a Johnny Carson, a Walter Cronkite that everyone knows that everyone knows is aware of. ADI IGNATIUS: Okay, so anyway, so this concept of common knowledge existing in different ways in different forms of relationships. So, within a company, if an executive, if a leader wants to create a common knowledge that he or she imagines would be beneficial for the culture of the company, is there a playbook almost for how to create a positive common knowledge within this environment? STEVEN PINKER: Well, in general, common knowledge is generated by something that is conspicuous, public. So, face-to-face meetings can generate common knowledge in a way that, say, remote meetings don’t. That is when you’re in a room, you see everyone else, they see you, they know that they’re seeing each other and seeing the speaker or the leader. So, I think that’s one of the reasons that as with the Super Bowl, which is a broadcast version, but there is an important role for publicly conspicuous notices, sometimes pronouncements. Going back to the economy as a whole, the reason that statements from the Fed are scrutinized and poured over like rabbis parsing the Talmud is that anything that the chairman of the Fed says can create its own reality when people knowing that other people have heard it will act on it out of anticipation of what other people will do, which can then feed on itself and create a bubble, a recession. So, I quote Alan Greenspan, who at one point said, “Since I’ve become chair of the Fed, I’ve learned to mumble with great incoherence. If I seem clear to you, you must have misunderstood what I said.” Because a signal that, say, a recession is ahead will create that recession because companies won’t hire out of fear that they’ll have to lay off employees. Consumers won’t buy out of fear that they might lose their jobs, each of which then creates the reality of the other. So, the chairman of that has to be very, very careful as to what she or he says. ADI IGNATIUS: Yeah. What’s interesting in all of this… You talk about politics in some ways, you talk about authoritarian politics. I lived in China and I lived in Russia and you did have the phenomenon that you described, which is everybody knows that the regime is rotten, but nobody says it because you can’t be certain if you take the streets, there’s going to be anybody else with you, even though everybody knows. Then you understand why you have to control everything because the moment you loosen up anything, it allows for this possibility of communication and understanding. It is like that moment when Ceausescu fell in Romania and he’d controlled everything. Suddenly, there’s people shouting in the back as he’s giving a speech and some stuff’s happening. He realizes it’s over because it’s either complete control or no control. STEVEN PINKER: In particular, since no dictator can control every last member of the population, there just isn’t enough firepower. There aren’t enough informants. As I quote the character of Gandhi in the movie by that name ADI IGNATIUS: Ben Kingsley… STEVEN PINKER: Who at one point tells a British colonial officer, “In the end, you’ll leave because 100,000 Englishmen simply cannot control 350 million Indians if the Indians refuse to cooperate.” He could have said, “Refuse to coordinate or are unable to coordinate.” So people can overpower a regime if they all stand up at the same time, if they all storm the palace, if they all stop work. But how can they do it if each one is afraid that he’ll be the only one? If he stands up, he can be picked off or bundled off to prison. If everyone protests at the same time, then there’s the safety in numbers, but there’s safety in coordination. So, there has to be a way of generating the common knowledge. Now’s the time that we all stand up together. So, protest in a public square where everyone sees everyone else seeing everyone else can often do it, which is why dictators are often terrified of public protests. Or if there is a widely circulated magazine, TV show, radio show, which is why they clamp down on the media. ADI IGNATIUS: Talk about the blank paper. STEVEN PINKER: Oh yeah. So, there’s a joke from the Soviet Union about a man handing out leaflets in red square. Of course, the KGB arrest him. They bundle him off to police headquarters, only discover that the leaflets are blank sheets of paper, and they confront him. They demand, “What is the meaning of this?”, and he says, “What’s there to say? It’s so obvious.” So the point of the joke was he was generating common knowledge. He didn’t need to say anything because people already knew it, but they didn’t know that everyone else knew it. And in a case of life imitating a joke, Putin’s police force has arrested a number of people for carrying blank signs. ADI IGNATIUS: Yeah, well, I wonder if it was before. So, that in China where it’s very dangerous to protest and very dangerous to dissent publicly, after the mishandling of COVID, there were famously blank paper protests. STEVEN PINKER: Oh, interesting. ADI IGNATIUS: Possibly inspired by the original- STEVEN PINKER: Joke. ADI IGNATIUS: … Soviet joke. Yeah. So, the book is fascinating and you put your finger on common knowledge and how we know what we know and how we think about certain things and how we operate. What are we supposed to do with all that? STEVEN PINKER: Well, it’s hard to answer that question because I didn’t write it as a how-to book or as a manual or self-help. It’s a work in fundamental science and logic and philosophy with lots and lots of applications. How you work it out in a particular case often depends on the particular payoffs. What would happen if you fail to coordinate? What do you gain if you do coordinate? If there are multiple ways of coordinating, who gains, who loses? So there’s no single formula, but it is a lens with which to view the world simply because coordination is so ubiquitous in human affairs. Any corporation, any institution, any school, any relationship, any couple, any friendship, any family, these are all people trying to coordinate and they always have to coordinate with some signal of common knowledge. They often, in order to preserve the relationship, have to keep things out of common knowledge. So, all the phenomena of politeness, euphemism, innuendo, tact, pretending not to see the elephant in the room, beating around the bush, hypocrisy, genteel hypocrisy, all of those I consider to be cases where people privately know something, but there’s some reason to keep it out of common knowledge. The reason being something in common knowledge changes the relationship. Sometimes you don’t want to change the relationship or you don’t want to signal the wrong relationship. So, just to give a couple of examples, I mean the most common case of systematic hypocrisy is politeness. If you could pass the salt, that would be awesome. What? If you think about it, literally, it really doesn’t make a whole lot of sense. But could you pass the salt? Do you think you might pass the salt? Why do we go through those rituals? It’s because we don’t want to boss each other around. I don’t want to give you a command as if you’re the butler, assuming that we’re friends or for that matter, strangers. ADI IGNATIUS: So benign hypocrisy or some of these protocols, they may not be direct, they may not be honest, but they’re what we need to function. STEVEN PINKER: They’re what we need to preserve our relationships because our relationships are coordination games, which depend on common knowledge. Sometimes we don’t want to blow up a relationship. So, we avoid the common knowledge. ADI IGNATIUS:. Steven Pinker, thank you for being on IdeaCast. STEVEN PINKER: Thanks for having me.

Meta brought the smarts of Oakley Meta HSTN to Ray-Ban styles. Here's what's new compared to the first-gen pair. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Same looks, new features Higher-quality 3K video recording and double the battery life highlight the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 upgrades over the original model. It's available in the same Wayfarer, Headliner, and Skyler styles and prescription lenses are available within the supported range. A classic with limits Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 1) was the breakthrough follow-up to Ray-Ban Stories, and it has sold millions. There's a reason for that — these are great smart glasses, but they also come with notable limitations, including battery life and camera quality. Ray-Ban Meta became the first product to make smart glasses mainstream, selling over two million units since their debut in 2023. Now, Meta is here with a second-generation version of the three iconic Ray-Ban smart glasses styles, packing revamped hardware. The recent Oakley Meta HSTN launch brought extra battery life and crisper video recording to Meta smart glasses, and now those advancements are headed to Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2. Meta is continuing to sell the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 at a lower price than the Gen 2 smart glasses, creating an interesting dilemma for interested buyers. Should owners of the Gen 1 smart glasses upgrade to the Gen 2 revision, and should new buyers pay more for the extra features? Those are the questions we'll help you answer in this comparison between Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 and Gen 2. Let's dive in. Why you can trust Android Central Our expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test. Meta revealed the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 smart glasses at Connect 2025. They are available now online and at partner retailers for $379. They're sold in the same Wayfarer, Skyler, and Headliner styles as the first-generation smart glasses, but there are a few limited-edition colorways for early adopters. The same range of prescription lenses is supported, too, with prescriptions between -6.00 and +4.00 being compatible. The Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 smart glasses are sticking around at a $299 price point, but some styles are out of stock. Skyler and Wayfarer styles appear to be available, although it's unclear for how long or if stock will be replenished. You can equip them with prescriptions between -6.00 and +4.00, just like Gen 2. For those with advanced prescription needs, there are third-party workarounds available. Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 are identical to the first-generation pair of smart glasses from a design standpoint. You can choose between Wayfarer, Skyler, or Headliner styles depending on which you prefer, but these frames will look virtually identical across the Gen 1 and Gen 2 models. You get a camera on one side of the frames for photos and video recording, plus an LED indicator light on the opposite side to let others know when you're capturing content. The big change to the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2's design and dimensions is that Meta managed to shave a few grams of weight off the frames. The new pair of smart glasses weighs 48 grams, down from 52 grams on the Gen 1 model. I had comfort issues with Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 at times, partially due to the weight, which caused the glasses to slip down the bridge of my nose at times. I don't know whether the four-gram difference in weight will make the Gen 2 noticeably more comfortable, but I don't think it can hurt either. Category Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 1) Styles Wayfarer, Headliner, Skyler Wayfarer, Skyler, Headliner (out of stock) Lenses Polarized, Transitions, prescription (-6.0 to +4.0) Polarized, Transitions, prescription (-6.0 to +4.0) Camera 12MP Ultra-Wide 12MP Ultra-Wide Photo resolution 3024 X 4032 pixels (Portrait only) 3024 X 4032 pixels (Portrait default) Video resolution 1200p at 60FPS 1440p at 30FPS 3K at 30FPS 1440 x 1920 pixels at 30 fps (Vertical default) Speakers 2X open ear speakers 2X open ear speakers Microphones Custom 5-mic Array (2 in left arm, 2 in right arm, 1 near nose pad) Custom 5-mic Array (2 in left arm, 2 in right arm, 1 near nose pad) Storage 32GB; about 500 photos, 100 30-second videos 32GB; about 100+ videos (30 sec) and 500+ photos (3 frame burst) Connectivity Wi-Fi 6; Bluetooth 5.3 Wi-Fi 6; Bluetooth 5.3 Compatibility iOS; Android iOS; Android Weight 52g 49.2g Durability IPX4 IPX4 Battery Up to 8 hours per charge 5 hours continuous audio playback or voice calling 4 hours per charge: 30 minutes live streaming Charging (glasses) case 48 hours worth of charge Up to 32 hours Charging speed 50% in 20 minutes 50% in 20 minutes Both the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 and Gen 2 smart glasses offer a 12MP ultra-wide camera, with support for 3024 X 4032 resolution photos. However, the video-recording capabilities of the Gen 2 pair are vastly superior to the Gen 1 model. You get 1200p at 60FPS, 1440p at 30FPS, and 3K at 30FPS video recording on the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2, and that exceeds the 1080p maximum on the Gen 1 glasses. It's the same 3K camera we saw on Oakley Meta HSTN, which should bring more advanced stabilization while recording video, particularly handy for action shots. Hyperlapse and slow-motion video recording is heading to Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 in a future software update this fall, according to Meta. Whether you need the extra resolution and video recording features will depend on whether you're satisfied with your current Gen 1 pair. Those who love recording video while running or working out will likely benefit from the extra frame rate support and stabilization of the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 camera. Both the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 and Gen 2 smart glasses have open-air speakers for video calls, audio playback, and more. There's also built-in microphones for audio input. Battery life was the most obvious place for Meta to upgrade its Ray-Ban smart glasses, and the second-generation model doesn't disappoint in this area. Just like the Meta Oakley HSTN smart glasses, the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 glasses can last up to eight hours on a single charge. That's double the four-hour battery life of the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 smart glasses. In the real world, that means you can take more photos, record more videos, and listen to more audio without needing to pop the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 into their charging case. In fact, the new model nets you five hours of continuous audio playback or voice calling. Both the Gen 1 and Gen 2 smart glasses can charge up to 50% in 20 minutes in a pinch. You charge both pairs of smart glasses by popping them into an included charging case, which has its own internal battery and a USB-C port. The case is also used for pairing with the Meta AI companion app and has a button for connections and resets. Meta AI is becoming more robust, supporting voice assistance and camera inputs. Essentially, it's a multimodal AI service that can take in audio plus your surroundings to help answer questions and take actions on your behalf. Both generations of Ray-Ban Meta support Meta AI, but there are extra features on the Gen 2 revision, like better live translation support. The ability for offline translation is also said to be coming in a future update. If you're in the market for a new pair of Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, the choice is easy. The second-generation Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses clear the originals in weight, camera quality, and battery life — all key areas. As such, paying the extra $80 for the Gen 2 is a no-brainer when you consider all the quality-of-life upgrades you'll get. You should consider whether Ray-Ban Meta Display, Oakley Meta HSTN, or Oakley Meta Vanguard might suit you better if you have specialized use cases, like the need for a display or fitness-focused glasses. However, those with the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 smart glasses shouldn't feel the pressure to upgrade immediately. If the camera quality and battery life are meeting your expectations, hold onto them. The experience between models is largely the same, you'll just need to charge your Gen 1 pair more frequently. The one to buy Meta addressed the major drawbacks of Ray-Ban Meta Gen 1 with the second-generation revision, and they only cost a bit more. For that extra cash, you get excellent 3K video with better stabilization and double the battery life of the original. It's a no-brainer for people in the market for new smart glasses. Worth holding onto Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 1) are still a great set of smart glasses, so current owners might need to upgrade if the battery life is not meeting their needs. It could also be a neat value purchase if you want to save a few bucks compared to the Gen 2 version.

Title: The YouTube Tip of the Google Spear

Stratechery Plus Learn MoreMember Forum Stratechery Plus Learn MoreMember Forum Latest Podcast Listen to Podcast Listen to this post: Action is happening up-and-down the LLM stack: Nvidia is making deals with Intel, OpenAI is making deals with Oracle, and Nvidia and OpenAI are making deals with each other. Nine years after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang hand-delivered the first Nvidia DGX-1 AI computer to OpenAI, the chip giant is investing up to $100 billion in the AI lab, which OpenAI will, of course, spend on Nvidia AI systems. This ouroboros of a deal certainly does feel a bit frothy, but there is a certain logic to it: Nvidia is uniquely dominant in AI thanks to the company’s multi-year investment in not just superior chips but also an entire ecosystem from networking to software, and has the cash flow and stock price befitting its position in the AI value chain. Doing a deal like this at this point in time not only secures the company’s largest customer — and rumored ASIC maker — but also gives Nvidia equity upside beyond the number of chips it can manufacture. More broadly, lots of public investors would like the chance to invest in OpenAI; I don’t think Nvidia’s public market investors are bothered to have now acquired that stake indirectly. The interconnectedness of these investments reflects the interconnectedness of the OpenAI and Nvidia stories in particular: Huang may have delivered OpenAI their first AI computer, but it was OpenAI that delivered Nvidia the catalyst for becoming the most valuable company in the world, with the November 2022 launch of ChatGPT. Ever since, the assumption of many in tech has been that the consumer market in particular has been OpenAI’s to lose, or perhaps more accurately, monetize; no company has ever grown faster in terms of users and revenue, and that’s before they had an advertising model! And beyond the numbers, have you used ChatGPT? It’s so useful. You can look up information, or format text, and best of all you can code! Of course there are other models like Anthropic’s Claude, which has excelled at coding in particular, but surely the sheer usefulness makes ultimate success inevitable! If a lot of those takes sound familiar, it’s because I’ve made some version of most of them; I also, perhaps relatedly, took to Twitter like a fish to water. Just imagine, an app that was the nearly perfect mixture of content I was interested in and people I wanted to hear from, and interact with. Best of all it was text: the efficiency of information acquisition was unmatched, and it was just as easy to say my piece. It took me much longer to warm up to Facebook, and, frankly, I never was much of a user; I’ve never been one to image dump episodes of my life, nor have I had much inclination to wade through others’. I wasn’t interested in party photos; I lusted after ideas and arguments, and Twitter — a view shared by much of both tech and media — was much more up my alley. Despite that personal predilection, however, and perhaps because of my background in small town Wisconsin and subsequently living abroad, I retained a strong sense of the importance of Facebook. Sure, the people who I was most interested in hearing from and interacting with may have been the types to leave their friends and family for the big city, but for most people, friends and family were the entire point of life generally, and by extension, social media specifically. To that end, I was convinced from the beginning that Facebook was going to be a huge deal, and argued so multiple times on Stratechery; social media was ultimately a matter of network effects and scale, and Facebook was clearly on the path to domination, even as much of the Twitterati were convinced the company was the next MySpace. I was similarly bullish about Instagram: no, I wasn’t one to post a lot of personal pictures, but while I personally loved text, most people liked photos. What people really liked most of all, however — and not even Facebook saw this coming — was video. TikTok grew into a behemoth with the insight that social media was only ever a stepping stone to personal entertainment, of which video was the pinnacle. There were no network effects of the sort that everyone — including regulators — assumed would lead to eternal Facebook dominance; rather, TikTok realized that Paul Krugman’s infamous dismissal of the Internet actually was somewhat right: most people actually don’t have anything to say that is particularly compelling, which means that limiting the content you see to your social network dramatically decreases the possibility you’ll be entertained every time you open your social networking app. TikTok dispensed with this artificial limitation, simply showing you compelling videos period, no matter where they came from. Of course TikTok wasn’t the first company to figure this out: YouTube was the first video platform, and from the beginning focused on building an algorithm that focused more on giving you videos you were interested in than in showing you what you claimed to want to see. YouTube, however, was and probably always has been my biggest blind spot: I’m just not a big video watcher in general, and YouTube seemed like more work than short-form video, which married the most compelling medium with the most addictive delivery method — the feed. Sure, YouTube was a great acquisition for Google — certainly in line with the charge to “organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful” — but I — and Google’s moneymaker, Search — was much more interested in text, and pictures if I must. The truth, however, is that YouTube has long been the giant hiding in plain sight: the service is the number one streaming service in the living room — bigger than Netflix — and that’s the company’s 3rd screen after mobile and the PC, where it has no peer. More than that, YouTube is not just the center of culture, but the nurturer of it: the company just announced that it has paid out more than $100 billion to creators over the last four years; given that many creators earn more from brand deals than they do from YouTube ads, that actually understates the size of the YouTube economy. Yes, TikTok is a big deal, but TikTok stars hope to make it on YouTube, where they can actually make a living. And yet, YouTube sometimes seems like an afterthought, at least to people like me and others immersed in the text-based Internet. Last week I was in New York for YouTube’s annual “Made on YouTube” event, but the night before I couldn’t remember the name; I turned to Google, natch, and couldn’t figure it out. The reason is that talk about YouTube mostly happens on YouTube; I, and Google itself, still live in a text-based world. That is the world that was rocked by ChatGPT, especially Google. The company’s February 2023 introduction of Bard in Paris remains one of the most surreal keynotes I’ve ever watched: most of the content was rehashed, the presenters talked as if they were seeing their slides for the first time, and one of the demos of a phone-based feature neglected to remember to have a phone on hand. This was a company facing a frontal assault on their most obvious and profitable area of dominance — text-based information retrieval — and they were completely flat-footed. Google has, in the intervening years, made tremendous strides to come back, including dumping the Bard name in favor of Gemini, itself based on vastly improved underlying models. I’m also impressed by how the company has incorporated AI into search; not only are AI Overviews generally useful, they’re also incredibly fast, and as a bonus have the links I sometimes prefer already at hand. Ironically, however, you could make the case that the biggest impact LLMs have had on Search is giving a federal judge an excuse to let Google continue paying its biggest would-be competitors (like Apple) to simply offer their customers Google instead. The biggest reason to be skeptical of the company’s fortunes in AI is that they had the most to lose; the company is doing an excellent job of minimizing the losses. What I would submit, however, is that Google’s most important and most compelling AI announcements actually don’t have anything to do with Search, at least not yet. These announcements start, as you might expect, with Google’s Deep Mind Research Lab; where they hit the real world, however, is on YouTube — and that, like the user-generated streaming service, is a really big deal. A perfect example of the DeepMind-to-YouTube pipeline was last week’s announcement of Veo 3-based features for making YouTube Shorts. From the company’s blog post: We’ve partnered with Google DeepMind to bring a custom version of their most powerful video generation model, Veo 3, to YouTube. Veo 3 Fast is designed to work seamlessly in YouTube Shorts for millions of creators and users, for free. It generates outputs with lower latency at 480p so you can easily create video clips – and for the first time, with sound – from any idea, all from your phone. This initial launch will allow you to not only generate videos, but also use one video to animate another (or a photo), stylize your video with a single touch, and add objects. You can also create an entire video — complete with voiceover — from a collection of clips, or convert speech to song. All of these features are a bit silly, but, well, that’s often where genius — or at least virality — comes from. Critics, of course, will label this an AI slop machine, and they’ll be right! The vast majority of content created by these tools will be boring and unwatched. That, however, is already the case with YouTube: the service sees 500 hours of content uploaded every minute, and most of that content isn’t interesting to anyone; the magic of YouTube, however, is the algorithm that finds out what is actually compelling and spreads it to an audience that wants exactly that. To put it another way, for YouTube AI slop is a strategy credit: given that the service has already mastered organizing overwhelming amounts of content and only surfacing what is good, it, more than anyone else, can handle exponentially more content which, through the sheer force of numbers, will result in an absolute increase of content that is actually compelling. That’s not the only strategy credit YouTube has; while the cost of producing AI-generated video will likely be lower than the cost of producing human-generated video, at least in the long run, the latter’s costs are not borne by TikTok or Meta (Facebook and Instagram are basically video platforms at this point). Rather, the brilliance of the user-generated content model is that creators post their content for free! This, however, means that AI-generated video is actually more expensive, at least if it’s made on TikTok or Meta’s servers. YouTube, however, pays its creators, which means that for the service AI-generated video actually has the potential to lower costs in the long run, increasing the incentive to leverage DeepMind’s industry-leading models. In short, while everyone immediately saw how AI could be disruptive to Search, AI is very much a sustaining innovation for YouTube: it increases the amount of compelling content in absolute terms, and it does so with better margins, at least in the long run. Here’s the million billion trillion dollar question: what is going to matter more in the long run, text or video? Sure, Google would like to dominate everything, but if it had to choose, is it better to dominate video or dominate text? The history of social networking that I documented above suggests that video is, in the long run, much more compelling to many more people. To put it another way, the things that people in tech and media are interested in has not historically been aligned with what actually makes for the largest service or makes the most money: people like me, or those reading me, care about text and ideas; the services that matter specialize in videos and entertainment, and to the extent that AI matters for the latter YouTube is primed to be the biggest winner, even as the same people who couldn’t understand why Twitter didn’t measure up to Facebook go ga-ga over text generation and coding capabilities. The potential impact of AI on YouTube’s fortunes isn’t just about AI-created videos; rather, the most important announcement of last week’s event was the first indicator that AI can massively increase the monetization potential of every video on the streaming service. You might have missed the announcement, because YouTube underplayed it; from their event blog post: We’re adding updates to brand deals and Shopping to make brand collaborations easier than ever. We’re accelerating these deals through a new initiative and new product features to make sure those partnerships succeed – like the ability to add a link to a brand’s site in Shorts. And YouTube Shopping is expanding to more markets and merchants and getting help from AI to make tagging easier. It’s just half a sentence — “getting help from AI to make tagging easier” — but the implications of those eight words are profound; here’s how YouTube explained the feature: We know tagging products can be time-consuming, so to make the experience better for creators, we’re leaning on an AI-powered system to identify the optimal moment a product is mentioned and automatically display the product tag at that time, capturing viewer interest when it’s highest. We’ll also begin testing the ability to automatically identify and tag all eligible products mentioned in your video later this year. The creator who demonstrated the feature — that right there is a great example of how YouTube is a different world than the one I and other people in the media inhabit — was very enthusiastic about the reduction in hassle and time-savings that would come from using AI to do a menial task like tagging sponsored products; that sounds like AI at its best, freeing up creative people to do what they do best. There’s no reason, however, why auto-tagging can’t become something much greater; in fact, I already explained the implications of this exact technology in explaining why AI made me bullish on Meta: This leads to a third medium-term AI-derived benefit that Meta will enjoy: at some point ads will be indistinguishable from content. You can already see the outlines of that given I’ve discussed both generative ads and generative content; they’re the same thing! That image that is personalized to you just might happen to include a sweater or a belt that Meta knows you probably want; simply click-to-buy. It’s not just generative content, though: AI can figure out what is in other content, including authentic photos and videos. Suddenly every item in that influencer photo can be labeled and linked — provided the supplier bought into the black box, of course — making not just every piece of generative AI a potential ad, but every piece of content period. The market implications of this are profound. One of the oddities of analyzing digital ad platforms is that some of the most important indicators are counterintuitive; I wrote this spring: The most optimistic time for Meta’s advertising business is, counter-intuitively, when the price-per-ad is dropping, because that means that impressions are increasing. This means that Meta is creating new long-term revenue opportunities, even as its ads become cost competitive with more of its competitors; it’s also notable that this is the point when previous investor freak-outs have happened. When I wrote that I was, as I noted in the introduction, feeling more cautious about Meta’s business, given that Reels is built out and the inventory opportunities of Meta AI were not immediately obvious. I realize now, though, that I was distracted by Meta AI: the real impact of AI is to make everything inventory, which is to say that the price-per-ad on Meta will approach $0 for basically forever. Would-be competitors are finding it difficult enough to compete with Meta’s userbase and resources in a probabilisitic world; to do so with basically zero price umbrella seems all-but-impossible. This analysis was spot-on; I just pointed it at the wrong company. This opportunity to leverage AI to make basically every pixel monetizable absolutely exists for Meta; Meta, however, has to actually develop the models and infrastructure to do it at scale. Google is already there; it was the company universally decried for being slow-moving that announced the first version of this feature last week. I can’t overstate what a massive opportunity this is: every item in every YouTube video is well on its way to being a monetizable surface. Yes, that may sound dystopian when I put it so baldly, but if you think about it you can see the benefits; I’ve been watching a lot of home improvement videos lately, and it sure would be useful to be able to not just identify but helpfully have a link to buy a lot of the equipment I see, much of which is basically in the background because it’s not the point of the video. It won’t be long until YouTube has that inventory, which it could surface with an affiliate fee link, or make biddable for companies who want to reach primed customers. More generally, you can actually envision Google pulling this off: the company may have gotten off to a horrible start in the chatbot era, but the company has pulled itself together and is increasingly bringing its model and infrastructure leadership to bear, even as Meta has had to completely overhaul their AI approach after hitting a wall. I’m sure CEO Mark Zuckerberg will figure it out, but Google — surprise! — is the company actually shipping. Or, rather, YouTube is. Close readers of Stratechery have been observing — and probably, deservedly, smirking — at this most unexpected evolution: I am enjoying @benthompson’s journey to becoming a $GOOGL bull pic.twitter.com/xryDBIukRW That quote is from Paradigm Shifts and the Winner’s Curse, an Article that was mostly about my concerns about Apple and Amazon, and reads: And, by the same token, I’m much more appreciative of Google’s amorphous nature and seeming lack of strategy. That makes them hard to analyze — again, I’ve been honest for years about the challenges I find in understanding Mountain View — but the company successfully navigated one paradigm shift, and is doing much better than I originally expected with this one. Larry Page and Sergey Brin famously weren’t particularly interested in business or in running a company; they just wanted to do cool things with computers in a college-like environment like they had at Stanford. That the company, nearly thirty years later, is still doing cool things with computers in a college-like environment may be maddening to analysts like me who want clarity and efficiency; it also may be the key to not just surviving but winning across multiple paradigms. Appreciating the benefits of Google being an amorphous blob where no one knows what is going on, least of all leadership, is a big part of my evolution; this Article is the second part: that blob ultimately needs a way to manifest the technology it manages to come up with, and if you were to distill my worries about Google in the age of AI it would be to wonder how the company could become an answer machine — which Page and Brin always wanted — when it risked losing the massive economic benefits that came from empowering users to choose the winners of auctions Google conducted for advertisers. That, however, is ultimately the text-based world, and there’s a case to be made that, in the long run, it simply won’t matter as much as the world of video. Again, the company is doing better with Search than I expected, and I’ve always been bullish about the impact of AI on the company’s cloud business; the piece I’ve missed, however, is that Google already has the tip of the spear for its AI excellence to actually go supernova: YouTube, the hidden giant in plain sight, a business that is simultaneously unfathomably large, and also just getting started.

Title: Google faces antitrust déjà vu as US seeks to break up its digital advertising business

After deflecting the U.S. Justice Department’s attack on its illegal monopoly in online search, Google is facing another attempt to dismantle its internet empire in a trial focused on its abusive tactics in digital advertising. The trial that opened Monday in an Alexandria, Virginia, federal court revolves around the harmful conduct that resulted in U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema declaring parts of Google’s digital advertising technology to be an illegal monopoly. The judge found that Google has been engaging in behavior that stifles competition to the detriment of online publishers that depend on the system for revenue. Google and the Justice Department will spend the next two weeks in court presenting evidence in a “remedy” trial that will culminate in Brinkema issuing a ruling on how to restore fair market conditions. “The purpose of a remedy is doing what is necessary to restore competition,” said Julia Tarver Wood in an opening statement for the DOJ’s antitrust division. Wood said that the Google is manipulating the market in a way that is antithetical to free market competition. “The means to cheat are buried in computer codes and algorithms,” Wood said. An attorney for Google, Karen Dunn, countered that the remedy proposed by the government is reckless and radical, and that the DOJ is attempting to remove Google entirely from the competition. No matter how the judge rules, Google says it will appeal the earlier decision labeling the ad network as a monopoly. Appeals can’t be filed until the remedy is determined. The case, filed in 2023 under President Joe Biden’s administration, threatens the complex network that Google has spent the past 17 years building to power its dominant digital advertising business. Besides accounting for most of the $305 billion in revenue that Google’s services division generates for its corporate parent Alphabet Inc., digital advertising sales provide the lifeblood that keeps thousands of websites alive. If the Justice Department gets its way, Brinkema will order Google to sell parts of its ad technology — a proposal that the company’s lawyers warned would “invite disruption and damage” to consumers and the internet’s ecosystem. The Justice Department contends a breakup would be the most effective and quickest way to undercut a monopoly that has been stifling competition and innovation for years. Google believes it has already made enough changes to its “Ad Manager” system, including providing more options and pricing options, to resolve the issues the Brinkema flagged in her monopoly ruling., The legal battle over Google’s advertising technology mirrors another showdown that the company recently navigated after another federal judge condemned its dominant search engine as an illegal monopoly and then held remedy hearings earlier this year to consider how to stop the misconduct. In that case, the Justice Department also proposed a severe crackdown that would have required Google to sell its popular Chrome browser, but U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta decided a less dramatic shake-up was needed amid a search market being reshaped by artificial intelligence technology in a decision issued earlier this month. Even though Google didn’t agree with all aspects of Mehta’s decision, the ruling was widely seen as a slap on the wrist — a sentiment that has helped propel Alphabet’s stock price to new highs. The 20% gain since Mehta’s decision helped make Alphabet only the fourth publicly traded company to reach a market value of $3 trillion — an increase of more than $1 trillion since Brinkema branded Google’s ad technology as a monopoly in April. In an indication that the outcome of the search monopoly case might sway things in the advertising technology proceedings, Brinkema asked both Google and the Justice Department to address Mehta’s decision during the upcoming trial. As they did in the search case, Google’s lawyers already have been asserting in court papers that AI technology being used by ad network rivals like Meta Platforms is reshaping the way the market works and overriding the need for the Justice Department’s “radical” proposals. The Justice Department is “fighting for a remedy that would vanquish a past that has been overtaken by technological and market transformations in the way digital ads are consumed,” Google’s lawyers argued leading up to the trial. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Shares of a semiconductor testing company rose Monday after an analyst highlighted strong demand trends and collaboration with a major chip-industry player. Meanwhile, reports of an impending product safety announcement dragged down shares of a consumer health firm. Major U.S. equities indexes moved higher as plans by Nvidia (NVDA) to invest up to $100 million in ChatGPT maker OpenAI reinvigorated optimism around artificial intelligence. The S&P 500 added 0.4%, extending its streak of all-time closing highs to three consecutive sessions. The Dow ticked 0.1% higher, while the Nasdaq jumped 0.7%, with both setting their own fresh closing records. Shares of Nvidia finished 4% higher. Read Investopedia's full coverage of today's trading here. The day's top performance in the S&P 500 belonged to shares of semiconductor equipment maker Teradyne (TER), which surged 13%. Susquehanna Financial boosted its price target on Teradyne stock, with its analysts saying the provider of automated test equipment for semiconductors and robotic systems could benefit from strong demand trends over the coming years and highlighting Teradyne's increasing partnership with chip industry giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM). White House officials confirmed that Oracle (ORCL) is part of a consortium set to control the U.S. operations of the social media platform TikTok. Oracle also announced that Clay Magouyrk, current president of cloud infrastructure, and Mike Sicilia, president of industries, will take the reins of the enterprise software giant as co-CEOs. Current CEO Safra Catz will remain with Oracle as the executive vice chair of its board, while co-founder Larry Ellison will maintain his role as chief technology officer and board chair. Oracle shares jumped 6.3%. Moderna (MRNA) shares gained 5.2% after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine panel voted on updated recommendations related to COVID shots. While the CDC's Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices removed guidance calling for all people to be vaccinated against COVID and now recommends that patients consult with their doctor before receiving the shot, the panel opted not to require patients to obtain a prescription for the vaccine. Shares of Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies (WAB), a provider of equipment for freight and passenger railway systems, added 4.9%. The company also known as Wabtec announced a deal worth more than $4 billion to deliver 300 of its Evolution Series locomotives to Kazakhstan's national railway company over the coming decade and provide long-term service support. Citi analysts initiated coverage on Wabco stock with a "buy" rating, suggesting the company could benefit from increasing infrastructure investment as well as moves by railroad operators to renew and expand their fleets. Shares of Tylenol maker Kenvue (KVUE) dropped 7.5%, the most of any S&P 500 stock, following reports that the Trump administration planned to make an announcement linking use of the painkiller during pregnancy to autism. A presentation on the matter happened at the White House after the closing bell. Kenvue, the consumer health company that spun off from Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) in 2023, said that scientific studies show no link between acetaminophen and autism. Social media giant Meta Platforms (META) launched a pair of new features for its Facebook Dating service—an AI assistant that provides support throughout the dating process and a function that offers automatic matches with potential partners based on Facebook's algorithms. Shares of Match Group (MTCH), operator of Tinder, Hinge, and other dating platforms, fell 5.4%. Lennar (LEN) shares fell 4.3% on Monday, extending losses posted Friday after the homebuilder missed quarterly sales and profit forecasts. Following the softer-than-expected earnings results, Raymond James downgraded Lennar stock to "underperform" from "market perform." Analysts suggested that Lennar's margins could remain under pressure, citing the company's use of selling incentives to attract buyers and its elevated on technology and teams.

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Staff Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us Meta announced on Monday that it’s bringing an AI assistant to Facebook Dating. This chatbot is intended to help users find matches who are more closely tailored to what they are looking for. For example, Meta might suggest users ask it to find “a Brooklyn girl in tech,” or a user could ask the AI to help refine their profile. Meta also says that it’s “helping people avoid swipe fatigue” with a new feature called Meet Cute, which gives users a weekly “surprise match” chosen based on its algorithm. The company says Facebook Dating matches among adults ages 18 to 29 have increased 10% year-over-year, with hundreds of thousands of users in that age group creating Facebook Dating profiles each month. That’s small compared to competitors like Tinder, which has about 50 million daily active users, and Hinge’s 10 million daily active users. AI features have already become the norm in mainstream dating apps. Even newer dating apps like Sitch have attempted to differentiate themselves with their AI features. Match Group — the owner of Tinder, Hinge, OKCupid, and others — entered a partnership with OpenAI last year, which is part of the dating giant’s $20 million-plus investment in AI. That’s a big bet, especially given the financial struggles of Match Group, which has lost about 68% of its stock price in the last five years. So far, this investment has produced features like an AI photo selector tool for Tinder, which scans your camera roll to help choose profile images, as well as AI-powered matching. Hinge has a feature that lets users improve their responses to profile prompts with AI. Bumble has added similar AI features, and founder Whitney Wolfe Herd even ruffled some feathers last year when she suggested that one day, users could have personal “AI concierges” that go on dates with other people’s AI to determine compatibility.

Food insecurity and agriculture in South Asia, including Bangladesh, pose significant threats to the well-being and livelihoods of its people. Building adaptive capacities and resilient food systems is crucial for sustainable livelihoods. This study employs the Resilience Index Measurement and Analysis II framework to construct a Resilience Capacity Index (RCI) and analyze its relationship with food security using data from the Bangladesh Integrated Household Survey 2018. The study applies Exploratory Factor Analysis and Structural Equation Modeling to examine the impact of key resilience components such as Access to Basic Services, Adaptive Capacity, and Assets on household resilience. The findings reveal that access to basic services, land assets, and farm equipment positively influences households’ resilience capacity. However, the presence of livestock assets has a negative impact, potentially due to market volatility, climate vulnerability, and disease outbreaks. Additionally, adaptive capacity has a positive but insignificant influence on RCI, suggesting that without enhancing economic opportunities, institutional support, and inclusive development strategies, adaptive capacity could not be enough to foster resilience. However, resilient capacity enhances food security metrics such as the Food Consumption Score and Expenditure. These findings underscore the importance of policies that focus on increasing and maintaining access to basic services, promoting sustainable land management practices, and strengthening social safety nets. This study emphasizes the importance of focusing on livestock assets to ensure their sustainability by stabilizing the livestock market, improving veterinary services, and providing subsidies to reduce maintenance costs.

Food consumption is a fundamental human need, and a global concern, characterized by a surplus of food in some regions and scarcity in others. It stands as a cornerstone of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), notably SDG-1 (No Hunger) [1]. Achieving food security, which ensures an end to hunger, is essential for human well-being [2]. According to the World Food Summit, food security entails access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food [3]. However, food security is a multifaceted issue intertwined with trade, politics, history, health and nutrition [4]. Countries reliant on imports are often vulnerable to fluctuations in the global market, as international trade can directly affect food accessibility and price stability [5,6]. Political instability and conflict can severely disrupt food production and distribution systems, as observed in countries like Somalia and Yemen [7]. Food systems and access continue to be shaped by historical legacies of colonialism and unequal land distribution, particularly in many developing countries [8]. Moreover, malnutrition exacerbates health vulnerabilities, while poor health undermines households’ capacity to produce or procure food, creating a cyclical relationship [9,10]. Achieving food security, therefore, requires nutrition-sensitive systems that go beyond meeting calorie needs to ensure dietary diversity and adequate nutrient intake [11,12]. Food insecurity, on the other hand, refers to limited or uncertain access to adequate and nutritious food, and the inability to obtain food in socially acceptable ways [13]. It represents a complex challenge that affects individuals and communities worldwide. Many developing countries, including Bangladesh, have recently experienced acute food insecurity. According to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), a collaborative initiative involving governments, non-governmental organizations, UN Agencies, civil society and other relevant actors, approximately 9.14 million individuals, or 20% of the population, are categorized in Phases 3 and 4 [14]. These phases indicate high levels of acute food insecurity in certain parts of Bangladesh. The poorest households in these areas face significant challenges exacerbated by factors such as high inflation, reduced earnings, and frequent climate-related shocks, which contribute to the severity of food insecurity among the population [14]. The frequency and intensity of natural, economic, and political hazards affecting individuals, businesses, economies, and even entire nations are increasing [15–19]. The concept of resilience has thus gained prominence in governmental and research contexts. Initially introduced in ecology literature by Holling [20], resilience has since been studied and applied across various fields, including socioeconomics [21]. Resilience is commonly defined as the capacity to anticipate, prepare for, respond to, and recover from shocks efficiently and effectively [22]. Recent studies have expanded this definition to include the ability to manage persistent risk exposure [23]. In the context of food security analysis, resilience refers to the latent capacity of households to withstand and navigate socioeconomic factors, climate variability, and other shocks [24]. Traditionally viewed as an endpoint, resilience is now understood as a continuous process that can either enhance or diminish response capacities, thereby impacting overall well-being [25]. Resilient food systems are adept at adapting to new conditions while maintaining stable food production and ensuring access for vulnerable populations. They mitigate the impact of shocks and stressors, with social and economic factors playing crucial roles in enhancing resilience. In countries like Bangladesh, where a significant portion of the population relies on agriculture, food insecurity remains a pressing concern. The food system is vulnerable due to its heavy reliance on a few staple crops such as rice, wheat, and maize, and its interconnectedness with the global food supply chain [14,26–28]. Disruptions in one part of the system can lead to cascading effects throughout. Moreover, the lack of agricultural diversity and reliance on intensive monoculture practices increase vulnerability to pests, diseases, and climate shocks. Bangladesh is particularly susceptible to extreme weather events such as heat waves, floods and droughts [29], which can severely impact food production and access [30]. Assessing the resilience of communities and households to shocks and threats is crucial as it allows nations to anticipate and effectively address these challenges. Resilience assessments help policymakers and organisations understand how well a community can rebound from adversity. Food security, with its multifaceted and complex nature, has predominantly been studied through vulnerability assessments. However, the methodologies used in these assessments often lack dynamism, which makes precise predictions of potential shocks and incidents challenging [31–33]. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) developed the Resilience Index Measurement Analysis (RIMA) to quantify resilience [6,34,35]. This method introduces the concept that resilience can be estimated as a latent variable through a two-step procedure involving observable factors, even when resilience itself is not immediately observable [33]. Recent advancements by FAO have enhanced this approach by using structural equation modelling instead of factor analysis to estimate the resilience index. Additionally, more variables have been included as proxies to represent institutional and natural environments [36]. Applying the RIMA-II model in Bangladesh offers a novel, structured econometric approach to measuring household resilience, an aspect largely absent in previous food security studies. Unlike traditional vulnerability assessments that rely on static indicators, RIMA-II conceptualizes resilience as a latent variable, allowing for a more nuanced and dynamic analysis of the factors influencing resilience capacity. While RIMA-II has been applied in various regions, its use in Bangladesh remains limited, with most existing studies focusing on food security determinants [37,38] or coping strategies [39–48] rather than the interactions among resilience components. Furthermore, prior research lacks a comprehensive resilience index beyond traditional vulnerability assessments, limiting its ability to capture the complex interconnections among resilience factors. Thus, this study makes two main contributions. Firstly, it investigates the key determinants shaping the resilience capacity of households, which influence their ability to adapt and recover from adverse conditions. Second, it assesses how resilience capacity translates into improved food security outcomes. By situating this analysis within the broader context of rural livelihoods, the study aims to provide empirical insights into the mechanisms through which resilience serves as a buffer against food insecurity, offering implications for policy interventions aimed at fostering sustainable rural development. When attempting to understand and enhance resilience, it is crucial to provide necessary resources and techniques to mitigate adverse outcomes, predict and prepare for shocks and stress, eliminate destructive coping mechanisms, and facilitate recovery [49]. Resilience in environmental and socioeconomic systems is demonstrated by responses to negative events and shocks [21], which encompass transformation, adaptation, and absorption responses [50–53]. Resilience, viewed as an intermediate outcome in socioeconomic studies, integrates capacities such as a household’s or community’s ability to cope with shocks [53]. Recent studies have endeavoured to integrate resilience into various development contexts, including food safety [22,54], well-being [55,56], rural development [57–59], and sustainable livelihoods [60–62]. The articles by [32,33] represent early efforts to define and quantify household resilience in the context of food insecurity. These studies focused on the household as the primary unit of analysis, recognising that crucial decisions regarding risk management made at this level, both before and after adverse events impacting food security [33] introduced a resilience index, treated as a latent variable that cannot be directly observed, and employed a two-stage factor analysis approach using measurable variables. Building on this framework [63] applied a similar latent variable model to measure resilience in Northern Bangladesh, highlighting the importance of comprehensively understanding resilience factors across various capacities. Additionally, d’Errico et al. investigated how shocks, particularly conflicts and climate events, influence resilience measurement [24]. Similarly, Ciani et al. aimed to assess household resilience to food insecurity in a changing environment using principal components and multivariate analysis of panel data. Their resilience index indicated that small landowners and agricultural wage workers exhibited lower resilience levels compared to other livelihood groups [64]. Dhraief et al. conducted a cross-sectional survey employing factor analysis and regression models. Their findings highlighted the significant roles of income and food access, adaptive capacity, and social safety nets in enhancing household resilience, as evidenced by their positive correlations with the resilience index [65]. Conversely, asset possession and climate change showed negative associations with household resilience in their study. However, contrasting findings in other studies have indicated that assets can have positive and notable effects [49,66,67]. Rural households generally exhibit less resilient to food shortages compared to urban and peri-urban households [68]. However, during the COVID-19 lockdowns, urban households experienced higher levels of food insecurity than rural households, yet they were more likely to resort to financial and food-compromising coping strategies [48]. Sassi et al. argued that households often turn to less preferred and cheaper food options during times of food insecurity, which can lead to long-term societal impacts and reduced ability to cope [69]. Large family households are particularly vulnerable to food insecurity, often relying on lower-quality meals and support from family or friends [70]. Ownership of assets also plays a crucial role in the resilience of smallholder farmers, with households possessing more assets generally exhibiting greater resilience to food insecurity [66]. Food-secure households typically exhibit higher dietary diversity and rely less on coping mechanisms, benefitting from adaptive and absorptive resilience capacities along with sufficient income [71]. Previous studies have highlighted that household resilience to food insecurity is influenced by factors such as income, assets, social safety nets, and adaptive capacity, with resilience levels varying across different livelihood groups and geographic locations [32,34,72,73]. However, findings on the role of assets remain inconclusive, calling for a more nuanced approach that differentiates asset types to better capture their distinct contributions to resilience. Despite the growing use of resilience measurement frameworks, studies in Bangladesh have yet to adopt a comprehensive approach that captures the interplay between various resilience components. Although prior research has identified the resilience determinants [48,63,74], few studies have specifically examined the suitability of RIMA-II for the Bangladeshi context [75]. Traditional vulnerability assessments often fail to account for critical dimensions such as access to services, adaptive strategies, and the differential roles of asset types as drivers of resilience. This study addresses these gaps by employing RIMA-II to systematically measure resilience as a latent construct, offering a more integrated and nuanced approach compared to earlier methods in rural Bangladesh. A key contribution of this research is the disaggregation of asset components, land, livestock, and farm equipment, to assess their distinct effects on resilience. This disaggregation is essential, as each asset type contributes differently to resilience in rural Bangladesh. Land ownership is vital for food production and long-term economic stability [76–78], while livestock assets, despite their perceived benefits, introduce risks related to market volatility [79–81], disease outbreaks [82–88], and climate vulnerability [89–92]. Farm equipment, on the other hand, plays a key role in mechanization and agricultural efficiency, making it distinct from the other asset categories [93–97]. Treating assets as a single, aggregate variable would overlook these critical differences in how they contribute to or detract from resilience. This approach ensures a more accurate and policy-relevant analysis of household resilience dynamics in Bangladesh. Furthermore, the use of Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to validate resilience determinants has been rare in prior research, emphasizing the need for this methodological advancement. By combining RIMA-II with a robust empirical framework, this study advances the understanding of resilience pathways and generates policy-relevant insights for improving food security in Bangladesh. It is increasingly recognised that one of the most effective ways to reduce or even avert food security crises is to create more resilient livelihoods [24,49]. The Resilience Index Measurement and Analysis (RIMA) was developed within this framework, with pioneering contributions by the FAO [34]. Employing a novel quantitative methodology, RIMA helps explain why and how certain households can withstand shocks and stressors more effectively than others. Resilience, being a multidimensional concept that cannot be directly observed, must be assessed through proxies by focusing on the needs of the most vulnerable groups. The new RIMA-II methodology offers enhanced guidance for successfully planning, implementing, overseeing, and assessing aid. The RIMA II model was employed to identify and study household resilience [36]. The RIMA-II model enables a better understanding of households` circumstances and needs, as well as identifying potential areas for improving future assistance. Access to Basic Services (ABS), Assets (AST), and Adaptive Capacity (AC) are the widely recognised pillars of the Resilience Capacity Index (RCI). Due to the lack of available data on Social Safety Nets (SSNs), our study focuses on the other three pillars. To estimate each pillar, variables were considered based on a literature review, data availability, context analysis, and statistical properties. ABS refers to the ability to meet households’ basic needs and encompasses the quality, effectiveness, and access to basic services [98]. This study assesses ABS through the following components: floor type (X1), wall type (X2), housing condition (X3), roof type (X4), sanitation type (X5), source of water (X6), cooking fuel type (X7), distance to health facilities from residence (in kilometers) (X8) and distance to the market (in kilometers) (X9). AC refers to a household’s ability to cope with and adapt to an unfamiliar situation, enabling them to maintain everyday affairs without long-term disruptions [32,36]. It indicates that more adaptive residents can handle adverse situations without reducing their standard of living [49,99]. In this study, this pillar includes the following components: household head`s employment location (X10), household head`s occupation type (X11), savings (X12), household income per month (X13), household head`s education year (X14), and diversified sources of income (X15). An essential prerequisite for shock response is AST, the second pillar of the RIMA-II model [32]. Assets encompass a household’s income-producing and not-producing assets [98], serving as indicators of the household’s economic circumstances and providing insight into the impact of shocks on households. The proxies used to construct AST include land holding (in decimal) (X16), land value (X17), livestock value (X18), livestock quantity (X19), farm equipment value (X20), farm equipment quantity (X21), and non-agricultural asset value (X22). The RIMA-II is divided into two sections: a descriptive and a causal analysis [98]. The RCI used to assess households and inform policy, is generated through descriptive analysis. The RCI is constructed in two stages. The first stage, the formative model, employs factor analysis of observable variables to estimate attributes (pillars) of resilience. The second stage, the measurement model, utilizes a Multiple Indicators Multiple Causes (MIMIC) model to calculate the RCI based on these pillars while considering the relationships between RCI and food security indicators. The developmental model links resilience to the pillars, while the measurement model focuses on food security indicators such as the Food Consumption Score (FCS) and Food Expenditure (FX). Food Consumption Score (FCS) collects household-level data on the diversity and frequency of food groups consumed over seven days. This data is weighted according to the relative nutritional value of each food group. The main food groups and their respective weights are: staples (weight 2), pulses (weight 3), vegetables (weight 1), fruit (weight 1), meat/fish (weight 4), milk (weight 4), sugar (weight 0.5) and oil (weight 0.5). To calculate FCS, the first step is to sum the consumption frequencies of food items within each group. Next, each food group`s total is multiplied by its respective weight [100]. Food Expenditure (FX) refers to the total cost of food obtained, whether purchased or acquired through other means, including both alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. This calculation also encompasses food expenditures on dining out at venues such as bars, restaurants, food courts, workplace canteens and street vendors [101]. FX is calculated by multiplying the quantity of food consumed over a seven-day period by its unit price, expressed in Bangladeshi Tk (1 US$ = 110 BDT (Bangladesh Bank, 2024). Based on the literature and the conceptual framework depicted in Fig 1, observable variables are expected to significantly influence latent variables or pillars. Furthermore, these latent variables are expected to have a significant impact on the RCI. Finally, the RCI is expected to significantly influence food security indicators, specifically, FCS and FX. Previous studies [14,15,19,20,25,29,41–43,76–79] have consistently highlighted the substantial influence of various observable variables on latent pillars, the significant impact of latent pillars on RCI, and the consequential effect of RCI on food security. Consequently, this study proposes the following hypotheses: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0332868.g001 The observed variables (X1, X2,.. Xn) used in this study were derived from the Bangladesh Integrated Household Survey (BIHS) 2018. This household survey is administered by Data Analysis and Technical Assistance Limited and designed and supervised by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI). The BIHS sample is statistically representative of rural Bangladesh, covering the nation`s seven administrative divisions: Barisal, Chittagong, Dhaka, Khulna, Rajshahi, Rangpur, and Sylhet. The survey includes 325 primary sampling units (PSUs) or villages, encompassing a total of 5,604 households in the BIHS dataset. Therefore, this study utilises a cross-sectional dataset of 5,604 households to achieve its research objectives. This dataset serves as the basis for assessing resilience through the pillars of ABS, AC, and AST, and their impact on the RCI and food security indicators. Twenty-two measurement items were used to construct latent pillars of the RCI, which is presented in Appendix Table 1 in S1 File. Each observable variable was assessed using a five-point summated Likert scale, where respondents rated their conditions (1 = very poor; 2 = poor; 3 = moderate; 4 = rich; 5 = very rich). The study utilized a quantitative approach. Initially, descriptive statistics were used to summarize and describe the observable variables of the pillars related to the pillars of resilience and food security indicators. This involved calculating measures such as means, standard deviations, and frequency distributions to provide a clear picture of the characteristics of the data. Statistical factorial analyses were employed to test the study’s hypotheses. To assess the factorial validity of the constructs and explore the latent pillars in the data, exploratory factor analysis was performed following [102]. Given the interconnections among latent constructs, we allowed for inter-factor correlation using the maximum likelihood factor extraction method with orthogonal varimax rotation. Subsequently, structural equation modeling (SEM) was exclusively used for descriptive purposes to understand the explanatory power of the pillars and their relationships with the RCI. This approach is a powerful statistical technique that allows researchers to test complex relationships among variables. It was used in this study to examine the linear correlations between the underlying factors (in this case, the pillars) and the latent variable RCI [103]. The formative model, represented by structural Equation (1), links resilience (η) to the pillars (xi). In contrast, the measurement model, represented by Equation (2), is defined by the Food Consumption Score (FCS) and household food expenditure (FX). The upper portion of the path diagram (Fig 2) illustrates the relationship between the resilience pillars, as measured by error εR, and the disturbance term of the structural estimation. The measuring model is represented by arrows pointing toward the food consumption Score and the food expenditure in the lower half of the structural model. Since the estimated RCI lacks a specific measurement scale, a scale has been proposed with the coefficient of the food consumption loading (˄1) set to 1. This assumption posits that a one standard deviation increase in RCI corresponds to a one standard deviation increase in food intake. This determination also establishes the unit of measurement for the other outcome indicator (˄2), alongside the variance of the two food security indicators, as depicted in Equations (3) and (4): https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0332868.g002 The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. It utilized publicly available data from the Bangladesh Integrated Household Survey (BIHS), administered by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI). The BIHS obtained formal written informed consent from all respondents prior to data collection. The summary statistics of all the attributes used to construct the resilience pillars are presented in Appendix Table 2 in S1 File. According to the established criteria [102,104], data is considered normal if kurtosis falls between −7 and +7 and the skewness between −2 and +2. However, our results indicate that some attribute values exceed these thresholds, suggesting potential outliers that may be excluded from further analysis. Cronbach’s alpha assesses with which respondents answer items on a scale or subscale [105]. A Cronbach’s alpha score greater than 0.6 is generally considered reliable with values between 0.6 to 0.8 deemed acceptable [106,107]. The reliability alpha value for the adaptive capacity (AC) pillar significantly exceeded the threshold of 0.70, indicating adequate reliability [105]. The other four pillars also demonstrated reliability, with Cronbach’s alpha values greater than 0.60 [106–108]. Following the initial reliability assessment, Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was employed to explore the latent factor structure. The maximum likelihood method was used to identify components and establish the pattern matrix. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) measure of sampling adequacy was 0.778, surpassing the maximum acceptable level of 0.5 [109]. The criteria, which include a significant correlation matrix determinant of 0.009, a KMO value of 0.778, and a significant Bartlett’s Chi-square of χ2 = 26648.163, p = 0.000, confirmed the adequacy of the sample size chosen for the study [110], indicating sufficient intercorrelation for factorial analysis. Initially identifying ten factors, we retained five factors that collectively explained 82.68% of the total variance in the data, exceeding the acceptable threshold of 60% [102]. Table 1 presents the pattern matrix, demonstrating how each numbered questionnaire item loaded precisely (values above 0.50 on a single component) onto its respective factor. Typically, minimum item-factor loadings of 0.3 to 0.4 are recommended [111–113]. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0332868.t001 Table 1 categorizes items X1(floor type), X2 (wall type), and X3 (housing condition) under factor 1 as ABS, explaining 29.74% of the total variance. Factor 2, labelled AC, includes X10 (household head`s employment location) and X11 (household head`s occupation type), explaining 23.49% of the variance. Factors 3 and 4 are labelled Ld_A and Lv_A, respectively, and explain 11.09% and 10.25% of the variance. They comprise items X16 (land size), X17 (land value), X18 (livestock value), and X19 (livestock quantity). Item X20 (farm equipment value) and X21 (farm equipment quantity) of factor 5 are labelled FE. Although factors Ld_A, Lv_A, and FE collectively represent the single factor named Assets (AST), they are labelled as separate factors based on our country’s perspective. The loadings of the items range from 0.51 to 0.92. Table 2 presents the correlation matrix of the five factors included in the analysis. ABS shows significant positive correlations with Ld_A (0.042) and FE (0.034) at the 1% significance level, as these factors contribute to higher income levels that enable households to afford better services. ABS also negatively correlates with AC (0.028) and Lv_A (0.026) at the 5% and 10% significance levels, respectively, possibly due to market volatility and health-related concerns affecting livestock income and service accessibility. AC demonstrates a significant positive correlation with Ld_A (0.023) and Lv_A (0.035) at the 10% and 1% significance levels, respectively, but shows an insignificant correlation with FE (0.017). Ld_A shows a significant positive correlation with both Lv_A (0.047) and FE (0.072) at the 1% level. Lv_A and FE correlate significantly at the 5% level (0.030). Despite the correlations observed among factors, there is no evidence of significant multicollinearity, as no correlation coefficient exceeds 0.8 [114–116]. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0332868.t002 Table 3 presents the findings from the multiple indicators multiple causes (MIMIC) model, which was derived using structural equation modelling. In this case, we consider the broader contextual framework to accurately analyze the 2018 data, which includes ongoing food insecurity, a substantial influx of Rohingya refugees facing acute malnutrition amidst monsoon-related hazards, and deep-rooted structural vulnerabilities such as limited agricultural diversification. These factors influenced both households` potential for resilience and the outcomes observed in our SEM model. Study shows that ABS exhibits a significant coefficient of 0.429, indicating that a well-structured living condition with essential facilities enhances households’ resilience capacity. This finding also indicates that households with better access to essential services are more equipped to cope with food insecurity and recover from shocks. Thus, the study’s findings support hypothesis A: access to basic services significantly influences the resilience capacity index. Our results reveal a positive correlation between ABS and RCI (Table 3), consistent with previous studies [32,36,117,118], which suggest that access to basic services enhances economic opportunities, knowledge, and overall well-being, thereby contributing to greater resilience. In contrast, studies by [53,66,119,120] report a negative association, attributing decreasing service quality as households become poorer in their respective countries. Previous studies have often identified AC as a significant influencing factor [24,65,67,121,117]. However, our findings indicate that AC is a positive but insignificant factor, suggesting that institutional and economic barriers impede the effectiveness of this factor. While education, skill development, access to information, and access to credit are critical components of AC, their impact on resilience is highly dependent on external factors such as labor market conditions and institutional access [122,123]. This discrepancy may be attributed to Bangladesh`s high vulnerability to global changes, significant socio-economic challenges, and limitations in institutional capacity [124–126]. In Bangladesh, people are unable to leverage their adaptive skills for resilience due to a lack of employment opportunities [119,125,127,128]. Moreover, limited access to credit, and financial services may restrict households from transferring their adaptive strategies to long-term stability [43,125,128]. Furthermore, gender-based disparities in access to resources and decision-making power also undermine the significance of AC [54,129–133]. As a result, households in Bangladesh may exhibit lower adaptive capacity compared to those in other developing or developed countries [43,47,134,135]. Thus, our results do not support hypothesis B: adaptive capacity significantly influences the resilience capacity index. The “Resilience Index Measurement and Analysis II” report by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) discusses how adaptive capacity contributes to resilience but notes that its impact may not always be significant in certain contexts [36]. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0332868.t003 The critical role of assets in resilience capacity has been widely recognised, as they constitute the most significant pillar for the RCI. Similar findings have been reported by other authors, such as [49,66,67,119] in the context of Malian and Ethiopian households, highlighting assets as the most pertinent factor for RCI, which aligns with our study findings. However, this study takes a more granular approach to segregating the assets into three distinct categories; land asset, livestock asset, and farm equipment, to identify their unique contributions to resilience building. This disaggregation is crucial, as each asset type plays a unique role in shaping a household`s ability to withstand and recover from food insecurity shocks. In the context of Bangladesh, only a small proportion of households own all three asset types of assets simultaneously, making it essential to analyse their individual and combined impacts on resilience. Our results demonstrate a significant coefficient of 0.119 for Ld_A and 0.042 for FE, indicating a positive influence on RCI, thereby corroborating hypotheses C and E. Land assets are crucial for resilience building as they provide financial stability and income through agriculture [76–78,136]. Additionally, having farm equipment ensures household mechanization and agricultural efficiency, which boosts farm production and enhances household resilience [93–97]. Since these assets play distinct roles in shaping resilience capacity, it is essential to calculate them separately. However, Lv_A demonstrates a significant negative value of 0.053 suggesting that it has a significant negative impact on resilience in Bangladesh. Because it has a high mortality rate of livestock due to natural disasters and high disease outbreaks [137,138]. High vulnerability to climate change may, directly and indirectly, affect livestock production systems, resulting in negative asset values [47,89–92,139–142]. Lv_A are influenced by several interrelated factors that exhibit a counterintuitive negative relationship with resilience, such as market volatility, disease outbreaks, high maintenance cost, and climatic vulnerability. During economic downturns or supply chain disruptions, farmers are forced to sell their livestock at lower prices, undermining their financial stability [79–81]. Disease outbreaks, such as foot-and-mouth disease or avian influenza, frequently affect livestock in Bangladesh, resulting in significant economic losses for rural households. Limited access to veterinary care and inadequate disease prevention measures exacerbate this issue [82–88]. Livestock also involves costly sectors such as feeding, healthcare, and shelter, imposing additional financial burdens on households. While land or farm equipment offers long-term productivity gains, livestock requires continuous investment, making it a riskier asset for resilience building. These combined factors suggest that although livestock is traditionally seen as a liquid asset, it needs more infrastructural development to contribute to long-term resilience in the Bangladeshi context. Consequently, Lv_A cannot verify hypothesis D, which suggests that livestock assets positively influence resilience capacity. Our study indicates that RCI positively influences FCS and FX with significant coefficients of 0.778 and 0.688, respectively. That means households with higher resilience are less likely to experience deteriorating food security and are better positioned to maintain or restore food consumption and expenditure [24]. Policymakers should prioritize resilience-building as a core component of food security programming, employing multidimensional frameworks such as RIMA-II in Bangladesh for targeted, long-term strategies. Our results support hypotheses F and G, which concern the impact of resilience on food consumption and expenditure. These outcomes remain robust across various model specifications. The results presented in Table 4 indicate that the model under consideration exhibits a significant likelihood ratio Chi-square of 1200.82 at the 1% significance level. The first chi-square compares the model against the saturated test, while the second chi-square compares the baseline versus the saturated model. The saturated model demonstrates a perfect fit for the covariance structure. According to Browne et al., the root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA) indicates an adequate fit with values between 0.05 and 0.08 [143]. A value close to one on both the Tucker-Lewis index (TLI) and the comparative fit index (CFI) denotes a good fit, as suggested by Hair et al. and Bentler [102,144]. The coefficient of determination (CD = 1.00) also confirms a perfect fit. Typically, for an adequate fit, the standardised root mean square residual (SRMR) should be less than 0.05, as recommended by Hu and Bentler [145]. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0332868.t004 Our study results demonstrate that access to basic services, land assets, and farm equipment significantly enhances household resilience. The positive impact of these factors on RCI suggests promising avenues for further research. Future studies could delve into how these components bolster agricultural system resilience, aiding government efforts in designing effective action plans. Exploring potential interactions among these factors could yield insights into the intricate dynamics of resilience. Interestingly, adaptive capacity showed no noticeable impact on RCI, highlighting the distinction between adaptation and resilience. Although our study indicates that livestock has a negative impact on resilience, it remains an invaluable resource for food security, income generation, and financial stability in rural economies. Livestock plays a crucial role in resilience management by acting as a liquid asset during economic crises, enhancing agricultural output through soil fertility and draft power, and improving access to financing. Building resilience remains the most effective strategy to withstand shocks. In developing countries, policies and programs aimed at improving household resilience can significantly advance long-term food security. Humanitarian resilience initiatives should prioritize addressing rural populations` needs, as they face heightened exposure to food insecurity. Study results indicate that prioritising access to basic services such as healthcare, education, and sanitation in rural areas is crucial for fostering local and national resilience. Furthermore, enhancing incentives for land protection and promoting sustainable land management practices can enhance agricultural resilience. Policies supporting agricultural technology and equipment can also bolster resilience. Implementing social safety nets and encouraging farmers to diversify their revenue streams are effective strategies beyond human-centric protection measures. To enhance the sustainability of livestock assets, policymakers should focus on improving the affordability and accessibility of veterinary services and climate-resilient livestock management at the grassroots level. Subsidies on livestock medicine, feed, and improved breeds should also be provided to reduce maintenance costs. Strengthening adaptive capacity requires skill-based education, financial inclusion, and institutional support to foster entrepreneurship and human capital development, thereby creating more employment opportunities and improving infrastructure. Additionally, targeted awareness programs should encourage women’s participation in household and community decision-making, ensuring gender-inclusive resilience-building strategies. However, the data used in our analysis were not explicitly gathered for resilience measurement purposes, which may limit the depth and accuracy of our study. Using cross-sectional data limits the ability to capture dynamic changes in household resilience over time, as it provides only a snapshot rather than reflecting long-term trends. Thereby restricts our ability to draw definitive conclusions about long-term resilience to food insecurity. It is important to acknowledge that, while this study emphasizes the role of land access and basic services in strengthening household resilience, social capital, gender dynamics, and power disparities are also significant, though less visible, factors influencing resilience in rural Bangladesh. These factors could not be explicitly incorporated into the SEM analysis due to dataset constraints. Furthermore, the absence of data related to recent shocks, disasters, or conflicts in our analysis limits the comprehensiveness of our study. These data constraints hinder our ability to examine the impact of acute events on household resilience, potentially overlooking critical dimensions of resilience dynamics. Future research should utilize longitudinal datasets specifically designed for resilience measurement, incorporating multiple survey rounds to capture temporal dynamics. Additionally, integrating socio-institutional variables with real-time data on shocks, disasters, and conflicts will enhance the comprehensiveness of resilience analysis, enabling a more accurate assessment of household responses to food insecurity.

Title: Forbes Daily: The Trump Family’s White House Windfall

ByDanielle Chemtob, Forbes Staff andForbes Daily, Forbes Staff. For fans of the Savannah Bananas, it’s about more than just baseball. In a more fast-paced version of the sport known as Banana Ball, players backflip as they catch fly balls, take choreographed dance breaks between batters and more. The Bananas have sold out all 115 games on their 2025 schedule, and are even more popular online, with a larger social audience than any MLB franchise. The unusual approach is paying off: Forbes estimates that the four-team Banana Ball organization will post more than $100 million in revenue this year, and that the Bananas are worth somewhere in the neighborhood of $500 million. That’s about half as much as MLB’s least valuable team, the Miami Marlins. President Donald Trump issued a proclamation Friday that would impose an annual $100,000 fee on H-1B visa applications, which are used by companies to hire skilled workers from abroad. It’s a dramatic increase over existing program fees, which include $215 to register for the lottery and $780 for the petition. MORE: Shares of major Indian tech services firms plunged sharply on Monday in response, and U.S. tech giants Google, Meta and Microsoft, which are among the biggest sponsors of H-1B visas for foreign workers, were also down in premarket trading. Around 73% of all H-1B workers whose applications were approved in the fiscal year 2023 were Indian born, the Pew Research Center reported, while China ranked a distant second with 12% approvals. The decision to suspend Jimmy Kimmel’s late-night show put a spotlight on Nexstar Media, the largest TV station owner and operator in the U.S., and its founder Perry Sook, who has largely stayed out of the spotlight over nearly four decades as chairman. Sook, who was compensated roughly $35 million as Nexstar’s chief executive in 2024, told investors in an earnings call shortly after Election Day that he hoped a second Trump Administration would help the firm expand further. President Donald Trump said Chinese President Xi Jinping approved the deal that would keep TikTok online in the U.S., and the White House said on Saturday the deal would be signed “in the coming days.” Six of the seven board seats for TikTok’s U.S. entity will be occupied by Americans, who will also oversee the platform’s algorithm, and Oracle, the cloud computing firm headed by billionaire Larry Ellison, will lead TikTok’s “data and privacy.” Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence firm xAI is expected to raise $10 billion in a funding round that would give the company a $200 billion valuation, CNBC reported. That would make xAI worth more than competitor Anthropic’s $183 billion, but less than ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which is eyeing a secondary share selloff that could value it at $500 billion. Private equity firm Veritas Capital counts on government spending for the majority of its portfolio companies’ revenue, and CEO Ramzi Musallam remains confident about its growth despite cuts from the Trump Administration’s Department of Government Efficiency. Veritas closed its ninth flagship fund at $14.4 billion earlier this month, and Musallam says the firm is focused on companies with “must-have” technology that reduces wasteful spending. No U.S. president, or extended family, has used the office to profit as successfully as the Trumps. With crypto as the big driver, the family (including the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner) is now worth an estimated $10 billion, having nearly doubled their net worth since last year’s election. As a cofounder of 3BRAND, New York Giants quarterback Russell Wilson has quietly built a children’s sportswear company that surpassed $100 million in sales in 2024, despite headwinds in the retail market. It’s one of many business endeavors for Wilson, who tied for No. 49 on Forbes’ 2025 list of the world’s highest-paid athletes. Hundreds of airports may no longer require you to remove liquids from bags during security screenings, but it’s too soon for the policy to officially change nationwide, aviation security experts say. The latest X-ray technology can create three-dimensional images of passengers’ carry-on bags, but it could take at least a decade before all U.S. airports have the newer scanners. GPUs (graphics processing units), commonly designed by chip giant Nvidia, have become a crucial engine for artificial intelligence. Access to them can determine a company’s fortunes, and CoreWeave, which trades on the Nasdaq, has built a $50 billion (market cap) business by becoming one of their go-to brokers. After pioneering a new kind of financing that helped CoreWeave borrow $29 billion, CEO Michael Intrator now balances shareholders’ qualms about deepening debt and widespread fears about an AI bubble with his broader ambition: to provide compute not just to the tech giants but to every company integrating AI into its operations. In less than a decade, the business has spun up a data center empire, booking $1.9 billion in revenue in 2024 (net losses: $860 million, for a negative 45% margin) and $2.2 billion in the first half of 2025 (net losses: $605 million, or –28%). Its stock price has more than doubled since its March IPO, trouncing the broader Nasdaq’s return of 23.9% and minting at least five billionaires in the process. Intrator is now worth $6.7 billion, landing him on The Forbes 400 list of the richest Americans for the first time, along with cofounder Brian Venturo. The company’s remarkable growth has stemmed from ferocious global demand for GPUs. The AI cloud computing market was $230 billion in 2024 and, assuming the boom continues, is poised to explode to $400 billion by 2028, according to Wall Street analysts. “I’ve never seen a supply/demand imbalance like this in the 40 years I’ve been investing,” says Mark Klein, CEO of SuRo Capital, which invested a total of $25 million in CoreWeave. WHY IT MATTERS “CoreWeave has catapulted into prominence as one of the leading AI cloud compute providers with marquee customers like OpenAI, Microsoft and Meta,” says Forbes staff writer Rashi Shrivastava. “Shedding its crypto past and betting big on the value of Nvidia’s coveted GPUs, Michael Intrator took his company to a $50 billion valuation. But he relied (heavily) on debt, backed by those very GPUs that are depreciating a lot faster today. With billions on the line and concerns of an AI bubble, the stakes are far greater than ever before.” MORE This AI Cloud Provider Just Minted Four New Billionaires Workplaces often run on ambition—but many overachievers burn themselves out as a result of never feeling like they’re allowed to take a break. It’s critical to normalize taking strategic pauses for reflection after major sprints, and don’t just reward those who keep up the highest output for the longest. Ambition can be energizing and fulfilling if pursued sustainably. A federal judge threw out President Donald Trump’s $15 billion lawsuit against the New York Times on Friday. What was the reason? A. It didn’t have merit B. Insufficient evidence C. Statute of limitations D. It was too long Check your answer. Thanks for reading!

Title: Google faces antitrust déjà vu as US seeks to break up digital advertising business

After deflecting the U.S. Justice Department’s attack on its illegal monopoly in online search, Google is facing another attempt to dismantle its internet empire during a trial focused on its abusive tactics in digital advertising After deflecting the U.S. Justice Department's attack on its illegal monopoly in online search, Google is facing another attempt to dismantle its internet empire in a trial focused on its abusive tactics in digital advertising. The trial scheduled to begin Monday in an Alexandria, Virginia, federal court will revolve around the harmful conduct that resulted in U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema declaring parts of Google's digital advertising technology to be an illegal monopoly. The judge found that Google has been engaging in behavior that stifles competition to the detriment of online publishers that depend on the system for revenue. Google and the Justice Department will spend the next two weeks in court presenting evidence in a “remedy” trial that will culminate in Brinkema issuing a ruling on how to restore fair market conditions. Although the judge hasn't set a timetable for making that decision, it's unlikely to come down before the end of this year because additional legal briefs and courtroom arguments are expected to extend into November before Brinkema takes the matter under submission. No matter how the judge rules, Google says it will appeal the earlier decision labeling the ad network as a monopoly. Appeals can't be filed until the remedy is determined. The case, filed in 2023 under President Joe Biden's administration, threatens the complex network that Google has spent the past 17 years building to power its dominant digital advertising business. Besides accounting for most of the $305 billion in revenue that Google's services division generates for its corporate parent Alphabet Inc., digital advertising sales provide the lifeblood that keeps thousands of websites alive. If the Justice Department gets its way, Brinkema will order Google to sell parts of its ad technology — a proposal that the company's lawyers warned would “invite disruption and damage” to consumers and the internet's ecosystem. The Justice Department contends a breakup would be the most effective and quickest way to undercut a monopoly that has been stifling competition and innovation for years. Google believes it has already made enough changes to its “Ad Manager” system, including providing more options and pricing options, to resolve the issues the Brinkema flagged in her monopoly ruling., The legal battle over Google's advertising technology mirrors another showdown that the company recently navigated after another federal judge condemned its dominant search engine as an illegal monopoly and then held remedy hearings earlier this year to consider how to stop the misconduct. In that case, the Justice Department also proposed a severe crackdown that would have required Google to sell its popular Chrome browser, but U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta decided a less dramatic shake-up was needed amid a search market being reshaped by artificial intelligence technology in a decision issued earlier this month. Even though Google didn't agree with all aspects of Mehta's decision, the ruling was widely seen as a slap on the wrist — a sentiment that has helped propel Alphabet's stock price to new highs. The 20% gain since Mehta's decision helped make Alphabet only the fourth publicly traded company to reach a market value of $3 trillion — an increase of more than $1 trillion since Brinkema branded Google's ad technology as a monopoly in April. In an indication that the outcome of the search monopoly case might sway things in the advertising technology proceedings, Brinkema asked both Google and the Justice Department to address Mehta's decision during the upcoming trial. As they did in the search case, Google's lawyers already have been asserting in court papers that AI technology being used by ad network rivals like Meta Platforms is reshaping the way the market works and overriding the need for the Justice Department's “radical” proposals. The Justice Department is “fighting for a remedy that would vanquish a past that has been overtaken by technological and market transformations in the way digital ads are consumed," Google's lawyers argued leading up to the trial. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

Title: CoreWeave’s $29 Billion Bet That Its Debt-Fueled AI Boom Won’t Go Bust

ByRashi Shrivastava, Forbes Staff andPhoebe Liu, Forbes Staff. It was a sunny day in August 2017, and CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator was beginning to think he might actually set his Manhattan office tower on fire. Dozens of powerful Nvidia GPUs were plugged into every available outlet, churning through the convoluted math required to mine cryptocurrency, and they were throwing off a ton of heat. With the air conditioning turned off for the weekend, the sixth-floor Financial District office had turned into a 130-degree hotbox. “I flipped. This wasn’t really built for this,” Intrator says. “I was just like, ‘We’ve got to go. We’ve got to go.’ ” He and his cofounders, Brian Venturo and Brannin McBee, scrambled, frantically disconnecting servers that were almost too hot to touch and loading them into a pickup truck before heading to New Jersey, where a garage properly ventilated with a gigantic exhaust fan waited to cool them. Nearly a decade later, some things haven’t changed. Intrator is still running GPUs, but on an exponentially larger scale. Now he’s got some 250,000 of them warehoused across the 33 data centers that CoreWeave operates, renting out access to their number-crunching prowess to compute-hungry customers. Once popular for rendering graphics for video games and mining crypto, GPUs (graphics processing units), commonly designed by chip giant Nvidia, have become a crucial engine for artificial intelligence. Access to them can determine a company’s fortunes, and CoreWeave, which trades on the Nasdaq, has built a $50 billion (market cap) business by becoming one of their go-to brokers, serving the likes of Microsoft, OpenAI and Meta in the race for AI ascendency. There is still the risk of fire—at least in a monetary sense. After pioneering a new kind of financing that helped CoreWeave borrow $29 billion, largely in loans backed by its GPUs, Intrator now balances shareholders’ qualms about deepening debt and widespread fears about an AI bubble with his broader ambition: to provide compute not just to the tech giants but to every company integrating AI into its operations. It’s not an unreasonable goal. In less than a decade, the Livingston, New Jersey–based business has spun up a data center empire, booking $1.9 billion in revenue in 2024 (net losses: $860 million, for a negative 45% margin) and $2.2 billion in the first half of 2025 (net losses: $605 million, or –28%). By 2031, it hopes to bring in another $30 billion, mostly from contracts with A-list customers like IBM and Meta and a string of AI startups such as Cohere and Mistral. Its stock price has more than doubled since its March IPO, trouncing the broader Nasdaq’s return of 23.9% and minting at least five billionaires in the process. Intrator, 56, is now worth $6.7 billion, landing him on The Forbes 400 list of the richest Americans for the first time, along with cofounder Venturo, 40, who’s worth $4.2 billion. Cofounders McBee and Peter Salanki, as well as early investor Jack Cogen, are also new billionaires thanks to CoreWeave. The company’s remarkable growth has stemmed from ferocious global demand for GPUs. Startups have been strapped for those sophisticated chips since ChatGPT exploded in popularity in 2022, with even OpenAI in February delaying rolling out a major model upgrade because it ran out of chips to run it on. That means whoever has GPUs holds the keys to an enormous business opportunity: The AI cloud computing market was $230 billion in 2024 and, assuming the boom continues, is poised to explode to $400 billion by 2028, according to Wall Street analysts. “I’ve never seen a supply/demand imbalance like this in the 40 years I’ve been investing,” says Mark Klein, CEO of SuRo Capital, which invested a total of $25 million in CoreWeave. Thanks to good instincts, a substantial appetite for risk and a dash of luck, Intrator realized early that his crypto company’s GPU stockpile could be good for more than minting tokens. A strategic relationship with Nvidia helped with the rest, positioning CoreWeave as one of the predominant cloud providers for the AI era. At first Silicon Valley investors weren’t convinced that CoreWeave could hold its own against well-capitalized cloud titans like Amazon, Microsoft and Google, which remain both arch-competitors and, in some cases, important customers. “The overwhelming majority of [investors] thought we were insane,” Intrator says. Spurned by VCs, he turned to the debt markets, what he calls “East Coast money.” Top-tier private creditors like Blackstone and Magnetar financed the multibillion buildout of CoreWeave’s infrastructure so it could capitalize on AI’s insatiable appetite for compute. Debt financing also meant that Intrator and his cofounders held on to more precious equity; Intrator retains 13%, Venturo 7%. The scale is the key, Venturo says. “The capital intensity of this business is all that matters.” Critics are spooked by the $11.2 billion in debt on CoreWeave’s balance sheet. And with interest rates ranging from 7% to 15%, expenses remain high: The company spent more than $250 million paying interest on that debt last quarter on just $19 million in operating income. Plus about half of CoreWeave’s assets are GPUs, which are said to depreciate over six years—or less, now that Nvidia is upgrading its chips faster. D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria doesn’t mince words: “This is a value-destructive entity.” Naysayers also point out that 62% of CoreWeave’s $1.9 billion revenue in 2024 came from one extremely large customer: Microsoft. That dependence won’t last long, though: OpenAI has committed to spending a total of $15.9 billion on CoreWeave’s infrastructure over the next five years and received a $350 million stake in the company. CoreWeave recently inked a deal to supply computing power to Google, and IBM has been using CoreWeave’s GPU clusters as well. “Our researchers can focus on the AI and less on the infrastructure,” says IBM Cloud CTO Hillery Hunter. Then there’s the existential question: Is the AI boom actually a bubble? In the first half of 2025, investors plowed $104 billion into artificial intelligence startups at towering valuations, per PitchBook, betting that AI really will turn out to be as revolutionary as the internet or the automobile and upend entire industries. That hasn’t happened yet. Despite spending billions on generative AI, many businesses haven’t seen material returns on it. Most AI companies still haven’t turned a profit. Even Sam Altman, AI’s chief carnival barker, is warning that overexuberant investors could “get burned.” That’s especially worrisome for CoreWeave, given its precarious, highly leveraged position as the industry’s premier GPU provider. Put another way: If this bubble were to pop, CoreWeave’s business would rupture along with it. Intrator’s talent for creative number crunching first emerged when he was a commodities trader at Natsource, a New York–based carbon credit trading and greenhouse gas asset mana­ger. There, from 1998 through the Enron scandal to 2014, he learned how to turn pollution into a financial instrument—just as he would later do with GPUs. After his first venture, a natural gas hedge fund, failed, Intrator and his cofounders pivoted, forming Atlantic Crypto in 2017 to mine ether. “We founded the company on a credit card,” Intrator says. “It was like, ‘Okay, I’ll buy a couple GPUs. What the hell?’ ” When crypto experienced one of its periodic crashes in 2018, the cofounders bought thousands of GPUs from miners going out of business for pennies on the dollar and raked in an estimated $80 million in revenue from mining. “Ethereum kept them alive long enough for them to make the transition to AI,” says early investor Nic Carter. Given ether’s volatility, Intrator realized the more lucrative bet was not fickle cryptocurrency but the equipment used to mine it. Their servers could be configured for different use cases: rendering 3D images, animation or early AI efforts. In 2019, they swapped out their “crappy” mining GPUs with data center–grade chips on a dollar-for-dollar basis. “Looking back on it, it was genius,” Venturo says. Their first break into AI came through a collaboration with Eleuther AI, a Washington, D.C.–based research nonprofit, in late 2021. CoreWeave shelled out $2 million to buy a bunch of Nvidia’s A100 chips and built a cluster of 96 GPUs for the organization, which was training a powerful open-source large language model. It did what Eleuther wanted but was plagued by bugs, networking issues and storage problems. At one point the nonprofit’s employees had to use an external storage device to manually offload data to ensure the system wouldn’t crash. “That was the tuition to learn how to build the infrastructure,” Intrator says. It was also a path to some early customers. Through Eleuther, CoreWeave found Stability AI, the creator of a viral early AI text-to-image generator called Stable Diffusion. That’s when Venturo saw the first outlines of an enormous business opportunity. But CoreWeave would need to double down on Nvidia’s chips to seize it. It would be “the most important thing this company is ever going to do,” he says. To buy those GPUs, CoreWeave needed cash—a lot of it, and fast. In late 2022, Evanston, Illinois–based asset mana­ger Magnetar Capital invested $100 million, giving CoreWeave the ammunition to buy thousands of Nvidia H100 chips and provide computational power for AI at scale. It later co-led a $2.3 billion round, CoreWeave’s first GPU-backed loan. Intrator’s genius: convincing Magnetar to secure the funds using the very chips he was buying as collateral. “They laid the groundwork for debt financing in the GPU space,” says Darrick Horton, CEO of cloud computing rival TensorWave. It was an unprecedented and risky move, but when Chat­GPT took AI mainstream in November 2022, Intrator’s gamble paid off. In January 2023, CoreWeave signed a $300 million deal with early AI darling Inflection to build a 22,000-GPU AI cluster, one of the world’s largest at the time. “We went from having nothing sold to having everything sold five times over,” Venturo says. By December 2022, CoreWeave had bought so many GPUs from Nvidia that its leadership took notice. The cofounders got a call out of the blue; Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang wanted to talk. Twenty minutes later, they were on a Zoom call with him, pitching the cofounder of the world’s largest semiconductor company on investing in a no-name former crypto miner. Huang saw in CoreWeave an opportunity to strengthen Nvidia’s dominance in the AI market by propping up a future buyer for its complex chips that had the technical expertise to run them efficiently, Intrator says. Nvidia invested some $350 million in CoreWeave for a 5% stake (now worth $2.5 billion) and granted it “elite” status on its partner network, vaulting it to the front of the line for the company’s most cutting-edge chips. (Nvidia declined to comment for this story.) It’s quite the incestuous relationship. (Intrator prefers “symbiotic.”) Nvidia is a vendor, an investor and a customer; it has paid CoreWeave at least $320 million for its infrastructure and agreed to buy its unsold capacity through 2032. But it is by no means a relationship of equals. In fiscal 2025 (ended January), Nvidia made $72.9 billion profit on $130.5 billion revenue. Its current market capitalization exceeds $4.3 trillion. D.A. Davidson analyst Luria puts it directly: “CoreWeave wouldn’t exist if Nvidia didn’t want it to.” As CoreWeave landed larger contracts, it took on more debt to fulfill them. In 2023, it struck a deal with Microsoft, which reportedly plans to spend $10 billion on its cloud computing services through 2030. That was enough for Blackstone to lead $2.3 billion in debt financing in 2023, followed by a fatter $7.5 billion check in 2024. “We are underwriting contracts, capacity and power, not a particular ‘story,’ ” says Jas Khaira, a senior managing director at Blackstone, adding that the due diligence process ensured the contracts were airtight and customers like Microsoft couldn’t easily walk away. Inside a coolly lit data center in Orangeburg, New York, about 40 minutes north of Midtown Manhattan, rows of what look like hospital IV bags hang across long banks of densely packed black shelves. Each bag dispenses a drip of neon-green cooling fluid to a rack of GPU-filled servers when needed, keeping them at the safe, always-on temperature at which they help pay for CoreWeave’s considerable investment in them. Just how much revenue those servers can deliver depends on two things: how long AI’s demand for compute will outstrip supply and how long it will take AI companies to catch up. Microsoft, for instance, spent $88 billion on capex in the year ending June 2025, most of which was for AI infrastructure. Open AI reportedly signed a $300 billion deal with Oracle recently to provide compute—part of its President Trump–endorsed Stargate partnership—calling into question the future of its contracts with CoreWeave. Aside from the hyperscaling incumbents, CoreWeave must also battle cloud computing rivals like Crusoe, Nebius and Lambda, many of which have landed contracts with CoreWeave’s big tech clients, who use multiple cloud providers to reduce dependence on just one. “Renewal and retention is a risk,” says Macquarie analyst Paul Golding. “We think about risk in a more sophisticated way than almost anyone else in the space.” And then there’s that debt. CoreWeave has no plans to stop borrowing against its GPUs—debt could rise to $30 billion in two years, per JPMorgan projections. Some analysts are worried about the risk of doing that, especially amid ongoing net losses ($2.1 billion in total since 2023) in a fast-moving industry. Intrator has heard and dismissed all this before. “No shit, I’m borrowing money,” he says, gesticulating defiantly at his Wall Street haters while en route to CoreWeave’s Manhattan office. McBee backs him up. “There’s no risk,” he says, improbably. They claim each CoreWeave contract (average length: four years) prices in most of the costs of delivering on it—GPUs, data center buildouts and interest payments—plus depreciation and maintenance. If all goes as planned, then, CoreWeave is left with some profit plus the value of its GPUs. Generally, contracts are structured to generate approximately $2 of revenue for every dollar of debt to be repaid, McBee says. The risk, of course, is that the AI boom goes bubble and pops—and those contracts are never fulfilled, leaving CoreWeave with a ton of idle servers and a mountain of debt. Citi analyst Tyler Radke forecasts CoreWeave could be profitable as early as next year. It’s losing money because of interest payments and because infrastructure costs a lot to build upfront. “We think about risk in a more sophisticated way than almost anyone else in the space,” Intrator says. Maybe. But many credit rating agencies categorize CoreWeave’s latest bonds as junk. Even if the boom times continue, things could go south fast if the company can’t build out what it has promised, as quickly as promised. Then there are the known unknowns: regulatory hurdles, manufacturing mishaps, local opposition. Protests alone have already stopped or slowed $64 billion in data center projects, according to Data Center Watch. And CoreWeave is already facing opposition over a new facility in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, where it’s investing $6 billion. When it’s finished, it is expected to consume four times as much power as all the region’s homes, says Lancaster resident Emma Burgess. Residents of the community known for its Amish history recently packed city council meetings to voice their concerns: too little community input, too much electricity, too much pollution (both air and noise). McBee says there hasn’t been pushback at the site, but acknowledges “you’re gonna break things along the way.” Because CoreWeave’s AI data centers need to be on 24/7/365, they can’t be subject to the fluctuations that come with wind and solar power. So for the time being “it’s gas,” McBee says. “That’s what we prefer.” In May, CoreWeave acquired AI software developer Weights & Biases for $1 billion, a deal it hopes will diversify its customer base. A planned $9 billion acquisition of data center owner Core Scientific—which could bring some 1.5 gigawatts of additional contracted power—would more than quadruple CoreWeave’s current active power, provided regulators and shareholders allow it. Next up: investing in AI startups with a combo of cash and GPU access. Things are volatile. CoreWeave’s market cap has swung by some $70 billion since its rocky March IPO. Tariffs could further unsettle its bottom line. Its biggest customer just signed a huge deal with a rival fast encroaching on its turf. Delays, of both capital and equipment, could kill CoreWeave’s head start. None of this has fazed Intrator, who’s confident his GPU-backed debt will pay off and keep his company growing alongside rampant demand for AI compute. As the markets rise, so too will CoreWeave, buoyed by the prescient bets that made it a $50 billion behemoth in just six years. But it’s still beholden to the biggest gamble of all—that the AI bubble won’t burst. This story has been updated to clarify a statement about Microsoft’s projected capital expenditures.

Title: Palantir Wants to Be a Lifestyle Brand
URL: https://www.wired.com/story/palantir-wants-to-be-a-lifestyle-brand/
Time Published: 2025-09-22T10:00:00Z
Full Content:
Palantir Technologies, which moved from Silicon Valley to Denver in 2020, sells software that immigration authorities use to identify and arrest people, militaries use to organize drone strikes, and corporations use to manage their supply chains. Now, it also sells tote bags. Last year, Palantir relaunched an online merchandise store, and its website was recently redesigned with a swanky interface and new payment system. A mock terminal in the lower left corner displays “code” documenting each item you view. A page titled “Core Capsule” displays an assortment of sold out items, like athletic shorts with text reading "PLTR—TECH" running down the right butt cheek, which sold for $99. It also shows a puffy “ergonomic" nylon tote bag that was priced at $119, and a Palantir baseball cap that ran for $55. The site is relaunching on Thursday evening with a new merch drop. Many companies produce branded swag for their employees and clients, including the legacy defense contractors that Palantir is trying to disrupt. Lockheed Martin sells a skunk stuffed animal, a nod to its R&D team that started secret operations under the name “Skunk Works” during World War II. Boeing sells T-shirts and keychains depicting various military aircraft, like its B-52 bomber jets and AH-64 attack helicopters. They’re products that may appeal to current or former employees, or their friends and family. But what Palantir is doing feels far more ambitious: The company seemingly wants to be a lifestyle brand. Eliano Younes—the company's head of strategic engagement, who runs the merch store and posts about it frequently on X—has been explicit about this in multiple posts. “Palantir is THE lifestyle brand,” Younes posted on X in March. “The most pro-west, meritocratic, winning obsessed, and based brand on the face of the earth.” But what does it mean for Palantir—a company that, in the words of one former employee, essentially sells digital “filing cabinets” to customers like Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the US Department of Defense, Heineken beer, and General Mills—to be a lifestyle brand? Lifestyle brands sell products that people buy to express their identities, whether they’re Tesla super fans, Zyn bros, or Hydroflask water bottle girlies. These brands aren’t necessarily successful because they have a superior product, but rather because they’re skilled at “proposing an original point of view” and “influencing a social context,” argues the book Lifestyle Brands, cowritten by management professor Stefania Saviolo and brand consultant Antonio Marazza. Using the products they sell is a symbolic act, a way to “to signal status” or demonstrate “a sense of belonging to a group.” Generally, lifestyle brands are known for products they sell to the public. People recognize Tesla as a company that sells cars, and Zyn as a company that sells nicotine pouches. To state the obvious, Palantir is not a clothing company. And the software it does sell is not consumer-facing. Its price tag is so large that, often, giant government agencies and corporations are the only ones that can afford it. Palantir is not exactly an obvious candidate for a lifestyle brand. And yet, despite the odds, Palantir has a fan base that includes many potential merch customers. Palantir bros are not hard to encounter online: There are several Palantir-focused subreddits, the largest of which has 109,000 members. Some people on X have been able to amass huge followings by posting exclusively about the company throughout the day. Palantir fans can obsessively focus on the company’s stock price. They can behave like American football fans when it goes up, celebrating as if their team scored a touchdown. When it gets a big contract, it’s as if their team got a new star player. In this context, it makes sense that people would want to purchase merch—it’s like buying a jersey. Palantir’s fan base gradually expanded during the years that contractors for immigration enforcement and the military were least popular in Silicon Valley. For fans, Palantir was a contrarian dark horse that stood by its principles, even though others detested them. For Palantir, becoming a lifestyle brand seems more about getting the company’s fans to publicly identify with its brand and its mission. This is made explicit on a white note card, with CEO Alex Karp’s signature, that was included with recent orders of Palantir merch. “Thank you for your dedication to Palantir and our mission to defend the West,” the card reads. “The future belongs to those who believe and build. And we build to dominate.” Younes has expressed a similar sentiment. “Palantir isn't just a software company,” he wrote on X in August. “It’s a world view—western values, pro-warfighter, problem solving, conviction, dominant software, etc. that’s why people rep the gear.” These values have not always been popular in Silicon Valley. In fact, historically, they’ve been outright rejected. In 2018, thousands of Google workers rallied against the company’s involvement in Project Maven, a Pentagon project analyzing drone footage with AI. Conceding to the workers, Google chose to not renew its Maven contract but said it wouldn’t stop working with the Pentagon. That same year, protests against Palantir were popping up in Palo Alto in response to the company’s work with ICE. (ICE did not cancel any contracts.) However, under the second Trump administration, the tech world is beginning to openly embrace aligning with the military—both transactionally, and symbolically. In June, the Army commissioned an elite group of tech executives to be “lieutenant colonels.” Palantir chief technology officer Shyam Sankar was joined by Meta chief technology officer Andrew Bosworth, OpenAI chief product officer Kevin Weil, and current Thinking Machines Lab adviser and former OpenAI chief research officer Bob McGrew, who also worked at Palantir. Palantir’s current merch store appears to capitalize on this vibe change and communicate that the company is doubling down on its reputation, branding, and mission. In an April letter to shareholders, Karp wrote that its mission “was for years dismissed as politically fraught and ill-advised.” “We, the heretics, this motley band of characters, were cast out and nearly discarded by Silicon Valley,” Karp wrote. “And yet there are signs that some within the Valley have now turned a corner and begun following our lead.” One of Palantir’s first merch releases was a black shirt with a giant red graphic. The oblong shape resembles an oval projection of the earth. There are three lines inside the oval that evoke latitude-longitude lines, or a wireframe globe. In the direct center, there’s the Palantir logo. Symbolically, it looks like Palantir is controlling the world. Ironically, one of the most common misconceptions about Palantir is that it’s one giant database with information from every single one of its clients. The company has published several blogs trying to dispel this myth on a factual basis. This shirt, by contrast, appears to take a different approach. It symbolically mocks, embraces, and dismisses this misconception. It seemingly was created with precisely Karp’s “heretics” in mind. At the core of Palantir’s merch identity is its insistence that all of the products are “Made in the U.S.A.” Like many other companies, Palantir wants to evoke a sense of pride in supporting American workers. But it’s very expensive to produce clothes made in the United States—especially ones with custom tags and high-quality materials, as the company claims. Palantir’s head of strategic development has said that the goal of the merch store, financially, is to simply break even. When the website relaunched, Younes blamed tariffs for the higher cost of the merchandise. “This will not be a new revenue stream,” he posted in May 2024. Simply put, Palantir doesn't have to do this. In fact, Palantir has actually tried and failed to run a merch store before. Archives of the old store show a simple white website with nondescript T-shirts and hats. At the time, some customers complained that they were cheaply made and unattractive. Palantir shut it down in 2023. Palantir isn’t alone. The defense tech company Anduril, which is known for embracing working with US immigration authorities early in its history, launched a “gear store” shortly after Palantir relaunched its own. It sells shiny black flight jackets, Hawaiian shirts (not unlike the ones CEO Palmer Luckey is known to sport), and T-shirts that say “workatanduril.com” in black sans serif text overlain with “DON’T” scrawled in black graffiti, seemingly in an attempt to look rebellious and cheeky. Like Palantir, the company is eager to note when its products are “Made in the USA.” WIRED was unable to independently confirm details about the production of Palantir and Anduril merch, including whether it was made in America, or which manufacturers they used. Neither company responded to a request for comment on the topic. Garments made in the US are typically made by immigrants, which make up more than 40 percent of the workforce. Many of them are undocumented, and can be compensated by tasks completed rather than being paid by the hour, which overwhelmingly adds up to far below the minimum wage. Palantir has been doing a lot of work for ICE under Trump 2.0. Since April, it has been building “ImmigrationOS,” a new system for the agency to, ideally, have “near real-time visibility” on people self-deporting. (Public documents are not clear about how ImmigrationOS would do this, or what data it would use.) ICE is paying Palantir $30 million to do this. Palantir is scheduled to provide ICE with a prototype of ImmigrationOS on September 25. On September 18, it released new merch.

Title: Fed Easing Cycle Resumes: Market Implications
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2025/09/21/fed-easing-cycle-resumes-market-implications/
Time Published: 2025-09-21T11:00:00Z

ByBill Stone, Contributor. Following the Federal Reserve rate cut last Wednesday, the S&P 500 closed at an all-time high last Friday. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), outperformed the market. As outlined previously, the Federal Reserve delivered a 25-basis-point cut at its September 17 meeting. The statement from the committee said, “downside risks to employment have risen,” which indicates that the recent softness in the monthly jobs reports has shifted the Fed back into easing mode after a nine-month hiatus. The median projections from the Fed call for 25-basis point cuts in October and December. Previously, the Fed only expected a cut at one of those meetings. Markets have also priced in at the October and December Fed meetings. Notably, the Fed’s increase in the number of median rate cuts was by a very narrow margin, so these cuts are far from a sure thing with incoming data remaining crucial. Both two-year and ten-year Treasury yields are well below their highs for the year. As the threat of recession has waned, as illustrated by the lower betting odds of recession, stocks have rallied. At the early April stock lows, the massive US tariffs announced on Liberation Day sent the betting odds of recession soaring to 65%. As the tariff threat eased and some progress was made on trade agreements, stocks have recovered sharply. Recession odds declined following the Fed rate cut announcement, and stocks reached a new all-time closing high. The more economically sensitive cyclical stocks outperformed less economically impacted defensives last week, and since the stocks bottomed in early April, coinciding with the peak of recession fears. The lessening of the odds of recession benefited the more economically sensitive stocks. Beyond this relationship, smaller capitalization stocks, using the Russell 2000 as an example, have outperformed recently. Furthermore, bank stocks have continued to outperform, benefiting from a better economic outlook and a steeper yield curve. The most direct beneficiaries of the rate cut are companies (and households) with floating-rate debt. Another transmission mechanism for lower short-term rates to positively impact the economy is the housing sector. As housing affordability hovers near all-time lows since 1989, part of the equation has been due to higher mortgage rates. This lack of affordability is most pronounced for first-time homebuyers. The expectation of a decline in short-term rates has led to the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage dropping from a high of 7.41% in January to 6.37% most recently. The US housing market has been limping along with a depressed level of new single-family home building. Permits for new single-family home construction show a similar poor outlook for home building. While mortgage applications for home purchases remain depressed, the trend has been moving higher since mortgage rates peaked. Notably, mortgage applications for refinancing have spiked with the lower mortgage rates. Importantly, this puts extra cash in the pockets of US households. Unfortunately, this refinancing cycle is likely to be less potent than previous cycles due to the significant amount of refinancing that occurred when rates were at ultra-low levels during the pandemic. There are only seven companies in the S&P 500 scheduled to report earnings, with Costco (COST) and Micron Technology (MU) being the most notable for their economic insights. There are a whopping eighteen speeches from Federal Reserve members scheduled for this week. This Fedspeak will be closely watched for clues as to the timing of future rate cuts, none more so than Fed Chair Powell’s speech on Tuesday. Stocks continue to price in low odds of recession, given the strong performance of small companies, banks, and the more economically sensitive cyclical stocks. The Fed’s cut last week, along with the expectation of two more cuts this year, reinforced the notion that the soft spot in the labor market will not develop into a full-fledged downturn. The positive boost from easing monetary policy is lagged and variable, so it will be imperative to monitor the impact to ascertain if it is consistent with market expectations. There is little doubt that lower rates will have less potency than in previous cycles and may come at a more significant lag, given the legacy of ultra-low interest rates during the pandemic. Disclosure: Glenview Trust may hold stocks mentioned in this article within its recommended investment strategies.

Title: Fears of a tech bubble have it backward. Stocks can keep going.

The stock market may be feeling a little bubbly, but it is nothing like the parabolic, internet-hyped tech trade of the late 1990s. Oracle’s near 40% one-day surge last week on a bullish forecast stirred up memories of that frothy period—and some concern about excess AI optimism. But there is a big difference between now and the stock market party of 1999: Companies now are making real money. Back then, “the price performance was insane," said Dan Greenhaus, strategist at Solus Alternative Asset Management. “Stocks were splitting multiple times a year because the appreciation was so great." “Everything was going public, whether they had any sales or not. There was a level of enthusiasm across markets and sectors that really doesn’t feel similar to today." Today’s major tech companies are pricey, but nowhere close to “dot-com bubble valuations," Greenhaus said. The bull market could run longer. Famously, former Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan used the term “irrational exuberance" to describe elevated asset prices in December 1996, years before the market peaked. Tech stocks tied to AI are benefiting from real impacts on their earnings. Market darling Nvidia “keeps going up in general, but it isn’t getting more expensive," Greenhaus said. The stock’s rise is driven by “extreme earnings and sales revisions," not just valuations, he said. Oracle’s big stock move came after the company reported an AI revenue forecast much stronger than the market expected. It now sees its cloud infrastructure revenue reaching $144 billion over the next four years, up from a projected $18 billion this fiscal year. The companies driving the market today “have so much excess cash flow that they’re buying back their stock," said Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock. “They can still spend on capital expenditure and research and development, and they still have plenty of money to buy back their stocks. That was the exact opposite of the tech bubble," Rieder said. Rieder said AI adoption is “an extraordinary expenditure that is changing the economic landscape" with the power to bring about huge gains in productivity. The breadth of the AI trade is also much greater than the internet and Y2K focused trade of the late 1990s and early 2000. Stocks that were considered “old economy" at the time traded with low valuations, while internet-related plays commanded sky high premiums. The market is treating AI innovation differently. Evercore ISI describes its influence on stocks as a “participatory democracy," with the potential to benefit the companies that create it, support it, and use it. AI can create winners across industries, well beyond tech. The firm notes that a quarter of companies are adopting AI just three years after the public launch of ChatGPT. During the last two years of the tech bubble, more stocks were going down daily than were rising, signaling a serious deterioration in the health of the market, according to Evercore ISI. That is opposite what is happening now, with more stocks advancing, taking indexes higher. The broader profit picture is also different. “Intel, Sun Micro, Cisco, Microsoft, the big guys were profitable then. It was the huge satellite of peripheral companies that weren’t profitable," Greenhaus said. Amazon, one of the tech heavyweights in the Magnificent 7, wasn’t profitable during the tech bubble. Its first quarterly profit was in 2021. “The best money wasn’t made on the companies that were building the internet. The best money was made on the companies that became the business because of the internet. Amazon, for instance," Greenhaus said. Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab, said she is seeing some signs of froth in the market. But she believes the bull market will continue. “When sentiment gets to the frothier end of the spectrum, that sentiment can last for a long time," said Sonders. While the Magnificent 7 stocks have fueled much of the gains in the S&P 500, the tech giants, including Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Meta, aren’t the biggest gainers in the stock market this year, she notes. Meta is the best performing Mag 7 stock in the S&P 500, but it is the 57th best performing stock in the S&P, while Alphabet was 58th, according to Schwab. Sonders said she currently isn’t recommending specific sectors, or even just high-quality stocks. She sees “opportunity a little bit down the quality spectrum into some of the more value-oriented areas, but you don’t want to sacrifice decent growth opportunities." She looks for factors like positive earnings revisions, positive earnings surprises, low price-to-book, low-price-to-sales, and amount of free cash flow. Some strategists have been expecting a correction to tamp down some of the market’s enthusiasm. Sonders said there has been a rolling correction across the market. She notes the S&P 500 was down 19% at its low point this year, while at the average member level, the drawdown was 25% from the year-to-date highs. The S&P quickly recovered and went on to set new highs. Sonders said the biggest gainers of the Nasdaq currently include small, lesser-known stocks. “There are retail traders’ fingerprints all over this market move. They are sort of full steam ahead—and they buy the dip, buy every little dip. And so at some point you could argue, the music ends. But it could last awhile."

Title:  Is AI a bubble? - by Azeem Azhar and Nathan Warren
URL: https://www.exponentialview.co/p/is-ai-a-bubble
Time Published: 2025-09-21T05:47:01Z
Full Content:
A month ago, I set out to answer a deceptively simple question: Is AI a bubble? Since 2024, people have been asking me this as I’ve spoken at events around the world. Even as Wall Street bankers largely see this as an investment boom, more people are asking the question in meeting rooms and conference halls in Europe and the US. Some have made up their minds. Gary Marcus called it a “peak bubble.” The Atlantic warns that there is a “possibility that we’re currently experiencing an AI bubble, in which investor excitement has gotten too far ahead of the technology’s near-term productivity benefits. If that bubble bursts, it could put the dot-com crash to shame – and the tech giants and their Silicon Valley backers won’t be the only ones who suffer.” The Economist said that “the potential cost has risen alarmingly high.” The best way to understand a question like this is to create a framework, one that you can update as new evidence emerges. Putting this together has taken dozens of hours of data analysis, modeling and numerous conversations with investors and executives. This essay is that framework: five gauges to weigh genAI against history’s bubbles. I studied and lived through the dot-com bubble. I was an investor and felt its effects firsthand.1 Like many of you, I was also active during the Global Financial Crisis. For this reason, I’ve invested considerable thought and analysis into a robust framework to understand what’s going on. I’ll share it with you today. My thinking is grounded in the study of Carlota Perez, Bill Janeway and other giants in the field, as well as financial analyses of major banks and analysts. But what I haven’t seen anywhere else is a framework that translates those theories into a practical dashboard for AI today: a set of parameters you can read, compare across past bubbles and use to orient your decisions. We will make the underlying data and methodology available to members of Exponential View in the coming weeks. I usually reserve my deep dives for paying members of Exponential View. But this question is too important, and the public debate clouded by posturing, for me to keep it behind a paywall. So today’s piece is free for everyone to read. If you want to access this analysis as a PDF, you can download it here. If you are an investor or executive navigating these questions, I am opening a very limited number of consultation sessions to work directly on them. This is a bespoke opportunity to stress-test your strategy with the same analytical framework I’ve developed. You can apply here. Bubbles are among the oldest stories of capitalism. They’re parables of excess, belief and collapse. But bubbles are not just financial phenomena; they are cultural artifacts. They return again and again as morality tales about greed and folly. Tulip mania, often misremembered as a frenzy of bankrupt weavers and drowning merchants, was less disastrous than legend suggests. It was confined to wealthy merchants and left the Dutch economy largely unscathed. But the myth has endured, and that is the point: bubbles become stories we tell ourselves about the dangers of optimism. Some bubbles are financial: the South Sea frenzy of the 1720s, the roaring stock market of the 1920s, Japan’s real-estate boom in the 1980s and the housing crash of 2008.2 Some are technological. In the 1840s, railways were hailed as the veins of a new industrial body. They were. But a body needs only so many veins, and tracks were soon laid in places commerce could not sustain. Telecoms in the 1990s promised a wired utopia, only for 70 million miles of excess fiber to lie dark underground. The dot-com boom gave us visions of a new economy, much of which did eventually materialize, but not before valuations evaporated in 2000. The funny thing is that there doesn’t seem to be an academic consensus on what an investment bubble is. Nobel laureate in economics Eugene Fama has gone so far as to say they don’t exist. I want to go beyond the notion that we know a bubble when we see a bubble. There are two interrelated systems at work. The first, the most visible, is when stock markets become absurdly overvalued and collapse. The second is whether the quantity of productive capital (going into capital expenditure or venture capital) deployed collapses. The two are related, of course. A collapse in equity prices makes investment flows more expensive. And a secular decline in productive capital investment may be read by equity markets as a harbinger of a slowdown. But to frame this: we see a bubble as being a 50% drawdown from the peak equity value that is sustained for at least five years. In the case of the US housing bubble and the dot-com, that trough was roughly five years long. Full recovery to pre-bubble peaks took 10 years for US housing, and 15 for the dot-com. Alongside, we would expect a substantial decline in the rate of productive capital deployed, once again 50% from peak. For the purposes of this analysis, by “bubble” I’ll address both of those competing dimensions. Ultimately, it means a phase marked by a rapid escalation in prices and investment, where valuations drift materially away from the underlying prospects and realistic earnings power of the assets involved. Bubbles thrive on abundant capital and seductive narratives, and they tend to end in a sharp and sustained reversal that wipes out much of the paper wealth created on the way up. A “boom,” by contrast, can look very similar in its early stages with rising valuations and accelerating investment. But the crucial distinction is that, in a boom, fundamentals eventually catch up. The underlying cash flows, productivity gains, or genuine demand growth rise to meet the optimism. Booms can still overshoot, but they consolidate into durable industries and lasting economic value. Between the two lies a gray zone: periods of exuberance when it is genuinely hard to tell whether capital is building the foundations of a new economy or merely inflating prices that will not be sustained. It’s like being in the eye of a storm: you can feel the wind, rain and pressure, but you don’t yet know whether it will clear the air or flatten the house. This brings us to the present question: is AI another bubble? What unsettles many observers are the numbers. Since ChatGPT’s release in late 2022, hyperscalers have more than doubled their annual data center capex, betting heavily on the infrastructure needed to train and run ever-larger models. When Sam Altman floated a $7 trillion investment requirement last year, it sounded like hubris. Today, investors aren’t laughing; they’re wondering whether the scale of spending is sustainable. Bubbles are impossible to diagnose in real time. Only in retrospect do we know whether exuberance was justified or delusional. Rather than making a definitive call — which borders on unhelpful speculation — it’s better to benchmark today’s boom against history to spot where bubble-like dynamics may be creeping in. We’re thinking of this as flying a plane. Pilots don’t rely on a single instrument. They monitor a cluster of gauges to understand how the flight is going. We’ll use five of them here: Gauge 1 – Economic strain: Is investment now large enough to bend the economy? Gauge 2 – Industry strain: Are industry revenues commensurate with the deployed capex? Gauge 3 – Revenue growth: Is revenue rising/broadening fast enough to catch up? Gauge 4 – Valuation heat: How hot are valuations? Compared to history, are stocks excessively overpriced? Gauge 5 – Funding quality: What kind of money is funding this? Is it strong balance sheets, or fragile, flighty capital? In the rest of the essay, I look at each gauge to explain why it may be green, amber or red, and at the end I pull them together into a full dashboard view. The investment underway is vast, with Morgan Stanley expecting $3 trillion in AI infrastructure spend by 2029. But it has not yet reached the runaway extremes of history’s great blowouts. What makes this dimension tricky is dependence. In the US, more than a third of GDP growth can be traced to data center construction. This is not inherently bad, but it may be dangerous if the momentum falters. An economy leaning this heavily on one sector for growth can find the ground falling away faster than expected. The surge of capital expenditure (capex), poured into the physical infrastructure that AI demands, is an act of optimism. This is what capex is. Money spent today in the belief that it will become a funnel of revenue tomorrow. If it’s well-placed today, it will eventually lead to productivity gains and economic expansion. If you want to sell people hula hoops to promote their health and happiness, you need to buy hula hoops first. And somewhere down the line, there needs to be a factory making them. Funding that factory is capex. You deploy the capex to build a useful thing that you can sell. Capex investment is often, but not always, a precursor to a growing business. AI data centers have a similar quality, and something more. They are not just factories for a single product; they are infrastructure. Microsoft, OpenAI and the US government all see it this way. They see compute as a foundational utility of the 21st century, no less critical than highways, railways, power grids or telecom networks were in earlier eras. I made the same argument in my last book, so you can guess where I stand. Excluding the US, sovereign governments have made more than $1 trillion in commitments to AI as infrastructure by 2030. To build such infrastructure inevitably requires historic sums, on a par with the railway and electricity build-outs of the past. McKinsey projects that meeting AI-driven demand by 2030 will require around 156 GW of new electrical capacity — the size of Spain’s and Portugal’s grids combined. The firm estimates this will cost $5-7.9 trillion in capital spending. For context, this is about twenty times the cost of the Apollo missions. This would place AI data centers among the largest infrastructure build-outs in modern history. But useful though infrastructure is, especially when private capital gets involved, things can get divorced from reality. The financing structure matters as much as the technology itself. The railways in the US were largely privately funded and suffered from multiple investment bubbles. Electricity and road systems, by contrast, benefited from greater public investment and coordination, and were less prone to speculative excess. A boom becomes dangerous when the resources it demands start to bend the whole economy around it. Wages get sucked into one sector, supply chains reorient to serve it and capital markets grow dependent on it. The snapback is vicious when expectations break. One way to gauge the economic strain is to look at investment as a share of GDP, the portion of national output funneled into a single technological frontier. It is a crude but telling ratio. It shows how heavily the economy leans on one technological bet. In the case of AI infrastructure, most of that spending takes the form of capital expenditures: the servers, cooling systems, networking gear, shells of concrete and steel and the power infrastructure required to keep them running. By that measure, the railway bubbles were the heaviest. In the United States, railway spending peaked at around 4% of GDP in 1872, just before the first great crash. The telecom boom of the late 1990s, by contrast, topped out near 1% of GDP, a level that looks familiar today. The AI build-out sits in this middle zone. Around $370 billion is expected to flow into data centers globally in 2025, with perhaps 70% earmarked for the US,3 or roughly 0.9% of American GDP. Goldman Sachs projects spending will climb by another 17% in 2026. My own forecasts are in line with this view: annual capex of $800 billion by 2030, perhaps 60% in the US, which would bring the American share to 1.6% of 2025 GDP. The economic-strain gauge has three segments: green up to 1%, amber up to 2% and red above 2%. So today, genAI sits in the green zone – just. Of course, given stated commitments, it looks like it’ll head into amber soon. But there is a twist here that history’s bubbles did not face: rapid depreciation. Once laid, a railway track could last decades. The US was still running freight over 19th-century tracks well into the 20th. Telecom fiber rolled out in the 1990s still carries traffic 35 years later. GPUs, by contrast, age in dog years. Their useful life for frontier applications such as model training is perhaps three years, after which they are relegated to lower-intensity tasks. Roughly a third of hyperscaler capex is going into such short-lived assets. They remain, in theory, monetizable in years five and six. The rest goes into shells, power and cooling that last two or three decades. Adjusting for asset life makes the AI build-out look even more demanding: unlike railroads or fiber, the system must earn its keep in a handful of years, not generations. Whether this dynamic makes financial conditions worse or better is an open question. The pessimistic view is that a box of ripe bananas is worth less than the same value of Brazil nuts, because it must be consumed quickly. But the optimistic case is intriguing: shorter depreciation cycles may impose financial discipline on incoming investors. During the railway mania, decades-long asset lives masked the weakness of many business models; companies could stagger on for years before insolvency. In AI, the flaws may surface quickly, forcing either rapid adaptation or rapid failure. The strain is noticeable but not yet unbearable. Venture funding at the AI application layer, while noisy, remains modest compared with the telecom mania of the 1990s.4 That suggests there may still be running room before the cycle overheats. The trillions pouring into servers, cooling systems and power lines may be essential, but history suggests they are not where the enduring profits accumulate. In railways, many track companies went bust, but the logistics firms and commodity barons riding their lines prospered. In telecoms, it was not the builders of fiber who captured the upside but the platforms and service providers that used the bandwidth. The same logic may apply to AI: hyperscalers shoulder the capex burden, but the durable value may accrue to those who control the models, the data and the ecosystems built on top. This brings us to the second gauge on the dashboard: industry strain. Every boom needs to prove that the money poured into new equipment is starting to earn its keep. In any growth stage, it is unlikely that revenues will cover investment, but they should be non-zero. This gauge looks at the ratio of capex to revenues. We estimate that genAI revenues look on track to exceed $60 billion this year, from roughly nil five years ago.5 This number could well undercount the value being generated by genAI. Meta, for example, has suggested that the technology has increased conversions on its platforms by about 3–5%. Indirect effects like this may help explain why some analysts, such as Morgan Stanley, peg 2025 revenues far higher than our estimate, at $153 billion. The big hyperscalers, such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon, are without doubt moving into a phase of higher capex intensity. In 2021, before ChatGPT, hyperscalers invested about 44% of their operating cash flow in capex. By 2024, that had risen to 68%. In 2025, it will be higher still. But, as Pierre Ferragu of New Street Research points out, these firms can absorb this shift by replatforming, with structurally higher capital intensity driving growth and efficiency gains. This dynamic has been in place for a decade already: between 2015 and 2018, Microsoft Azure’s capex represented between 70% and 90% of revenues. It was an investment in the future. This makes for an interesting comparison to earlier boom cycles. The railroads are particularly pertinent. The railroads’ direct revenue contribution was tiny compared to the value the railroads created in the US economy. Railway bubbles were always tethered to the reality of cash flow. The bonds issued to finance new track and rolling stock had to be serviced out of passenger fares and freight revenues. Whenever capex outpaced earnings, the strain showed. The manias of 1873, 1883 and 1887 all followed the same pattern: a sharp decline in the ratio of annual revenues to capital spending, and in some cases, outright revenue contraction. At the height of the US railroad expansion in 1872, capex was around two times revenues. In the late-1990s telecom bubble, capex amounted to just under four times revenues. By contrast, today’s genAI boom runs on roughly $60 billion in revenues against about $370 billion in global data center capex – a capex-to-revenue ratio of six times, the most stretched of the three.6 On the industry-strain gauge, railways sat healthily in the green. GenAI is in amber, nearing red. It’s not quite a warning sign, not least because genAI has people clamoring for access to AI data centers. One report suggests that enterprise customers are committing to capacity before data centers are even built. What is driving that is usage, and with that comes astonishing revenue growth. The problem in the railroad and telecom booms was not sector strain per se, but that revenues ran out of momentum. Investment expects a return. After the railway bubble burst in 1873, revenue declined by 3% year over year. Telecoms did slightly better, declining 0.5%. Before the crashes, revenue growth was hardly explosive. Railways in 1873 expanded 22% – enough to double in three years. Telecom in the late 1990s managed only 16%, a doubling time of just over four years. By contrast, genAI revenues are still accelerating. By our estimates, genAI revenues will grow about twofold this year.7 And this is likely a conservative forecast. Citi estimates that model makers’ revenue will grow 483% in 2025. OpenAI forecasts annualized growth of about 73% to 2030, while analysts like Morgan Stanley estimate this market could be as large as $1 trillion by 2028, equivalent to compound growth of ~122% a year over the period. Our revenue growth gauge is an exponential one. It measures revenue doubling time in years; that is, at current growth rates, how long does it take for sector revenue to double? Here, genAI sits squarely in the green, doubling every year. Much of this spending flows down to the hyperscalers and neoclouds that run the infrastructure. Hyperscalers make tons of money, so they can afford to invest, trimming a few points off earnings if they think it positions them well for the future. Oracle projects that its cloud business could generate around $380 billion in cumulative revenues by 2030. In my conversations with large companies, I get the strong sense that they can’t get enough of this technology right now. And this likely supports the strong growth rates. IBM’s CEO survey shows that genAI is already expanding IT budgets, with 62% of respondents indicating they will increase their AI investments in 2025. Demand is so high that new data centers are at full utilization as soon as they come online, with Amazon CEO Andy Jassy noting that “as fast as we put the capacity in, it’s being consumed” and Sam Altman remarking that a lack of compute was affecting model upgrades. Jensen Huang expected this would happen early in 2024, predicting that demand for both Hopper and Blackwell chips would outstrip supply well into next year. Some 9% of US firms have one useful genAI use case. Back-of-the-napkin math suggests that 9% will become 75% within five years, and the number of use cases will rise from one to hundreds.8 That on its own points to a thousandfold increase in something. I say *something* because the current billing-by-token model may change.9 Even if it doesn’t, we’ll see dramatic price declines on per-token pricing, likely by orders of magnitude. The underlying point is that we are still at the foothills of enterprise use. For now, firms can barely secure enough tokens to meet their needs. The consumer side tells a parallel story. US consumers already spend about $1.4 trillion a year online. This could plausibly double to $3 trillion by 2030 if it grows at 15–17% a year (it has grown at more than 14% a year since 2013). Against this backdrop, a genAI app sector rising from today’s $10 billion to $500 billion within five years looks less far-fetched. Exponential growth rates of 300-500% are already visible in mid-sized startups and the large model providers (see last week’s essay on OpenAI’s valuation), suggesting that even a small reallocation of consumer digital spending could drive revenues into the hundreds of billions. Taken together, these signals point to an industry still in strong ascent, unlike the relatively meager revenue growth that preceded the railroad and telecom busts. If genAI revenues were to grow at even half the pace of last year, then, on my conservative forecast, they would reach $100 billion by 2026, covering about 25% of that year’s capex. If economic and industry strain show the weight of the boom and revenue growth its trajectory, valuation heat is the mood of the market. This is often where bubbles reveal themselves most clearly: how exuberantly investors are pricing the sector, regardless of fundamentals. As Carlota Perez has argued for decades, financial markets tend to overshoot in the early “installation phase” of each technological revolution, pouring in capital far beyond what near-term revenues justify. The frenzy looks irrational in the moment, but it is the mechanism by which society lays down the new infrastructure. The challenge is whether the frenzy can evolve into the “deployment phase,” when the infrastructure becomes universal and delivers real productivity gains. The dot-com bubble is the archetype. Companies with no profits at all floated at triple-digit multiples, some raising more on IPO day than they would ever earn in revenues. Boo.com raised $135 million from investors, including LVMH’s Bernard Arnault, and pitched itself as the “Amazon of fashion.” The site launched in 18 countries with localized language and shipping, with a virtual avatar, “Miss Boo,” who gave shopping tips on 3D models. It spent $25 million on advertising before launch, ballooned staff from 40 to 400, and opened plush offices across New York and Europe. The JavaScript- and Flash-heavy website was nearly unusable on dial-up connections, incompatible with Mac computers and buggy. One in four attempted purchases failed. Despite the extravagance – lavish parties, Concorde flights and celebrity stylists for Miss Boo – polls showed that just 13% of internet users knew the brand existed. Within 18 months, the money was gone. Boo.com collapsed in May 2000.10 What’s going on in genAI does not compare to this. The key measure here is the price/earnings ratio (P/E), a shorthand for how many years of current profits an investor is effectively paying for. If a company has $1 in annual earnings and trades at a P/E of 20, buyers are paying $20 for each dollar of current profit, assuming growth will make that worthwhile. A high P/E means companies are betting on rapid future growth, but too high, for too long, investors might be buying into a fantasy. This was the case in the dot-com era. At the peak, the Nasdaq traded at a P/E of about 72. One detailed study estimated that internet stocks alone carried an implied P/E of 605. In other words, investors were willing to pay for more than six centuries of current earnings. The issue wasn’t that demand disappeared – Amazon’s revenues grew from $2.76 billion in 2000 to $3.12 billion in 2001 – but that no company could grow fast enough to justify those sky-high expectations. The fundamentals improved, but expectations collapsed. Today, the picture is much calmer. The Nasdaq P/E is about 32, half that of the dot-com era. The broader tech market is higher than the long-run average, but nowhere near dot-com territory. Compared to the railroad bubbles, which had an estimated P/E of around 20, it is high. But the railroads ended badly, not because valuations were extreme in themselves, but because revenue growth faltered. By contrast, genAI revenues are still accelerating rapidly. Another indicator of valuation excess that many investors pay attention to is the so-called “Buffett Indicator”, which measures how far ahead of GDP equity market valuations have risen. There is no doubt that this indicator is peaky, well above a two-standard-deviation anomaly that often presages market corrections. We are more sanguine, for the moment. History rhymes; it doesn’t repeat. The Buffett indicator relies on GDP, and GDP is famously bad at capturing technological productivity gains. In addition, a large portion of big tech revenues comes from outside the US, decoupling their earnings from domestic GDP. Finally, AI-based productivity may affect margins – keeping output (and GDP constant), while increasing corporate profits. So while we keep an eye on the Buffett indicator (and its distant cousin, the Shiller CAPE ratio), we feel the different dynamics of an accelerating digital economy are not well captured by them. So how hot is this gauge? My verdict is green. Prices haven’t yet broken free of gravity in the way dot-com valuations did. Funding quality is not a standard metric but a composite judgment. It asks who the money is coming from, how it is structured and whether the capital is willing to wait years for returns or rather chase quarterly pops. Low-quality capital, in short, is short-termist, undisciplined and debt-laden; it rushes and flees quickly. High-quality capital is more patient, better underwritten, and able to withstand volatility. Every bubble has its signature weakness, invariably rooted in how it was financed. Railways were fueled by speculative retail investors with little capital behind them. By the early 1870s, funded debt averaged 46% of total assets among American railroads; when overbuilding met a credit squeeze, financing evaporated. The Panic of 1873 sent rail lines into receivership. Dot-com firms, a century later, were a little sturdier. Venture capital was a boutique business in 1995, with only $5.3 billion deployed. By 2001, more than $237 billion had been poured into startups, often by new and inexperienced managers. The frenzy spilled into public markets: IPO volume between 1999 and 2000 ran six times above historical averages. Companies went public with little revenue. Two of my friends took theGlobe.com public in 1998 and enjoyed a 606% share-price pop the day they went public. Telecoms in the late 1990s leaned on mountains of cheap debt. US and European carriers doubled and quadrupled their leverage in just a few years. Deutsche Telekom and France Télécom together added $78 billion in net debt between 1998 and 2001. When revenues failed to keep pace, defaults rippled through the sector. In each case, the capital that fueled the boom proved ephemeral. But the degree of fragility differed. Railways and telecoms were most exposed to credit crunches, with debt ratios ballooning. Dot-coms were hostage to market mood, with equity values evaporating. On this front, today’s AI boom looks sturdier. Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta and Nvidia are minting extraordinary cash flows, easily enough to bankroll their own build-out. For now. But investment needs are racing ahead. Morgan Stanley reckons total global data center capex will hit $2.9 trillion between 2025 and 2028. Hyperscalers can cover perhaps half of that from internal cash. The rest must come from private credit, securitized finance and new operators. Governments have also pledged $1.6 trillion in sovereign AI investments, and Gulf capital is seeking new opportunities. Here is where the risks creep in. Morgan Stanley itself points to a $1.5 trillion gap that will need to be plugged by debt markets and asset-backed securities. The sums are enormous: $800 billion from private credit, $150 billion in data center ABS,11 and hundreds of billions more in OEM loans and vendor financing.12 That $150 billion alone would triple the size of the data-center securitized markets almost overnight. And not every borrower looks like Microsoft. Consider CoreWeave, an Nvidia-backed upstart now going public with $8 billion of debt. It has already slipped into technical default on loans, missing covenants without being insolvent, and its revenues depend on just two customers. Its economics rest on renting GPUs that depreciate by 20–30% per year, more like a WeWork lease than a hyperscaler’s durable balance sheet. In other words, the foundation is stronger than in past bubbles, but the superstructure is starting to resemble the old pattern. Esoteric debt structures, concentrated counterparties and hardware that may not hold value are reappearing. If genAI revenues grow tenfold, creditors will be fine. If not, they may discover that a warehouse full of obsolete GPUs is a difficult thing to secure. For now, my gauge is greenish. We’re not yet in bubble territory, but if financing keeps creeping this way over the next year without revenue growth as robust as 2025’s, it might tick over to amber. On the basis of these gauges, genAI remains in a demand-led, capital-intensive boom rather than a bubble. But booms can sour quickly, and there are several pressure points worth watching: If investment climbs toward 2% of GDP, it could suggest the economy is overweighting AI relative to its productivity returns; equally, if one or more hyperscalers were to cut capex by more than a fifth over the next three to five years, that would mark a sharp turn in sentiment that could trigger a rapid decline among other players. A sustained fall in current enterprise and consumer spending levels would be another warning, especially if foreshadowed by a shrinking Nvidia order backlog. At the same time, the economics need to improve: revenues per dollar of capital should move toward the 0.5–1.0 range. Should the gap fail to close, it would imply that scale is not delivering the expected efficiencies. If valuations start approaching a P/E ratio of 50-60, it would look frothy, since a genuine growth phase should see earnings catching up with prices, not lagging further behind. If internal cash covers less than 25% of capex, data center investment stability comes under pressure. Right now, stability comes from hyperscalers’ strong cash flows. If they stop covering the majority of capex, then more debt and securitization will creep in. Not great given a GPU’s depreciation cycle. If internal funding slips below a quarter of new capex and reliance shifts toward debt and securitization, the sector’s dependence on short-lived GPUs and its exposure to higher interest rates could quickly become destabilizing. My current heuristic is that if two of the five gauges head into red, you’re in bubble territory. Time to sell up, buy the VIX and take some deep breaths. In the year prior to the Panic of 1873, the railroad’s economic strain turned red, accompanied by a decline in funding quality. Anemic revenue growth didn’t help. With the telecoms crash of 2001, revenue growth and funding quality blared red. In the dot-com era, it was industry investment strain and valuations. GenAI isn’t there yet. Racing fast, the engine is whining, but not overheating. How long would it take for two gauges to get into the red? I’ve toyed around with combinations, and most scary scenarios take a couple of years to play out. (And not all scenarios are scary.) That said, so many macro factors, from a recession in the US, to rising inflation, a challenging interest-rate environment, and domestic or international politics, could dampen spirits. While we might not be solidly in bubbleland, it would be hubristic to assume the AI investment cycle is immune to those exuberant dynamics. Onward. For now. Share I even wrote a blurb on the 1999 book The Internet Bubble. Edward Chancellor’s book on bubbles is a useful guide. Last year, SemiAnalysis forecast that around 70% of data center capacity build-out will happen in the US over the medium term. Adjusted for inflation, VC investment in the internet in 2000 was $85.9 billion; Dealroom.co reports $47 billion for the AI application layer last year – a difference of $38.9 billion. Revenues are compiled from primary corporate disclosures (SEC filings, earnings transcripts, investor presentations, press releases) and supplemented by analyst and consultancy estimates (McKinsey, Gartner, IDC, etc.) where company reporting is incomplete. We prioritize disclosed figures, adjust for potential double-counting in revenue-sharing agreements (e.g., OpenAI–Microsoft), and categorize revenue streams (subscription, API, infrastructure, licensing) to maintain comparability. Private-company revenues (e.g., Anthropic, Midjourney) rely on reported run-rates or credible press/VC sources, flagged as estimates. See previous footnote for genAI revenue model. Railroads calculated from FRED data and telecoms from OECD data on US leased line revenues. Our model shows 130% growth among AI companies year over year. Starting from about six million US firms, assume 9% (about 540,000) now have one useful genAI use case; project adoption to 75% (about 4.5 million) within five years, and average use cases per adopting firm to rise from about 1 to about 100 – yielding roughly 450 million use cases, an increase of about 830 times; illustrative, not a forecast. Most genAI services today are billed “by the token.” A token is a unit of text, usually about four characters or ¾ of a word. Customers are charged for tokens processed in prompts and responses (for example, a 1,000-word output might equal ~1,300 tokens). This model directly links cost to usage, but it may evolve as enterprises negotiate flat-rate contracts, consumption bundles, or outcome-based pricing. I spent an afternoon walking through Boo’s deserted offices after the collapse to see if any physical assets retained value. Asset-backed securities are bonds sold to investors, backed by cash flows from a pool of underlying assets. In this case, the assets are data center leases or infrastructure contracts, allowing operators to raise capital by securitizing predictable rental or service revenues. OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) such as Dell, Cisco or Nvidia often extend credit to customers or partner with financing arms to help them buy hardware. Vendor financing is the broader term for suppliers lending to buyers, typically repaid out of the revenues generated from using the purchased equipment. First of all, thanks for the reference to my work in your thoughtful, balanced and all but comprehensive analysis. There is one further aspect of these transformational technologies that are deployed as network-based services. This is the pricing dynamics when (a) the ability to deliver the first unit of service requires very large capital investment and (2) the marginal cost of delivering incremental units of services is very low. Then, marginal cost will be below average cost and – under competitive conditions – price will tend to be driven towards marginal cost. The result, of course, is negative cash flow for all competitors which, in turn, incentivizes some mix of regulatory intervention to protect the competitors from each other (ICC, PUCs) and evolution towards oligopoly/monopoly. I gather that inklings of these dynamics can be seen in the decline of cost/price per token. I am very interested in your take on this issue when it comes to roll out of the foundational models at increasing scale. -- Bill Janeway You certainly are right to mobilize demand elasticity as the counter MC<AC. But token cost is not the full cost of AI deployment. Given the probabilistic nature of the LLM token-prediction process, applications will vary by the intensity of the need for human supervision, debugging, etc. I don’t know how representative this RCT was, but it did strike me as suggesting a somewhat more complicated scenario: https://metr.org/blog/2025-07-10-early-2025-ai-experienced-os-dev-study/ .

Join thousands of innovation leaders getting weekly insights Why James Mackintosh's defense of quarterly reporting ignores what actually happens in corporate boardrooms. James Mackintosh's recent Wall Street Journal piece defending quarterly earnings reporting reads like a textbook example of why academic analysis often misses the mark when it comes to understanding corporate behavior. As someone who lived this reality for years as Chief Technology Officer at Hewlett-Packard—the world's largest technology company at the time by revenue with massive R&D investments—I can tell you the quarterly reporting system creates perverse incentives that systematically undermine long-term innovation. Mackintosh's central argument rests on flawed premises and cherry-picked data that ignore the lived experience of corporate executives who actually make investment decisions under quarterly pressure. His dismissal misses a critical opportunity to address one of America's most significant competitive disadvantages. Let me share what quarterly reporting actually looks like from the inside. During my tenure as CTO at HP, I experienced how quarterly pressure created systematic patterns across the industry where R&D would be paused, or delayed during quarter-end periods. This became a predictable cycle that repeated quarter after quarter. This behavior wasn’t unique to HP. It's the inevitable result of a system that rewards short-term financial engineering over patient capital investment. When your stock price can swing dramatically based on missing earnings by a few cents per share, the rational response is to optimize for quarterly performance, even at the expense of long-term competitiveness. The academic research Mackintosh cites, including MIT's Robert Pozen's study of UK reporting changes, fundamentally misunderstands how corporate behavior evolves. These researchers have never sat in a boardroom where directors debate whether to continue funding a multi-year innovation project that won't generate revenue for 36 months while facing pressure to meet next quarter's numbers. They've never experienced the intense scrutiny from analysts who penalize any hint of reduced short-term profitability. Through my relationship with Alex Mandl—my former boss at Teligent who led the board negotiations to take Dell private—I witnessed the most compelling modern example. Michael Dell and Silver Lake paid $24.9 billion for one thing—freedom from the quarterly earnings pressure that was killing Dell Technologies long-term potential. Dell explicitly stated the goal was "no more pulling R&D and growth investments to make in-quarter numbers." R&D spending increased from $1.1 billion to $4.4 billion, transforming Dell from declining PC manufacturer to enterprise solutions leader. The result: an estimated $70 billion return by 2023. This wasn't theoretical—it was a $25 billion bet that quarterly reporting pressure was destroying long-term value. And they were proven spectacularly right. Mackintosh's reliance on the UK's 2014 experience with optional quarterly reporting reveals a critical flaw in his reasoning. He argues that because UK companies didn't dramatically change their investment behavior after switching to semi-annual reporting, quarterly reporting must not be problematic. This ignores a fundamental truth: we've trained an entire generation of CEOs, CFOs, and board members to think in 90-day cycles. You don't undo decades of conditioning overnight. When business schools teach earnings management, when compensation systems reward quarterly performance, and when analysts' careers depend on predicting short-term results, making reporting optional doesn't suddenly transform corporate culture. The UK comparison is meaningless without addressing the broader ecosystem that reinforces short-term thinking. Mackintosh points to Big Tech's massive AI investments as proof that quarterly reporting doesn't hinder long-term thinking. This argument reveals a profound misunderstanding of competitive dynamics. Companies like Google, Microsoft, and Meta can hide enormous R&D expenditures within their massive profit margins. When you're generating 20-30% operating margins on hundreds of billions in revenue, you can afford to invest $50 billion in speculative technologies while still meeting quarterly expectations. But what about companies in lower-margin industries? What about manufacturing firms, healthcare companies, or emerging technology businesses that can't disguise innovation investments as easily? The current system creates a two-tier economy where only the most profitable companies can afford to think long-term, while everyone else gets trapped in quarterly optimization cycles. America's competitive advantage has always been rooted in our ability to make patient, long-term investments in breakthrough technologies. The semiconductor industry, the internet, biotechnology, and countless other innovations emerged from companies willing to invest for decades before seeing returns. Today's quarterly reporting regime systematically discourages this kind of "patient innovation." I've written extensively about the concept of the "50-year overnight success"—the reality that truly transformative innovations require sustained investment over multiple decades. Companies need the freedom to pursue breakthrough technologies without explaining every quarter why they're spending money on projects that won't generate revenue for years. Do I think switching from quarterly to semi-annual reporting solves the problem? No. Six months isn't meaningfully different from three months when it comes to long-term thinking. But we can make meaningful reforms that would help: First, eliminate forward-looking earnings guidance. This practice forces companies to make public commitments about future performance, creating enormous pressure to meet those predictions regardless of changing circumstances. Second, create accounting treatments that allow companies to separate long-term innovation investments from operational expenses, giving investors clearer visibility into both current performance and future potential. Third, develop new metrics and incentives that reward patient capital deployment and long-term value creation, not just quarterly financial performance. This isn't an abstract policy debate—it's about America's economic future. While we optimize for quarterly performance, competitors in China and other nations are making massive, sustained investments in critical technologies. Their state-directed approach has significant flaws, as Mackintosh correctly notes, but at least they're thinking in decade-long time horizons. We need American companies to have the same freedom to pursue patient innovation without facing quarterly punishment from investors and analysts who fundamentally misunderstand the innovation process. Academic researchers and financial journalists can theorize all they want about efficient markets and rational behavior. Those of us who've actually run large corporations know better. The quarterly reporting system is broken, and defending it based on theoretical models and incomplete data serves no one except those who profit from short-term volatility. Next time the Wall Street Journal wants to analyze corporate behavior, perhaps they should talk to someone who's actually lived it. The American economy deserves better than academic theory masquerading as practical wisdom.

Title: One Big Beautiful Bubble: Oracle, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Meta Platforms, Palantir et al in the danger zone?

Compare this to a single stock – Oracle Corporation adding $255 billion to its market cap within few hours on September 10! The message from investors is clear: The AI mania is running up and strong. The software giant grabbed headlines when its shares gained 36 per cent on September 10. With this massive move up, the stock added over $255 billion to its market cap – joining the exclusive club of stocks that have gained $250 billion or more in a single day. Other members of the coveted club are Nvidia, Apple and Microsoft. What triggered this euphoria in Oracle shares? The company had reported results for Q1 FY26 on September 9 after market close. However, it wasn’t earnings that pleased the street. While its net profit came in line with expectations, revenue reported a slight miss. What, in fact, surprised the street was the company’s grand plans for scaling up its cloud infrastructure business, a whopping 14 times by FY30 – from $10.2 billion in revenue in FY25 to $144 billion. In other words, this is a compounded growth rate of 70 per cent between FY25 and FY30. As the AI race continues full steam, it appears Oracle doesn’t want to be left behind. With large language models (LLMs) being built and upgraded left, right and centre, there is heavy demand for data centres that have the compute (processing power) to support this. This is exactly where Oracle and its cloud infrastructure business come in. The company offers cloud-based compute, storage and networking services to clients. Simply put, clients can make use of Oracle’s high-performance cloud servers to deploy applications based on AI. During the said quarter, the company signed multiple multi-year, multi-billion-dollar contracts (largely under the cloud infrastructure vertical), taking the RPO (remaining performance obligations) figure to $455 billion, which is all the more the main reason for the rally. Readers can understand RPO as order backlog for now. This is a rise of 359 per cent year on year and 230 per cent quarter on quarter. RPO is further expected to reach $500 billion in the next few months. For context, Oracle’s FY25 revenue was $57.4 billion. Though the company is making the right moves to make the most of AI-led demand, there are a few factors that are noteworthy here. First, RPOs represent contracted revenue that is yet to be recognised. Revenue can be recognised only if Oracle could discharge its contractual obligations when the time comes. Thus the $455-billion RPO is not an absolute guarantee that it would translate to future revenue. Contract cancellations and unfavourable modifications to the contract terms could result in material write-down of RPOs. Second, Wall Street Journal reported that Oracle has struck a $300-billion deal with OpenAI, likely spanning over five years from 2027. Now, looking at this in tandem with the $455-billion RPO figure, it leads one to believe that much of the future revenue is tied to one single client – giving room for concentration risk. What is even more concerning is the fact that OpenAI is a cash-burning start-up, run on venture capital, with about $10 billion in annual recurring revenue, per media reports. Third, while the company appears to have a robust road-map for the cloud infrastructure business, there isn’t relatively as much clarity as to the future of the rest of the businesses. Currently, the cloud infrastructure business accounts for just 17 per cent of overall revenue based on FY25. In the last five quarters, this vertical has clocked year-on-year constant currency revenue growth of 51 per cent on average. This, while the rest of the verticals have grown at a mere 2.5 per cent. While such concerns linger, the market’s reaction appears premature and running ahead of fundamentals. Even in the last five years, the company’s execution record has not been strong relative to its stock price performance. On an absolute basis, while earnings have grown 23 per cent on an absolute basis over that of FY20, stock price during the same period has risen close to 400 per cent. Even before the 36 per cent jump last week, the stock was trading at a trailing PE of 54x, which is not inexpensive. As of September 19, it trades at a PE of 69x. All things considered, this very simply reflects investors’ euphoric bet on anything linked to AI. But is it turning into a bubble, one that is reminiscent of the dotcom bust? Before addressing the pertinent question, investors first need to understand the sheer size of economic interest involved in the ongoing AI race. Here’s some crazy statistic. Since January 2020, the market cap of the S&P 500 index has risen $31 trillion. On another hand, the top 10 AI stocks, that are part of the index, have added $18 trillion to their combined market cap. These include Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Tesla, Oracle, Broadcom and Palantir. This is saying, the worth of just 2 per cent of the index’s stocks have grown equivalent to 60 per cent of the index’s gains, while the rest 98 per cent got the short end of the stick (40 per cent). Also, currently, the market cap of these stocks put together is as large as 40 per cent of S&P 500’s market cap. Further, the current AI surge demands unprecedented capital expenditure, as companies compete to build the computational infrastructure. These include real estate for data centres, the cutting-edge GPUs and related cooling systems and network hardware. In the past few years, Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta and Oracle (in descending order of quantum of capex; referred to as Big 5 in this article) have been large spenders on capex. Together, the Big 5 have invested an aggregate of $586 billion over the last three fiscals. They are expected to incur about $860 billion in the next two years. This is almost as big as how much the US spends on defence every year. Historically, the Big 5 have been asset-light businesses. However, with capex picking up lately, their combined fixed assets turnover ratio (only tangible assets considered) has gradually declined year on year to almost half of what it was 10 years ago — from 4.6 times to 2.2 times now. To put it in perspective, if one were to assign the multiple of 4.6x to the capex expected to be incurred in 2025 – about $400 billion (see chart), the expectation is that there should be an incremental revenue of $1,850 billion. However, the combined revenue of the Big 5 in the recently-concluded fiscal was only about $1,500 billion and it has taken decades since these companies were incorporated to reach such a scale. Even at the lower end of the multiple – at 2.2 times, incremental revenue required out of the capex would work out to $880 billion by end of FY25. For context, the combined revenue of the cloud verticals of the Big 5 is just about $250 billion today. Even if one were to assume that incremental revenue will kick in with a lag, the argument does come across as a hard sell, especially with these figures. Another statistic that brings out how big the AI capex has become for the economy is the one from the US’ Bureau of Economic Analysis. It measures the contribution of segments of the economy to the overall GDP every quarter. For example, if the GDP growth (real) rate during the quarter is 3 per cent and the contribution of personal consumption expenditure (PCE) reads 1 per cent, then it means that PCE has contributed to a third of incremental GDP. Similarly, for the recently-concluded quarter (Q2 2025), GDP growth was 3.3 per cent, but contribution of gross private domestic investment came in at -2.7 per cent. However, contribution of investment in information processing equipment and software (tech capex), which form part of gross private domestic investment, stood at 0.8 per cent. This shows that despite a slowdown in the overall private capex in the economy, tech capex has stood resilient. For lack of further detailed classification, information processing equipment and software have been considered here, which can be safely assumed to be substantially driven by the ongoing AI, data centre capex. If one were to construct a two-quarter moving average line of this contribution to GDP measure, in the recent quarter, the contribution of tech capex to GDP (1.1 per cent) has, in fact, surpassed the contribution of PCE to GDP (0.7 per cent) for the first time, in the quarters analysed since 2022. This is big, especially when you consider the fact that PCE accounts for about 70 per cent of US’ GDP. Considering the above pointers, it is quite clear that the AI mania is now just too big to fail. Whether it is the wealth effect and its consequent positive impact on economic growth or their hard capex driving a good chunk of the economy or the investor sentiment riding upon these companies, it is in the best interest of all stakeholders that expected revenues start flowing in. Looking ahead, AI is still an evolving technology and so, the picture looks murky today. One, there isn’t yet concrete evidence proving efficiency gains from use of AI would be attractive and cost effective enough to drive healthy adoption in enterprises. Two, while LLMs are being trained by spending on bleeding edge GPUs, there are noticeable positive developments with smaller models that wouldn’t require as much compute as LLMs, sometimes possible even without GPUs – raising the question as to what is the right level of capex. Three, today broadly AI is being used in applications such as summarisation, generative media, transcription and others – where the AI models do not appear to stand differentiated from one another. Sure, AI has found use-cases such as support services, pharmaceutical research and so on. However, the single most important application for AI in the next decade – which could be robotics or autonomous driving, for example, are not yet on the horizon when it comes to mass deployment. On considering the above, the valuations of top AI stocks today are not cheap, with all except Nvidia and Amazon trading at PE ratios above five-year averages. Palantir’s market cap is $433 billion, while its revenue is just $2.9 billion. Outside the top 10, stocks like AMD, ARM Holdings trade at PE ratios of 86x and 172x respectively. CoreWeave, a recently-listed cloud services company, is yet to turn profitable but is a $61-billion unit, with revenue and net loss of $1.9 billion and $863 million (FY24). In the unlisted space, AI start-ups are raking in capital from VC/PE funds at lofty valuations. Entities from within the AI value chain have become backers in some cases. Case in point, Microsoft’s, Amazon’s and ASML’s investment in OpenAI, Anthropic and Mistral respectively. All three are cash-burning start-ups valued at about $300 billion, $180 billion and $14 billion respectively (per known latest funding rounds). This exuberance does make one reminiscent of the infamous dotcom bubble of 2000 – when anything that had ‘Internet’ stamped on it was selling like hot cakes, even at unreasonable valuations. Right before the bubble burst in March 2000, the S&P 500 reached a PE ratio of 29.5x – never to see a rerating to such levels until April 2021, which too lasted only briefly. Today, its PE is reasonably close to such levels at 26x. However, the current market cap (of S&P 500) to GDP ratio stands at 2x, much worse than about 1.3x in March 2000. Even on a forward earnings basis, the index and almost all top AI stocks trade at PEG (price to earnings growth) ratios of over 2x, which appear unsustainable, all things considered. Though AI presents a structural opportunity to bet on, investors need to be extremely watchful of valuations as they can make all the difference. Investors will be better served waiting for now, in search of better entry points with higher margin of safety. As the AI craze continues to heat up, it is worth pondering on this quote from John Hussman, a fund manager who was prescient in his prediction of the dot com crash: Valuations often matter suddenly, and with a vengeance. This is a lesson best learnt before a crash rather than after one. In the interest of how much depends on AI investment and wealth effect, one will have to hope this time is truly different!

The advice doing the rounds that Indian investors ought to go big on US stocks to avoid ‘losing money’ from rupee depreciation, is the latest example. Their arguments are on the following lines. # If you’ve earned an 18 per cent CAGR (compound annual growth rate) from your domestic equity funds in the last five years, don’t be too happy. After adjusting for rupee depreciation, your returns are just 13 per cent. The rupee has been losing 3-4 per cent against the US dollar for the last many decades. The only way to shield your portfolio from this is to invest in US markets. # The AI revolution is sweeping the world. As AI replaces humans across industries, many Indian industries will be disrupted. Stay safe by investing in US Magnificent 7 companies. There’s a grain of truth in each of these statements; but it’s no more than a grain. If you’re thinking of making a wholesale switch from Indian stocks to the US ones, look before you leap. Investing a small portion of your portfolio in dollar-denominated assets to fund your overseas expenditure is a good idea. But this is a particularly bad time to replace your Indian equity allocations with US equities, hoping to earn a higher return or gain from dollar appreciation. Let’s first look at why Indian investors need to stick with rupee assets. Buy what you know: Globally, even professional and institutional investors have a home-country bias. That is, they invest the bulk of their portfolio in assets denominated in the currency of their home country. US investors stick by dollar assets and Chinese investors prefer yuan-denominated assets. This is quite simply because you get the best results from investing in what you understand. An Indian investor has a greater shot at understanding and tracking the Indian economy, consumers, companies and government policy, than the US economy, its consumers or government policy. When professional investors or institutions invest outside their home country, they think of this as a risk and hedge against it. USD weakening: It is also dangerous to expect the dollar to deliver 3-4 per cent gains against the rupee like clockwork. Yes, over the last three decades, the rupee has lost ground against the dollar at a 3-4 per cent annualised rate. This is because India has consistently run a current account deficit and needed foreign capital inflows to fund it. But there’s no guarantee that rupee depreciation will continue at this rate to perpetuity. If a shrinking current account deficit, a healthy economy, improving sovereign ratings or attractive stock valuations or bond yields woo back foreign investors to India, this can slow the pace of rupee depreciation. In fact, the dollar index is down 10 per cent since the beginning of 2025, on tariff turbulence and rate cut expectations. US policymakers are, today, keen to allow the dollar to weaken substantially, so that US exports can be made more competitive. Mirror your expenses: The basic purpose of financial planning is to fund your future expenses. If your future expenses such as buying a home or setting up a pension fund are going to be in rupees, your investments need to be rupee-denominated too. Yes, rupee depreciation can indirectly peg up your expenses if imported goods such as crude oil, gold, industrial metals or edible oils get costlier. But all this gets captured in domestic inflation numbers. As long as you plan your investments to beat inflation, the currency impact on your daily expenses is taken care of. You need dollar assets in your portfolio only to the extent of financial goals that will entail spending in dollars. If you plan to tour the US, enrol in a US master’s programme, pursue higher education for your child in American universities, that portion of your portfolio needs to be invested in dollar assets. Switching from Indian stocks to US stocks today, based on valuation concerns, is akin to jumping from the frying pan into the fire. Here’s why. * As the Indian market has enjoyed a breathless bull run since Covid, the US market has rallied right alongside it. In the five years to September 2025, while the Nifty50 has gained 120 per cent, Nasdaq100 Index is up 127 per cent and US S&P 500 112 per cent. Yes, Indian markets have turned expensive after this rally with the Nifty50 at a 22 PE and the Nifty500 at 25. But then so has the US market, which now appears over-valued by most metrics. The Buffett Indicator (market cap to GDP) for the US hovers at 217 per cent against the fair level of 100 per cent. S&P index’ trailing PE of 26 times is well above the long-term average of 18. The forward PE of 25 stacks up against the long-term average of 17. Therefore, if Indian stocks can get derated on earnings disappointments, so can US stocks. * After a post-Covid boom, the Indian economy has normalised to 6.5-7 per cent growth rate. The US economy is, however, on the verge of a sharp slowdown. Last week, US Fed members projected that GDP growth could slow down to 1.6 per cent in 2025 and 1.8 per cent in 2026 from 2.8 per cent in 2024. With government spending cuts, US jobs growth has fallen off a cliff in recent months with monthly non-farm payrolls averaging 29,000 in June-August 2025 against 82,000 same time last year. The impact of these job losses on consumer spending and the economy is yet to play out. It is hard to believe at this juncture that tariff flip-flops, job losses and the spending slowdown that follows will have no impact on US corporate earnings. Whether Fed rate cuts will make up for all this remains to be seen. * Unlike the Indian government, which has been cutting back on borrowings post-Covid, the US has been binge-borrowing, with its debt at $37 trillion and debt-GDP ratio at over 120 per cent now. US bond market yields have been highly volatile in the last one year and are at present above the levels at which they were when the Federal Reserve started cutting rates in September 2024. Rising bond yields ratchet up the cost of borrowings for the US government and companies, and can spook capital flows. Global central banks have been diversifying away from the dollar into gold holdings in recent times. * A popular argument for investing in US equities is that no other market offers the opportunity to own a piece of global hyper-scalers such as Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, Nvidia and Amazon. This is true. The Magnificent Seven, thanks to their technological prowess and the global dominance of their platforms, have managed scorching growth rates in revenues, profits and cash flows over the past decade. In recent years, they have invested eye-watering sums in AI capex, building up hopes that rising AI adoption will drive the next leg of supernormal growth for these companies. It is thanks to these expectations that the market capitalisation of Magnificent 7 stocks has rocketed to $21 trillion, nearly five times India’s GDP. Just seven stocks now make up 34 per cent of US stock market capitalisation. Mag 7 stocks have belted out a 38 per cent CAGR in the last 10 years. But after a decade of scorching earnings growth and even more scorching stock price performance, some market veterans are beginning to question if the hyper-scaler story has been stretched too far. There are worries about whether AI monetisation will lag capex, and if Mag 7 companies will end up decimating both their cash flows and shareholder returns in their pursuit of GenAI. Comparisons are beginning to be made to the infamous 1999-2000 dotcom bubble (See Big Story). Therefore, Indian investors who need dollar exposures in their portfolio because of specific goals, should explore stocks outside the Mag 7 and gold at this juncture. Others should stick to Indian equities and bide their time on overseas diversification. Published on September 20, 2025 Copyright© 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Title: Stock Buybacks Have Slowed. Here's Why It Matters That They Could Bounce Back.

Full Content:
A slump in stock buybacks could be in the rearview mirror. What that means for stocks is more complicated. S&P 500 buybacks in the second quarter fell 20% from record highs in the first quarter, but they are expected tick up in the current one. With economic policy uncertainty starting to dissipate and interest rates headed lower, repurchase activity from companies in the broad market index is expected to return to record levels, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Wall Street analysts, however, say buybacks may not be as helpful to EPS growth as they once were. Headline buyback figures are big, but their growth has stalled lately even for the biggest companies in the index. Companies like Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), Alphabet (GOOGL) and Nvidia (NVDA), which usually account for about 30% of annual buyback spending, posted no meaningful year-over-year growth in the second quarter, according to a recent Goldman Sachs report. A lack of buyback activity has resulted in a lower buyback yield—which measures total buybacks over a given period divided by market cap at the start of that period—for the the S&P 500 over the past 12 months. The figure recently touched 2%, the lowest level in 20 years, excluding recessions. (That is, however, partly due to big spending on artificial intelligence that has contributed to a decline in share repurchases.) Share prices have risen faster than earnings have, and payout ratios have fallen, leading to higher price-to-earnings multiples and lower buyback yields. A falling buyback yield means less of a boost to earnings per share: Buybacks result in lower shares outstanding, and buybacks from 2005 to 2019 boosted EPS growth by a median of 1.2 percentage points annually, according to Goldman. That tailwind has fallen off lately. The decline in the S&P's buyback yield is expected to level off as share repurchasing activity returns, per Goldman. The firm estimates share repurchases to total $1 trillion this year, 5% higher than in 2024. But in the meantime, companies that have sustained buyback activity—so-called buyback aristocrats, or companies that consistently repurchase their shares—could benefit from a rising scarcity premium, Goldman analysts including Ben Snider wrote. The median buyback aristocrat tends to have larger market-caps, higher buyback yields, lower valuations relative to the broader index, and generated a higher year-to-date return. The list of aristocrats includes Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Applied Materials (AMAT), eBay (EBAY), Ross Stores (ROST) and TJX Cos. (TJX), according to Goldman.

Title: This Week in Games - Nintendo September Direct 2025
URL: https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/this-week-in-games/2025-09-19/nintendo-september-direct-2025/.228798

Full Content:
Welcome back, folks! I hope everyone enjoyed my cameo appearance in This Week in Anime yesterday. I'd have made a cute segue for it in last week's column, but things were arranged a bit too late for that. It's always nice to collaborate with Steve, Coop, and Chris, especially when I can chat about topics I'm familiar with. I got to meet Chris in person for the first time a few weeks back; he's just as charming as his writing. We were also able to meet up with fellow This Week in Anime alums Nicky. Good times were had by all! Today, though, we're covering a ton of news—so let's begin. People sure love tempting the Persona 5 curse. You'd think after Star Ocean: anamnesis, Dragalia Lost and the Fullmetal Alchemist gacha, folks would have a bit of trepidation about collaborating with Persona 5. Oh well! Here comes Overwatch 2. Overwatch 2 has had a lot of collaborations with Japanese media lately, and they've been hit-or-miss. The One-Punch Man outfits didn't look great, and the Cowboy Bebop collab was all right (given some weird faces). This time, the suits look pretty good. Mercy as Panther/Ana actually looks pretty great, and I can't fault any of the other choices (D.Va as Queen/Makoto, Genji as Skull/Ryuji, Wuyang as Joker/Akira, and Lifeweaver as Fox/Yusuke). They've even got art from Shigenori Soejima; that's at least as much effort Fortnite would put into one of these. The collab started on September 16; at the time of writing, further details haven't been released. I snark, but the skins look legitimately cool. I might be a bit burnt out at the sight of Persona 5, and Overwatch has never really done anything for me. But kudos to Blizzard for finally getting one of these right. A major surprise dropped into our laps earlier this week with the reveal of two new Game Boy Advance titles added to Nintendo's NSO+ service—and both of them are third-party titles from Bandai Namco! While they were exclusives to Nintendo's old handheld, this opens a lot of fun doors for the NSO+ library. Provided, we might want to keep those reins in check: these likely came about because Nintendo and Bandai Namco have some very close business relations. Those old side-scrollers starring Nickelodeon characters might still be a bridge too far, more's the pity. First up is Mr. Driller, Bandai Namco's long-running puzzle series starring the eponymous miner. The Mr. Driller games are fun, hectic puzzlers: using your drill, you tunnel your way through variously-colored minerals, with entire blocks of like-colored minerals vanishing at once. But as you drill your way through, blocks that aren't affixed to larger blocks will fall behind you, forcing you to keep on digging to keep from getting caught in the cave-in. Complicating things is your oxygen meter: you lose air as you drill, and harder minerals require more effort (and thus more air), forcing you to be careful in choosing your path as you tunnel. It can be a long way between spare air tanks... Mr. Driller has never been a massive hit for Bandai Namco, but the games are fun—especially if you can take them on the go. Also fun is the lore behind the title: canonically, the titular Mr. Driller, Susumu Hori, is the son of Dig-Dug's hero, Taizo Hori. Taizo has even made cameo appearances in other Mr. Driller games! (The mom is Toby Masuyo, protagonist of Baraduke/Alien Sector. According to Namco x Capcom, Toby and Taizo had an acrimonious divorce.) The other game is another attention-nabber: Bandai Namco's beloved Klonoa: Empire of Dreams! I have a soft spot for the Klonoa titles: deceptively deep platformers with stunning presentation and music, and stories that rip your heart out. Empire of Dreams sees the Dream Traveler Klonoa having to clear his name of the crime of "dreaming of adventure." Of course, there's a reason why dreams have been outlawed, and Klonoa is likely to make us shed a few tears as he finds out the truth... Empire of Dreams continues the series' traditional mechanics: Klonoa can jump and flutter around a bit by flapping his cute, floppy ears. Klonoa also has his Wind Ring, which lets him inflate enemies. From there, Klonoa can carry them around, throw them at other enemies, or throw them after jumping to extend his jump. It's basic stuff on paper, but eventually expanded into surprisingly complicated platforming sections. The Klonoa titles might be cute, but 100% completion is a true challenge in those titles. My heart always weeps for Klonoa. We were fortunate enough a few years ago to get the Phantasy Reverie Series back in 2022, and I was luckier still to get to review it. Bandai Namco even teased a possible Klonoa 3 if the collection sold well enough... but it's been three years. At the very least, the Phantasy Reverie Series regularly goes on sale for very cheap; at around $10, these are some of the best platformers you can get your hands on. I'd at least like to hope that Empire of Dreams coming to NSO+ means that the other GBA Klonoa titles are on the table. Dream Champ Tournament is also cute, but Legendary Star Medal never came to the United States. We can only hope for more chances to hear Klonoa's adorable "WA-HOO!" Both of these titles go live on NSO+ this September 25. Last week, I mentioned how Nintendo and Pokémon have become a serious "bitch eating crackers" for the gaming industry and for self-described "Gamers." For folks unfamiliar with the phrase, a "bitch eating crackers" is when you have such dislike for someone that something as innocuous as them eating crackers at the other side of the room ticks you off. I maintain that. Mind you: More than a few decisions in the following Direct did turn me off... but also, I wasn't catastrophizing about this being the worst display of arrogance from a company that "needs to be humbled." Because there wasn't any need to. I worry if I'm the crazy one, but then I read past the headline of an article... With 2025 being the 40th anniversary of the Mario Brothers, Nintendo has arranged for several fun goodies: special art and light displays at the Nintendo Museum in Kyoto, sponsoring the annual Kyoto Marathon... fun stuff. There was also the news that the Mario Bros. sequel is being developed, and it's going with Super Mario Galaxy. (A lot of folks have pointed out that Old Spice jumped the gun a little and spoiled the reveal with some of their promotional stock that is in stores now. Whoops.) Weird that the movie is going with Galaxy, but considering that none of the other Mario games escalate on the level Galaxy does, I see where they're coming from. Doki Doki Panic has been buried; Super Mario Bros. 3 and Super Mario World only really introduce the Koopalings, which aren't enough of a draw; Super Mario 64 and Super Mario Sunshine don't really shake up the formula enough, and Illumination still thinks Chris Pratt is more charming than Charlie Day, so that's a no-go on Luigi's Mansion. No word yet on who's playing Princess Rosalina, but Rosalina's storybook (as in, an actual physical representation of it) is for sale on Nintendo's website and set to release this November 25. The real disappointment was the news that Super Mario Galaxy and its sequel are getting a remastered physical release—at full price, US$70. This is following the Super Mario Bros 3D All-Stars, which already included the first Super Mario Galaxy. Let me be clear, I think people have lost their damn minds when it comes to game price discourse. I saw someone comment that Digimon Story: Time Stranger "doesn't look AAA, so it shouldn't be priced like a AAA game," which is a great way of completely disregarding the amount of effort that went into actually producing the game. It is my genuine belief that Steam's firehouse sales have destroyed any semblance of value when it comes to a game; why buy a game at full price when you can get it for 20% off at the Summer Sale? And why pay that when you can get it for 30% off at the Winter Sale? And why pay that when you can get it for $5 at the next Spring Sale? I feel like the effort put into remaking a game top-to-bottom isn't invalidated just because the game was originally released on Game Boy or because you can't see the individual scales on Gomamon's Marching Fishes. That said, US$70 for both Super Mario Galaxy games is where I draw the line. Both of those titles were US$20 on the Wii U! We already had Super Mario Galaxy in the first 3D collection! This is what a piss-take looks like, if you ask me. But this got weirdly ignored following the further news. At any rate, it releases on October 2, with promotional Amiibo (Mario with a Luma, and Rosalina reading a book to several Luma) releasing on April 2. I rather like the Rosalina Luma a lot. I'd rather buy that than the US$70 two-pack. I regret to inform you all that the following news involves tennis. (Cue the clip of Rex Mohs screaming his soul out in disgust.) We're getting a new Mario Tennis game, titled Mario Tennis Fever. The titular gimmick is the fever rackets: tennis rackets that can build up energy over the course of a rally to activate special effects. There are over 30 Fever Rackets, with all sorts of effects like freezing the opponent's side of the court or summoning Mini Mushrooms. There is also a record-breaking amount of characters in Mario Tennis, over 30. There are also a variety of modes, like the standard Tournament mode and online Ranked modes, along with a mode for motion controls or randomized effects on the court ("Mix-It-Up" mode). The Adventure Mode is most intriguing. It's a story mode where the Mario characters are turned into babies and have to relearn tennis skills as they travel through a world. It's a good way to mask a tutorial mode, especially for people who aren't great at tennis simulators. Mario Tennis Fever releases on February 12, 2026, but, y'know, it's tennis without Ultra-Smashes. Super Mario Wonder is also getting a dedicated port on Nintendo Switch 2—but it's not just a graphical update. New features and content were teased, but we won't hear about that until later. The main feature the Direct focused on was the Bellabel Park update, which adds a variety of multiplayer options. A lot of these are actually quite fun as party games. Also, like, if we're getting toys of Nintendo characters, can we get more Yoshi toys? There's so much money left on the table from Nintendo not making a full stable of Yoshi toys. Speaking of the T. Yoshisaur Munchakoopas: A thing I appreciate about the Yoshi games is their use of different aesthetics. The original Yoshi's Island was ostensibly a Super Mario World sequel—but it abandoned the look of the original game in favor of a crayonesque design, along with its own unique platforming mechanics (i.e., carrying Baby Mario around). Yoshi's Story wasn't great, but its pop-up book aesthetic still looks pretty good. And so on with other games like Yoshi's Woolly World. So Nintendo's going all-in with Yoshi and the Mysterious Book. With the help of the encyclopedia, Mister E (get it?), Yoshi and his friends must fill out the missing pages. The whole thing is done as a side-scrolling puzzle game, figuring out the various abilities of the creatures Yoshi encounters while using the world around him to move around. The trailer showcased a puzzle where Yoshi had to spread dandelion seeds to erode a boulder that was in his way; that's some good lateral thinking. They'll have a real winner on their hands if they can properly iterate on that kind of stage construction. Also, I like the in-universe aesthetic. It's a bit Super Mario Wonder in its approach, but with undercranked character animations to sell the "illustrated" aesthetic. See, this is the thing I like seeing from Nintendo; it's disappointing that this kind of attention to detail doesn't get its due appreciation. That's not Bill Trinen! Nintendo had a minor once-over for Tomodachi Life: Living The Dream, going over the basics of character creation and care. But there wasn't much else, outside of the confirmation of a Spring 2026 release. The burning question on everyone's mind is whether Living The Dream will actually incorporate gay/lesbian couples. There was a kerfuffle over the original Tomodachi Life on 3DS, since this was impossible then (outside of a glitch). Games have come a long way in the years since, and even other Nintendo games have allowed for more gender-affirming options, such as referring to body types as "styles." And that's before you consider other titles like the Story of Seasons games, allowing for non-gender-locked relationships. It'll be a significant disappointment if Nintendo doesn't follow along. Here's a funny one. Square Enix originally broke away from Nintendo during development of Final Fantasy VII because Nintendo decided upon a cartridge-based format for the Nintendo 64, and Square Enix (then Squaresoft) had bigger goals in mind for their upcoming title. This was a particularly strong bit for them, so much so that they referenced the matter in their magazine ads. We wouldn't see new Final Fantasy titles on Nintendo consoles for years after that. Anyway, Final Fantasy VII Remake Integrade is coming to the Nintendo Switch this January 22. The first part of Square's ambitious three-part remake of the original Final Fantasy VII, the "Integrade" update includes new story beats and stages that center around Yuffie, explaining what she was doing before Cloud and company find her in the forest. There might be some graphical compromises, but I feel like those are small potatoes compared to being able to play a game of Final Fantasy VII Remake Integrade's scope on the go. Speaking of Amiibo! Nintendo has decided to introduce a Smash Bros-style mechanic to Kirby Air Riders wherein you can train Amiibo Figure characters. These characters will learn racing techniques as they play against you, up to and including developing a "personality" based around their experiences racing. So far, we only have Kirby on the Warp Star and Bandana Dee (no need for a middle name here) on the Winged Star. But also: the figures are swappable! You can unplug the riders from their machines, which will come in handy with upcoming Riders and Machines that are being teased. You can expect Meta Knight, King Dedede, and Gooey to come along with certain machines. I lack the experience with Kirby Air Riders to make any educated guess on those. Also, because Sakurai's 40-minute Direct focused entirely on Kirby Air Riders wasn't enough, there's going to be a second one in the near future. More updates on Hyrule Warriors: War of Imprisonment! The gameplay stuff sounds fun, but the most important bit is that it's Gameshare compatible: players will be able to play co-op across two consoles with just one copy of the game, including the original Switch model. It's a great move. I honestly wish more games offered this as a feature by default. Anyway, War of Imprisonment adds some new wrinkles to the Hyrule Warriors formula in the form of Tears of the Kingdom's Zonai tech. Using these ancient artifacts, players can mess with enemy groups or alter the battlefield. I appreciate the puzzle-based addition to the battles. I'm still not crazy for the post-Breath of the Wild Hyrule Warriors games because of the original Hyrule Warriors offering so much, but I can't knock them for actually trying to expand the formula. Few things disappoint me than how the gaming community has left Dragon Quest in an ivory tower. If everyone who namedropped Dragon Quest Monsters during the Palworld/Pokémon discourse had actually bought a copy of Dragon Quest Monsters: The Black Prince, Square Enix might have brought over more Dragon Quest Monsters games. And hey, all those arguments about Expedition 33 and Square Enix's turn-based games are incomplete without recognizing all of the work Square Enix has put into titles like Dragon Quest XI (like how the Switch adds a sprite-based mode for playing the game, a la the 3DS remakes). Dragon Quest isn't the end-all, be-all of Japanese RPGs, and there were plenty of other games that were made leading up to their original title on Famicom... but getting anyone to recognize Dragon Quest in America is an uphill battle. At any rate: Dragon Quest VII is getting a remake. And while it's not an HD-2D remake along the lines of the Erdrick Trilogy, it's nevertheless a top-to-bottom remake of the whole game. Er—another one, since we also had a comprehensive 3D remake of Dragon Quest VII back on the 3DS. Dragon Quest VII is a weird entry for the series; while tremendously overshadowed in the United States due to releasing alongside the graphical powerhouse that was Final Fantasy X, DQ7 also had a very long intro; famously, the PS1 original front-ended the game with a lot of puzzles, so much so that it could take you as long as five hours to encounter your first Slime in battle. Of course, there's a story reason: the protagonist accidentally petrifies his village, and he has to recover several stone tablets to break the curse. This whole quest has a very tragic ending, as many vignettes in Dragon Quest do, but it leads to a game that can have triple-digit length. Dragon Quest VII's deal is its class system: much like Final Fantasy V, characters can be given specific jobs for battle, with each victory leading towards improving their proficiency in that class. There are a lot of classes, many of which are unlocked as combinations of other classes. And that's before we get to the Monster classes, earned by fighting monsters. Yes, there's a Metal Slime class, and yes, it's a pain to unlock and master. Look forward to this one on February 5. Here's one that gets me: Nintendo is adding the Virtual Boy's library to the Nintendo Switch Online repertoire, along with other consoles like the Super Nintendo and the Nintendo 64. People have had words about this. For starters, the Virtual Boy was a failure of a console: its early attempts at 3D (plus everything being in shades of red) caused headaches, and the console wasn't very comfortable. All told, only 22 games were made for the console—14 of them are available on the NSO+Expansion service. This includes several... well, I can't call them "classics," but they're still noteworthy. Wario Land was the first game in the series, and had its first entry made on the Virtual Boy, making this the first time it's been ported, ever. There's also Jack Bros., a Shin Megami Tensei spin-off starring Jack Frost, Pyro Jack, and Jack Ripper. The point of contention is that the Virtual Boy games aren't available to play in 2D—they're exclusively designed for 3D play. So to play the Virtual Boy games, you'll need an accessory that effectively re-creates the original console that you'll slot your Switch or Switch 2 into. The accessory costs $100 USD, which I agree, is a lot. I understand why Nintendo made it; it's to keep the games in context and because they likely don't have a way to allow these games to be played in 2D without extensively reworking them—a tall order for 30-year-old games from a failed console. Nobody's playing a Virtual Boy game to play it in 2D anyhow, the way I see it. The bit where I scrunch my nose up is people doomsaying about the $100 add-on... when there's a $25 alternative that's also for sale. If you don't want to spend $100, you don't have to. Heck, I even appreciate that Nintendo found a new use for the Nintendo Labo components. But the discussion begins and ends with the $100 doohickey. I've seen other peers point out how Nintendo also offers Switch-compatible variants of older controllers, from the NES and N64 controllers to even the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive controller for use with the NSO titles; a quick look at Nintendo's store reveals that those are all in the ballpark of $65. My dudes, the cardboard option is cheaper than a N64 controller. There's so much to complain about. I don't understand why this is the straw that breaks the camel's back, nor do I understand why people can't see the cheap option that's literally right there. Speaking of old stuff, Koei Tecmo is bringing back another Fatal Frame title with a remake of Crimson Butterfly. Originally released in 2003(!), Crimson Butterfly tells the story of a young woman named Mio searching for her twin sister, Mayu, in an abandoned town. Along the way, Mio investigates an old ritual that the village was undergoing. Jumpscares and creepy Japanese ghosts ensue. The series' traditional Camera Obscura is still the central mechanic, a camera that can banish ghosts. This one's another comprehensive top-to-bottom remake; if it's half as good as the Mask of the Lunar Eclipse remake from 2023 (which I reviewed), it'll be a treat! Others and I would definitely prefer a new Fatal Frame proper, but this is a good-enough stopgap. Look forward to it in early 2026. I am disappointed that nobody is talking about the new Suika Game. Suika Game was a huge hit among streamers and players alike, and countless Suika Game clones have emerged in its wake, like IntiCreates' PuzzMix. Just this past summer, Shift-Up even had a Suika Game-esque mini-game for their Boom The Ghost event in Goddess of Victory: NIKKE! In upping the ante, Aladdin X has taken the game to the only place left to go: space. Suika Game Planet has you dropping fruit into an orb at the center of the screen. You can arrange the fruit all around the planet, but they can't break its surface (it's more of a bubble, so the edges have some give). Another twist is in the form of Super Evolution, which grants you bonuses depending on how many fruits of which type you've combined in a row. It's even compatible with Game Share on the Switch 2! I don't expect Suika Game to register on most people's radar, but it'll definitely be a fun hit once it lands this Winter. A major twist was delivered regarding Metroid Prime 4: Samus has a sick sci-fi bike! The reveal comes along with the twist that Metroid Prime 4 is now seemingly an open-world game, with Samus riding her new bike across massive vistas in search of new locales to explore. There's some consternation over this, given that Metroid has been at its best when it's nurturing a claustrophobic vibe. I'm with them. The trailer shows a sequence of Samus facing off against a pack of wolf-like creatures during a blizzard; it seems so pedestrian for Samus to be fighting space-wolves, given all of the other bizarre alien life-forms she's encountered. Regardless: Metroid Prime 4 is slated for a December 4 release, with Amiibo and an art book set to release shortly beforehand. Donkey Kong Bananza has some DLC out now. Most of us expected DLC related to the twist reveal in Bananza, but the DLC is only tangentially related: you actually get to explore D.K. Island! It even plays the song from Donkey Kong 64! There's also the new Emerald Rush mode, a rogue-lite mode where Donkey Kong has to smash enough emerald ore within a time frame. You'll find fossils and stuff that can unlock perks as you run around smashing things, and better performance unlocks new stages in lower layers. A unique twist is that the locations for all of the ores and fossils are a constant, so you'll be able to strategize and plan out your route. The news of Pokémon: Pokopia has some people unsettled, if only because your player character is a Ditto who has shapeshifted (badly) into a human. This has deep ramifications for the world of Pokémon that nobody wants to contend with. The idea itself is fun; however, Ditto will meet other Pokémon and learn moves from them that allow it to modify the environment. As the environment is made more comfortable, more Pokémon arrive, teaching Ditto more moves that allow it to create a whole village for the Pokémon to live in. The idea has been likened to Dragon Quest Builders, which I feel is apt (provided I haven't played Dragon Quest Builders yet). It's a cute idea, and I can see it leading into explaining how Pokémon in the Pokémon Mystery Dungeon games have places to live. Let's go into a lightning round for some other titles: Danganronpa 2 is getting an expanded port with Danganronpa 2x2, which not only includes the base Danganronpa 2 but also a new scenario with a new story. It'll be available next year, also on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Steam. Dynasty Warriors Origins lands on Switch 2 this January 22, with paid DLC announced. Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflections has a March 16 release date. Resident Evil 9 arrives for the Switch 2 on February 27, wildly enough, with Resident Evil VII and Resident Evil: Village in tow. A new Fire Emblem is coming! Fire Emblem: Fortune's Weave takes the series to a Greco-Roman setting, where some would-be heroes duke it out in front of their regent in the hopes of having a wish granted. Some fight for revenge, others fight for someone else. Sothis from Fire Emblem: Three Houses is back, so maybe this takes place in the same world? Who knows. I have an issue with Fortune's Weave, though. Several of the lead characters have darker skin; the protagonist we see is ostensibly a Black young man. His design is otherwise okay. I love his hair (he doesn't have the Killmonger haircut!). But a problem he and the other darker-skinned characters have is that they all have an ashy skin color. It does them a disservice. Mika Pikazo took a lot of heat for the toothpaste hair in Fire Emblem Engage, but she did right by the dark-skinned cast like Timerra by giving them beautiful skin tones. Even in Fire Emblem: Three Houses, Claude's olive skintone belied his Mediterranean-inspired origins. So it's a disappointment that the ball was dropped with Fortune's Weave. Still, the cast seems interesting, the designs are nice, and I especially like the hairstyles. So I'm hopeful. Here's where everyone lost their marbles. Paid DLC has been announced for Pokémon Legends: Z-A, which releases this October 16. Now, this DLC includes new story content, as well as two new Mega Evolutions for Raichu (Raichu X and Raichu Y). The announcement of paid DLC before the game has launched has people outraged... as though this is the first time any game has been announced with paid DLC at launch. The trailer also reveals new Mega Evolutions for the Kalosian starters, Delphox, Chesknight, and Greninja. Notably, these three Pokémon didn't have Mega Evolutions in their original game, which, in the eyes of many, was an oversight. Legends Z-A corrects this... but also, the Mega Stones for these Mega Evolutions are barred behind timed ranked play over the course of three in-game seasons. There has been a lot of discourse about this being beyond the pale and a sign of Nintendo's modern-day "greed." Let's break this down for a minute. First off: the DLC. Where have people been for the past decade? Super Smash Bros. Ultimate had announced paid DLC before it launched, too! And the only carrot on that stick was knowing that the first character in the DLC list was the Piranha Plant! Nintendo has done this with all three Xenoblade Chronicles games on the Switch, going back to Xenoblade 2! Getting the Season passes was how you unlocked a stash of items and the post-game stories (which are effectively games unto themselves). This isn't new! This hasn't been new for years! You can't even say it's exclusive to Nintendo—Sonic Racing Crossworlds also has been promoting paid DLC for the game, and that game hasn't launched either! There's a lot to argue over paid DLC as a means of bilking people out of their money, but that discussion has long since passed us by. One of the funniest clips from my favorite Vtuber is her going through almost a minute's worth of prompts from all the cosmetic DLC she bought before playing the game. For better or worse, paid DLC is just a standard factor in games these days. And you're telling me it's a problem now? In a Pokémon game? I've seen people claim that this artificially inflates the price of Pokémon Legends: Z-A--again, where have people been? Super Smash Bros. Ultimate costs $120 with both season passes—and you're going to want those, if you want to use Kazuya Mishima or Steve! It disturbs me how much people make this their hill to die on after actual years of literally every other publisher and developer going through with it. Especially since this is now such an entrenched belief with people. It's a truism that Nintendo is especially greedy, patent-starved and disrespectful to its fans and you're the crazy one if you bring up receipts proving otherwise. These are stances I can understand coming from rage-bait content creators online, who have the ears of the entire fandom. I am puzzled that people who should know better fall into these talking points. It's not even that paid DLC isn't a bad thing—it's sure as hell not, especially not since so many games had actual content cut from the main game just to be turned into DLC. That people decided Pokémon was where things were a bridge too far is what blows my mind. I half-expect that if Nintendo ever introduces a gacha system in a Pokémon game, it will finally prompt the rest of the industry to abandon the practice. There's also consternation about Pokémon imported from Pokémon Home getting stuck in Legends Z-A if and when they're imported. Again, not fun! I don't like this! But I understand why it's happening: Legends Z-A has a unique battle system and Pokémon data likely has to be reformatted to accommodate it, and it'll likely be too much of a pain to reformat Legends Z-A data back out of Legends Z-A. This means that the unique Mega Evolutions in Legends Z-A are landlocked into the game... for now. Seriously, there's no way Mega Victreebell or Mega Hawlucha aren't going to be made available some other way. Pokémon Champions is still releasing soon, after all. Again, this is disappointing... but people know that you can't import Pokémon from the first two Generations into Gen 3 onward, right? Even now, there's no legal alternative to get Pokémon from Pokémon Gold out of those games. Sure, there were digital alternatives on the 3DS—but if you wanted to rescue your old Lugia from your old cartridge, there's no official means. I'll go a step further, because as much as I dislike this, I still don't think it's the worst. Monster Rancher 4 had an exclusive in-game monster based on Kasumi from Dead or Alive. The only way to get her was by scanning a copy of Dead or Alive: Hardcore for the PlayStation 2. So you had to spend $100 to buy two games, to get a special-edition Monster. And that's just Kasumi—I'm not counting White Hound, a unique variant of the default Tiger monsters. You could only get White Hound in Monster Rancher 4 by scanning a DVD copy of Princess Mononoke (or Red Hot Chili Peppers' By The Way album). That's another, what? $30 USD? And I haven't even gotten to all of the other exclusive monsters. And then there's Yokai Watch 2's Local Yokai, which you could only get by playing participating Yokai Watch arcade games in certain regions of Japan. That's right: you had to physically travel across the country to get all the cards with the QR codes for these promotional monsters. Or buy the cards second-hand, which still takes money. It's bizarre how much anger gets levied towards Pokémon because I can point to so many similar issues from other monster-taming RPGs. And I think this really highlights the hollowness of much of the discourse surrounding the titles. It doesn't even invalidate the criticisms, but it definitely puts Pokémon into context. But that's the context that usually gets lost since most people don't look into the genre past Pokémon. That'll do it for this week. It's been a bit since I had a column this long... I stepped back and took a screenshot of the whole column when I had finished writing up the Nintendo Direct breakdown, and it was already long enough to be a column unto itself. That's what they pay me for, babes...! I might actually be glibbed out this time. Be good to each other. I'll see you in seven. This Week in Games homepage / archives
