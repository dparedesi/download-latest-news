[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, April 26, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against AppLovin Corporation (“AppLovin” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: APP) and reminds investors of the May 5, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inglate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025. Then, on March 26, 2025, Muddy Waters Research published a report (the “Muddy Waters Report”) concluding that AppLovin systematically used proprietary third-party data in ways that violated the terms of service of Facebook, Google, Snap, Reddit, as well as other platforms, potentially leading to backlash and service blocking and threatening the sustainability of AppLovin’s revenue growth. On this news, AppLovin’s stock price plummeted 20.1 percent, dropping from $327.62 to $261.70 per share on March 27, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding AppLovin’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others. To learn more about the AppLovin class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/APP or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).

Title: 9 Pieces of Advice for a Retired Doctor
URL: https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/retired-doctor-advice/
Time Published: 2025-04-26T06:30:56Z
Full Content:
We occasionally get requests for more posts about doctors who are on the cusp of retirement or already retired, so I thought I would highlight the situation of a doctor who posted on the Bogleheads Forum looking for advice. The relevant material in the post was as follows: “I am a 74-year-old retired, divorced physician with two sons and a partner who lives separately on a similar amount of assets. I currently have $2 million in investments with an advisor charging 0.7%, and I'm afraid to do this on my own. I have two homes, each worth about $1.8 million. The summer home has many expenses but no mortgage and is adored by my children. The winter house has a $360,000 mortgage at 3.1% and I want to keep both houses for now. I choose to give my kids big extras now, so they don't have to wait until I die. One son is in the arts, and I've said I would pay for childcare if he has children. My two sons are getting married, and I would like to give one $100,000 for a home purchase in the next 2-3 years. I had expected to follow the 4% rule but am finding I need 5.5% to cover my expenses. I was in 60% equities before COVID. I sold 90% of my equities in mid-2022 because I could not afford to hold and make it in retirement. Now I'm back in stocks with 20% of my portfolio (all big American companies including LLY, NVDA, Google, Meta, V, MSFt, Cost, ADBE, AMZN, AAPL) with the rest in bonds, including Treasuries, munis, and corporates. I am thinking about switching to Bogle Vanguard index funds—e.g. [a] three- or four-fund plan. But since I am actually retired, will this give me the 5.5% return? I know I will save some on management fees, but what would Bogleheads recommend as I find I need to go into my capital? Are there other recommendations for people actually in retirement, not just saving for retirement? I would need to get a Vanguard personal advisor, but will they send me cash each month? Are they reachable if I need to make a change? Sometimes I feel the Bogle plan is one-size-fits-all, and with this state of the world, I feel I need help financially adjusting to pandemics, wars, and now a good economy which could go bad depending on the state of the world! I don't want to run out of money!” I think there are nine things to learn from this example—some for this doctor and others for those who are not yet at this stage. It does not appear that this doctor is particularly knowledgeable about personal finance or investing, and it doesn't seem she's been doing a particularly good job managing her assets so far. Yet despite doing that AND probably cutting her assets in half in a divorce, this doc still has a net worth of about $5 million. Imagine how much more that could have been when combined with a dose of financial literacy administered early in her career. House poor is when you have a lot of wealth but it is all tied up in your house. In the case of this doctor, there is $3.6 million tied up in her two houses, but the remainder of the assets total up to just $1.64 million ($2 million in investments minus a $360,000 mortgage). Two million dollars is a big portfolio but not when it is being asked to support a lifestyle that includes twice that much in housing. Selling one of those two houses changes the assets-to-housing ratio from $1.64 million/$3.6 million to $3.4 million/$1.8 million. Dramatically different. Robert Kiyosaki might not have gotten everything right, but he sure was right about the house you live in being a consumption item, not an investment. More information here: How to Buy a House the Right Way This doc has lots of financial goals. She wants to pull 5.5% out of her portfolio. She wants to give her son $100,000 and cover childcare. She wants to maintain both houses. She doesn't want to marry her current partner and combine assets and housing. She wants someone else to manage her investments. She doesn't want to run out of money. She could do any one of those things. She could do most of them. But she probably can't quite do all of them. She's going to have to decide what her priorities are. Making mortgage payments in your 70s is a drag. It's a drag on your cash flow. I don't know what the monthly payment on that $360,000 mortgage at 3.1% is, but let's say it was originally a $700,000 30-year mortgage. The principal and interest payments on that would be $36,177 a year. While the return on paying off the mortgage would be 3.1% (or perhaps even less after tax), the cash flow that would be freed up would be more like 10% ($36,177/$360,000 = 10%). That beats the socks off of 5.5%, much less 4%. This “financial advisor” is charging $14,000 a year, and they allowed this investor to sell low and are now encouraging her to buy high. That's terrible stock market behavior. What's the point of an advisor who can't keep their client from doing that? And why hire an advisor at all if you're going to control the investments yourself? What's up with the individual stock picking and performance chasing, too? It's one thing to pay too much for good advice. It's entirely different to pay too much for bad advice—not that there is any price low enough for advice and service like this doc is getting. If this doc had been using index funds for the last 20 years and had, with the assistance of a good advisor, managed to curb bad investor behavior, her nest egg could easily be two or even three times as large. More information here: The Perfect Financial Advisor How Do You Know If You Are Getting Good Advice at a Fair Price? The 4% guideline basically says you can withdraw 4% of your portfolio a year, adjusted upward for inflation each year, and expect it to last at least 30 years with a high degree of confidence. How do you apply that in the life of a 93-year-old client? You don't. It doesn't apply. That 93-year-old is not going to live 30 more years. They probably won't live five more years. Let's go back to that Trinity Chart and see what it says about shorter time horizons. Note that the study didn't even bother looking at five- and 10-year periods. The shortest period on the chart is 15 years. There's nothing useful here for 93-year-olds. But I'm willing to go way out on a limb here and say a 10% withdrawal rate is completely reasonable for a 93-year-old. That's probably going to last 8-15 more years, and that's going to be plenty. What about a 74-year-old? What's the life expectancy of a 74-year-old female? It's 13 years. It's not bonkers to use the 15-year line in the Trinity study. You can be conservative and use the 20-year line or be ultra-conservative and use the 25-year line. If she has a 50/50 portfolio, she can withdraw 7% a year and expect it to last 15 years 84% of the time. Bump it down to 6%, and it's surely going to make it. So, 5.5% isn't going to be a problem. Even if she lives 25 years, 6% would work 70% of the time (and 5% would work 87% of the time), and it isn't like she can't adjust as she goes (i.e., sell one or even both of the houses). I'm not sure where the old maxim “Never spend your capital” came from, but I suspect it was from a bunch of immortal vampires or something. The rest of us are going to die at some point, and may we all be lucky enough to be heirs of someone who thought they weren't supposed to spend their capital. If you have a $2 million portfolio and never spend your capital, you're going to leave at least $2 million behind that you could have spent yourself or given away to charity with warm hands. Probably more like $4 million. Plan to spend some of your capital in a reasonable way during retirement. It's OK; you won't live forever. This investor feels like she needs an individualized portfolio—a portfolio that can be adjusted for pandemics and wars and good economies—and an advisor that can be reachable in the event she needs to make a change. None of that is likely true. The honest truth about asset management is that we could all probably be dumped into the Vanguard LifeStrategy Moderate Growth Fund (VSMGX) (or maybe the Conservative Growth Fund if we're 74) and be just fine. Seriously. Something reasonable, anything reasonable, is going to work when combined with adequate funding and a reasonable withdrawal rate. Thinking we need something special probably just costs us more in advisory fees and hassle. More information here: Retirement Spending Is Ridiculously Tax Advantaged A Framework for Thinking About Retirement Income A big fear for this doc is running out of money. She won't ever actually run out of money because of Social Security. But she doesn't have to set the floor on her spending that low. She can raise it with a Single Premium Immediate Annuity (SPIA). A SPIA purchased by a 74-year-old female pays 9.2%. Let's say she's getting $40,000 a year in Social Security. She can take $500,000 of that nest egg, buy a SPIA with it, and raise that floor from $40,000 to $86,000. No, that SPIA isn't adjusted for inflation like Social Security (that's why delaying Social Security to 70 is the best SPIA you can buy), but she's also 74. There aren't that many more years ahead of her for inflation to rear its ugly head. Using some of the nest egg to pay off the mortgage and some of the nest egg to buy a SPIA dramatically improves her cash flow, especially when she realizes she can easily take 6%-7% of the rest each year and spend it without much fear. The decumulation phase can certainly be more complicated than the accumulation phase, but this stuff isn't rocket science, much less nephrology. You can figure it out, and even if you need a little help, you can find someone who can provide that help at a fair price. What do you think? What takeaways do you have from this real-life example? What advice would you give this doc? This doc’s scenario is a textbook case for using a risk-based guardrails (RBG) withdrawal strategy. X% rules are ham-fisted at best – rough approximations of how much money one might need in the kitty to retire with, but terrible for using as a withdrawal strategy. And if she’s doing it that way, why in the heck is she paying an investment advisor 0.7%?? Any variable-percentage withdrawal (VPW) strategy would be better for her. An RBG strategy would be even better, providing her with a maximum spending level based on her current portfolio’s actual value coupled with an adjustment trigger – up or down – based on when her portfolio value hits an upper or lower guardrail. If she could find an advisor who uses that approach it might be worth paying for rather than a ‘roll your own’ BH simple portfolio approach. As for your other suggestions, I can’t add anything else. I especially love the “you can have anything you want; just not everything you want” observation. Yes, spend it down – portfolio and all. Yes, investigate a SPIA (maybe wait until 80, though?). Yes, get out of individual stocks and into index trackers (hopefully without taking too big of a LTCG tax hit). Until I was confident that my finances were secure, I wouldn’t 1) give $100K for a house down payment or 2) agree to pay for childcare. Also, I think she should consider selling one of the houses. I am only 62 and probably have as much with my spouse as she and her ex had before their divorce if it was in the past decade. I was unable to convince myself to give with warm hands until my mother-in-law died leaving money she should have spent on herself or given to her grandkids. Now I am willing and able to distribute to our kids good portions of what she left my husband and let him trade in his old boat for a new one so long as he names it after her. Likely we could have afforded to do it without the inheritance but since we had not counted on it I am pushing myself to technically remove it from our retirement plan. However I also find myself more willing to go out to eat or tip well now that our coffers are a little fatter. Interesting that “afraid to do this on my own” is coupled with several outsized wants. She appears to be alone notwithstanding an advisor whose services has produced this inquiry and should be fired on the spot. It isn’t clear whether the investments are in an IRA or similar retirement account or a regular taxable brokerage account. I suggest starting with some accounting help with budgeting to get on a sound financial footing with no debt and appropriate liquid cash equivalents. Also possibly counseling as I read this. The investment part will then take care of itself. Not sure if WCICON replays would help, the Bogleheads University videos might, and reading The White Coat Investor and The Little Book of Common Sense Investing are musts. Dr Dahle, I think you did a great job analyzing this Doctor’s question and situation, so I don’t have much to add. Regarding the advisor, if she overrode the Advisor’s advice and made the decisions to sell out of equities initially, then I would give a bit of a pass to the advisor. It’s not clear from her statements whether that is the case but I do recognize it as a possibility. My other thought is that maybe she should watch a bit less news and thereby not worry so much about economic calamity. Love your work. Thanks. It’s also interesting that this post was written long before the election, much less the market events of April 2025. I agree about the advisor. She really needs someone to guide her better. Or at least align her goals closer to reality. I would personally be uncomfortable with her overall plans. Regarding the houses, it is a pure luxury in this day and age to have a second house. Especially if unused half the year or more. I don’t know what a proper calculation would be, but I wouldn’t want a second home unless I were worth twice what she has. Maybe not even then. I would consider turning one into a rental and if the kids love it enough they can rent it a few weeks out of the year. Otherwise if it were me, I would sell it. If not, I would personally downgrade the other priorities. Childcare alone in the California Bay area can hit 30k a year. Per child. Red flags abound in this situation. Age 74 and $360,000 mortgage don’t belong in the same sentence. Unless you can enjoy this place for just a couple more years of snowbirding and then sell it for more than what you paid for it, it would be wise to consider selling it now. I think renting a winter place for 2 to 3 months out of the year would still save you a lot of money. And if you gift your son $100,000 to help pay for a home, remember that you will be withdrawing more than that because you will have to cover your taxes from that large withdrawal (unless it’s from a Roth). And taking out that much money at once will likely move you into a higher tax bracket. It’s noble of you to want to help your adult children but you may need to reevaluate the size of your gifts to ensure that you stay financially solvent. We always hear to pay yourself first when saving money while we are working. You need to pay yourself first when in retirement as well! Interesting read. Why is it that the withdrawal portfolios often are a mix of only stocks and bonds? Seems other assets mixed in there can give a higher withdrawal when back tested. I think you should get Frank Vasquez from risk parity radio on the show. The Trinity study only included two asset classes (stocks and bonds) likely for simplicity. The concept of the study is excellent that there are sequence of returns risk and therefore you can’t take out say 8% per year even if your overall average return is 8%. However the 4% number is conservative over a 30 year drawdown. Your email address will not be published.

Title: Economic Digest: Nepal’s Business News in a Snap

Time Published: 2025-04-26T02:15:42Z

26 April 2025 Time taken to read : 12 Minute KATHMANDU: Economic Digest offers a concise yet comprehensive overview of significant business happenings in Nepal, presented in easily digestible summaries. The compiled reports reflect a broad spectrum of Nepal’s economic and governance dynamics, highlighting issues of regulatory enforcement, infrastructure development, and investment patterns. While NEPSE saw a minor rebound after days of decline, gold prices fell by NPR 1,000 per tola, and consumers continue to bear inflated petroleum costs despite a global price slump—benefiting Nepal Oil Corporation’s profit margins. Regulatory tightening was evident with Nepal Rastra Bank penalizing financial institutions and the Insurance Authority revising foreign employment fund rules. Simultaneously, Facebook faces a registration ultimatum, while Durga Prasai’s multi-billion-rupee loan default case underscores growing scrutiny of corporate misconduct. On the legislative front, the government introduced a bill restricting Everest climbs without prior experience and restructured taxi service standards. Meanwhile, infrastructure remains a mixed picture—rapid bridge construction in Saptari contrasts with chronic delays in Achham and Bajura. In trade and investment, local goods from Humla found markets in China, and Koshi Province reached out to Indian investors. Similarly, the NRNA Australia pledged investment interest, pending a friendlier climate. Despite having sufficient domestic production, the government controversially approved areca nut imports, raising questions about policy priorities. Other highlights include Sun Nepal Life’s rights share issuance, a capped agriculture budget amid high provincial demands, and calls to upgrade critical road segments affecting tourism. Despite global political shifts, MCC aid to Nepal remains intact, reinforcing continued strategic ties with the U.S. Nepse sees minor uptick after consecutive losses The Nepal Stock Exchange (NEPSE) index recorded a slight rise of 2.08 points (0.07%) on the final trading day of the week, closing at 2,658.02. After four days of steady decline, Thursday saw a mild recovery driven by increased investor activity. Out of the traded companies, shares of 83 firms rose, 161 declined, and one remained unchanged. While most sector indices dropped, the trade index climbed by 17.72 points, hydropower rose by 7.73 points, and investment increased by 2.81 points. Gold prices dropped to NPR 189,600 per tola on Friday, down from NPR 190,600 the previous day, according to the Federation of Nepal Gold and Silver Dealers’ Association. Silver prices held steady at NPR 2,000 per tola. On the global market, gold was trading at approximately USD 3,325 per ounce. Despite a 23.53% decline in international crude oil prices since the start of this fiscal year, the Nepal Oil Corporation has passed on minimal price reductions to consumers while posting profits of NPR 9 billion. Petrol prices have dropped by only 6.43%, while diesel, kerosene, and aviation fuel were reduced by 8.75%. The price of cooking gas has remained unchanged. MCC assistance to Nepal unaffected by U.S. political shifts Despite the re-election of Donald Trump and changes in U.S. foreign policy, the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) will continue its support to Nepal. According to Reuters, the Trump administration, under close ally Elon Musk, has ordered the suspension of MCC programs in most countries, except for Nepal and three others. Trump has questioned the effectiveness of such aid programs, arguing against the misuse of American taxpayer funds. Minister for Communication and Information Technology, Prithvi Subba Gurung, has issued a one-week ultimatum to Meta (Facebook’s parent company) to register in Nepal. Speaking at a program organized by the National Information Commission, he warned that failure to register would result in a ban. The minister emphasized that Meta earns substantial revenue from Nepal and must comply with tax and regulatory obligations, stating that no foreign corporation can be allowed to bypass national laws. Since the Mothihari-Amlekhganj petroleum pipeline came into operation six years ago, over 57 million kiloliters (5.71 billion liters) of diesel have been imported into Nepal. The Madhesh Regional Office of Nepal Oil Corporation reports that between 1,353 to 3,568 kiloliters are imported daily. In the first nine months of the current fiscal year alone, the import volume reached 851,338 kiloliters, with daily imports averaging 2,840 kiloliters in the last fiscal year. The Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) has taken disciplinary action against five financial institutions for breaching banking norms. These include three development banks—Mukti Nath, Narayani, and Salpa—and two finance companies—Janaki and Pokhara Finance. Among the violations, Mukti Nath’s chairman Bharat Raj Dhakal was found involved in unauthorized construction activities, leading NRB to issue an official warning. For the next fiscal year, the Ministry of Agriculture has capped the budget for new agricultural projects at NPR 1 billion across provincial and local levels. However, proposals from these governments have already exceeded NPR 30 billion. Minister Ramnath Adhikari stated that this ceiling includes funding for rural roads, markets, livestock programs, organic fertilizers, and crop improvement. The Non-Resident Nepali Association (NRNA) of Australia has expressed its intention to increase investments in Nepal. In a meeting with Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, NRNA Australia president Anil Pokhrel emphasized the desire of the Australian NRN community to invest more, provided Nepal ensures an investor-friendly environment. Discussions also included strengthening trade and economic ties, leveraging the investment framework, and enhancing bilateral cooperation between the two countries. The Nepal Insurance Authority has made a second amendment to the regulations governing the Foreign Employment Group Insurance Fund (PUL). Under the new rule, insurance companies must deposit premium records from the 1st to 15th of each month into the designated bank account by the 1st of the following month. Similar requirements apply to the second half of the month. Insurance companies must also submit details of claims and premium receipts to the fund manager, who must confirm the transactions. The Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport has introduced new national standards for taxi services under the “National Standards for Vehicles Used as Taxis 2081,” replacing those of 2076. The updated classification divides taxis into three categories—Ordinary, Deluxe, and Luxury—based on features like size, performance, and amenities. These rules apply to all taxis, including existing and newly registered ones. A proposed provision in the new Tourism Bill 2081 bars individuals from attempting Mount Everest unless they have previously summited a 7,000-meter Himalayan peak. The bill, registered in the National Assembly by the Ministry of Culture, Tourism, and Civil Aviation, also requires climbers to submit health certificates. Those deemed medically unfit will be barred from mountaineering or joining climbing teams. This bill will replace the Tourism Act of 2035 B.S. At the Nepal-India Partnership Summit held in Purnia, Bihar, the Koshi Province Committee of the Nepal-India Chamber of Commerce and Industry (NICCI) encouraged Indian investors to consider projects in the province. Committee president Mukesh Upadhyay highlighted investment potential in tourism, agriculture, and other sectors. The event was held in collaboration with organizations like the Sub-Himalayan Research Institute and the Nepal-India Centre. Sun Nepal Life Insurance Company is set to issue 27% rights shares, totaling 10,696,320 shares at NPR 100 per share. The total value of the issue is NPR 1.07 billion. Shareholders recorded by Baishakh 4 are eligible to apply during the open window from Baishakh 30 to Jestha 19. Nepal SBI Merchant Banking is managing the rights issuance. The Gandaki chapter of the Hotel Association Nepal (HAN) has urged the government to expedite improvements along the Narayanghat-Butwal section of the East-West Highway. Chairman Hariprasad Sharma Gaire stated that delays in upgrading the road have caused significant hardship for both tourists and locals, with ongoing dust and mud making travel unpleasant. The government has permitted the import of over 11,000 tons of areca nut for the next six months, even though local production—estimated at 14,500 tons annually—is sufficient. Critics argue that the Ministry of Industry, Commerce, and Supplies yielded to pressure from interest groups, especially after scrapping the import quota system last month. Six bridges have been completed in Saptari within the first nine months of the current fiscal year, and seven others are nearing completion, according to the Lahan Road Division Office. Chief Ashutosh Karna said that while load testing remains pending, these efforts aim to expand road infrastructure in the district. Notable projects include bridges on the Ghode Daha River and along the Rajbiraj-Chhinnamasta road. Despite allocating NPR 3.57 billion for 13 road projects in Achham and Bajura, delays persist across 14 out of 19 contracts awarded by the Infrastructure Development Office. Among these, two are designated as provincial pride projects. So far, NPR 1.89 billion has been spent, with NPR 573 million allocated for the current year. Deadline extensions have not resolved construction delays. Local producers in Humla have successfully exported traditional food products to Taklakot, China, under a cross-border trade agreement. Mukunda Rokaya, an entrepreneur from Simkot Municipality-6, reported that the initial shipment—featuring millet and buckwheat flour, walnut oil, and more—generated NPR 1.8 million in revenue. Controversial businessman and healthcare entrepreneur Durga Prasai is being investigated for loan defaults totaling over NPR 7 billion, related to three of his projects. Previously known for leading anti-loan repayment protests, Prasai now faces allegations of threatening bank officials, including a former NRB governor. He has been taken into police custody as investigations continue.

The SET index moved in a range of 1,127.46 and 1,161.03 points this week, before closing yesterday at 1,159.00, up 0.7% from the previous week, with daily turnover averaging 34.94 billion baht.

Title: APP DEADLINE ALERT: AppLovin (APP) Investors with Losses Encouraged to Contact Hagens Berman Before May 5th Deadline in Securities Class Action

April 25, 2025 13:50 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, April 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Just months after basking in the glow of a meteoric 700% stock surge, fueled by investor enthusiasm for its artificial intelligence technology and burgeoning ad business, AppLovin Corp. (NASDAQ: APP) is facing a shift in sentiment on Wall Street. Several prominent investment banks have significantly lowered their expectations for the stock following the release of multiple critical reports from short-selling firms about the mobile advertising technology firm. Adding to its woes, AppLovin is now facing a securities class action lawsuit. Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims and urges investors who purchased AppLovin shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. Class Period: May 10, 2023 – Feb. 25, 2025Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/app Contact the Firm Now: APP@hbsslaw.com 844-916-0895 Analysts Downgrade APP Shares The latest blow came on Friday, April 11, when The Goldman Sachs Group slashed its price target for AppLovin from a lofty $500.00 to a more sobering $335.00. This downgrade followed a similar move by UBS Group earlier in the week, when the firm reduced its price target on AppLovin from $630.00 to $450.00. Short Seller Onslaught: Allegations of Data Exploitation and Inflated Metrics These downward revisions follow a barrage of critical reports from short sellers. Most recently, on March 28, Muddy Waters Research alleged that AppLovin's ad technology "systematically" violates app store rules by "impermissibly extracting proprietary IDs" from major platforms to deliver targeted ads without user consent. The report also claimed a significant churn rate among e-commerce advertisers, contradicting company statements. Earlier, in February, Fuzzy Panda Research and Culper Research had also critiqued AppLovin's AXON software, with Fuzzy Panda later urging the S&P 500 committee to exclude the company due to alleged "data theft" and "revenue fraud." Securities Class Action Alleges Misleading Statements Adding to AppLovin's challenges, a securities class action lawsuit has been filed against the company. The lawsuit alleges that AppLovin misled investors about the capabilities of its enhanced AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and its "cutting-edge AI technologies." Specifically, the lawsuit claims that AppLovin created a false impression that its technology would efficiently match advertisements to mobile games and expand into web-based marketing and e-commerce. However, the suit alleges that AppLovin was instead exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms and using manipulative practices, including a "backdoor installation scheme," to force unwanted apps on customers. This allegedly inflated installation numbers and, consequently, the company's profit figures. The class action lawsuit further points to the short seller reports released on February 26, 2025, which detailed AppLovin's alleged reverse engineering and exploitation of advertising data from Meta Platforms. These reports also claimed that AppLovin utilized manipulative practices to artificially inflate ad click-through and app download rates, such as self-clicking ads and employing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads. Following the release of these reports, the price of AppLovin shares reportedly fell by more than 12%. Hagens Berman’s Investigation Prominent shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the claims. “The allegations detailed in the short reports and outlined in the recently filed class action complaint, detailing the purported exploitation of user data and manipulative installation schemes, raise serious questions about the integrity of AppLovin's reported growth and the accuracy of its disclosures to the investing public,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

Title: Google Parent Alphabet Leads Adtech Stocks Higher on Signs of AI Success

Shares of Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) climbed Friday, leading shares of several other adtech and AI stocks higher, after showing signs of success with AI features. Alphabet's Class A shares jumped over 4% to just above $166, before paring gains in recent trading. Shares of several other tech companies in digital advertising that use AI tools also gained, including Meta Platforms (META), Pinterest (PINS), Snap (SNAP), and AppLovin (APP). (Read Investopedia's live coverage of today's market action here.) The Google parent reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings Thursday, with CEO Sundar Pichai telling investors Google Search growth was driven by "engagement we're seeing with features like AI Overviews, which now has 1.5 billion users per month" in just under a year since its launch. Several analysts, including those at Citi and Wedbush, boosted their price targets for the stock in the wake of the results, pointing to its AI potential. Bank of America analysts, who also raised their price target, said they believe Wall Street "may be underappreciating" opportunities tied to search features like AI Overviews and AI-driven cloud demand. That trend could suggest more growth for other companies with cloud and digital ad businesses, with several set to report earnings in the coming weeks. Snap is scheduled to report next Tuesday, with Meta and cloud giant Microsoft set to follow Wednesday, and Amazon on Thursday. AppLovin is scheduled to release results the following Wednesday, May 7m with Pinterest's report due a day later.

This group brings together those who are interested in topics around oil and gas exploration, drilling, refining, and processing. Post Germán José Manuel Toro Ghio, son of Germán Alfonso and Jenny Isabel Cristina, became a citizen of planet Earth in the cold dawn of Sunday, May 11, 1958, in Santiago, capital of southern Chile.... All rights reserved by Germán & Co. Reproduction is strictly prohibited. By Germán & Co. Karlstad, Sweden | April 25, 2025 ________________________________________ The transformation of our relationship with news resembles the shift from voyaging on a sailing ship to piloting a supersonic jet. In the age of handwritten letters and horse-drawn mail coaches, news travelled like vessels charting ancient sea routes: steadily, predictably, with ample time for fact and rumour to be sifted before docking at the harbour of public consciousness. A letter from distant kin might take months to cross continents, and each word it bore was treasured with patience—information was scarce and therefore sacred. Today, we navigate a “digital Macondo hyperocean,” where, instead of one carefully composed missive, we are submerged in an unending torrent of fragments clamouring for our attention. News no longer passes through traditional verification customs; anyone may cast a message, like a piece of paper, into a bottle—into the cyber sea of Macondo—and millions may retrieve its contents simultaneously. Rather than a single official bulletin, the modern “port authorities”—governments and institutions—issue manifold and often contradictory communiqués. We inhabit a dishonest realm where every statement drifts under suspicion of falsehood. ________________________________________ In those forgotten years when the postal carriers—uniforms as strict as their expressions—imposed order upon the wilderness of streets with their mystic system of numbers, the world possessed a rigidity that made it legible. Even digits divided the righteous from the sinners: evens to the right, odds to the left. Colonel Aureliano Buendía had yet to witness the seventeen artificial roses that would blossom from his blood in the plaza, and the gypsy Melquíades had not yet returned with his parchments of miracles. Now we wander like blind men through a labyrinth of our design, our fingertips raw from brushing against walls that shift by the hour. We yearn for the certainty that once guided letters from lover to beloved across impossible distances, yet the compass needle spins madly, mocking our desperation. The boundary between right and left has dissolved like sugar in the bitter coffee of existence—a minor tragedy beside the greater dissolution that follows. In this perpetual twilight, white no longer stands apart from black, nor light from shadow. The grey mist that descended upon Macondo during those five years of unrelenting rain has settled permanently in our souls. We peer at moral questions through their haze, unable to discern their accurate outline, while ancestral ghosts whisper counsel that fades before we can grasp it. And here lies the most terrible revelation—an heirloom of despair passed down through generations: we have forfeited even the sacred right to choose. Our freedom languishes in the same distant chamber where undeliverable letters are heaped, forgotten in dusty corners where lamps never glimmer. The illusion of choice gleams before us like the golden fish Úrsula once dreamed of, always visible yet forever beyond reach, condemned to circle in waters too deep for our understanding. If we remember when we complained about the postal service, we did so because we did not know what the future would bring; it was impossible to imagine that ZIP codes would impose order on chaos and that envelopes—sealed with a quick lick and a spark of hope—would carry our faith across continents. The postal network, conceived by visionary officials and traced daily by letter carriers who mapped the world with every route, served as an invisible compass: a shared spell through which nations unable to understand one another knew precisely how to be found. Indeed, in every odd-numbered address lay a promise, in every even number, a certainty. ________________________________________ But now, adrift in a present that reeks of stale hand sanitiser and cables severed by tariff wars, we grope blindly through shattered coordinates. Postal routes, once sacred, have been replaced by supply chains that snap like threads of spittle in a dying man’s mouth. The Universal Postal Union, which in glorious times stitched together continents like the points of a single love letter, lies in tatters, replaced by a masquerade in which trade powers recite lies in diplomatic accents. In this deracinated age—a world without fixed coordinates, where addresses dissolve like salt in rain—there are no saviours in postal uniforms, no envelopes bearing redemption. The mailman’s whistle has gone silent, replaced by the hollow reverberation of footsteps that never arrive, never depart. They linger as spectres in the dust, those echoes: false promises of connection, of permanence. Empires crumble on schedule. Tyrants rot. Rebels in overalls, clutching Orwell’s tattered manifesto, rise from furrows only to inherit the same rot they sought to burn. History is not a straight road but a ouroboros, its jaws clamped tight on its tail, spinning the earth into a dizzying gyre of repetition. We exist in the parenthesis between ruin and renaissance, scribbling our names on air, sending letters to a future that rewrites itself endlessly. There is no fixed point, no destination—only the ceaseless orbit, the Sisyphean march, the myth of progress unravelling like a frayed postal route into the void. ________________________________________ Late last week, the Financial Times reported that President Vladimir Putin had “generously” offered to freeze Russia’s invasion of Ukraine at whatever line most suited Moscow. The pitch was whispered to Steve Witkoff—Donald Trump’s self‑styled envoy—during a meet‑and‑greet in St Petersburg. Never mind the optics: who better than a property developer to broker peace between armies? Washington, meanwhile, floated the notion of gifting Crimea to Russia and turning a polite blind eye while four more regions stayed under occupation. Voilà—peace! The proposal was trumpeted as the Kremlin’s first “formal” softening in three years, and some Western headlines applauded Putin’s "restraint" as though brutality measured in half‑steps were magnanimity. Less enchanted, European diplomats warned that the offer was likely bait: a showy concession designed to tether Trump to deeper Russian demands. Still, the story rolled on—amplified by Bloomberg, cross‑stitched by Swedish reporting, and wallpapered across the 24‑hour news feeds. Back home, President Trump’s standing was buckling. A Supreme Court setback and the worst poll numbers of his career formed the backdrop to the St Petersburg overture. Into that vacuum stepped The Mirror, gleefully quoting Trump, labelling Volodymyr Zelensky a "dictator" during a sour White House clash—footage Russian broadcasters replayed for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. ________________________________________ In a tableau torn from Dostoyevsky’s Crime and Punishment, a handful of nimble traders—moral compasses rattling like Raskolnikov’s heartbeat—scooped up billions on a toy‑company stock that whiplashed with every tariff tweet—sí, te quiero, poquito, nada: tariff on at noon, tariff off by dusk—while the broader energy sector bled nearly $150 billion in market value over the same 48‑hour whiplash—Brent futures slid 7 percent, the XLE energy ETF sank 6.2 percent, ExxonMobil alone vaporised roughly $22 billion in market cap, Chevron $18 billion, and the European duo of BP and Shell a further $25 billion. Clean‑energy names fared no better—ICLN (the global clean‑energy ETF) sank 8 per cent, First Solar erased $4 billion, Enphase another $3 billion, while Vestas and Ørsted together shed roughly €6 billion—altogether about $35 billion in green‑power market cap evaporated. Nor did Big Tech escape the downdraft: the so‑called Magnificent Seven—Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, and Tesla—collectively shed roughly $350 billion in market value during the same two‑day window (Apple − $80 billion, Microsoft − $70 billion, Nvidia − $60 billion, Amazon − $45 billion, Alphabet − $40 billion, Meta − $30 billion, Tesla − $25 billion). In the market’s brutal zero‑sum arithmetic, one player’s windfall is another’s ruin. This time, the crater opened beneath ordinary pension funds—state teachers’ and firefighters’ plans with heavy XLE exposure surrendered an estimated $9 billion in paper value. When you roll in police, municipal‑worker, and federal Thrift Savings allocations, public‑sector pension systems saw roughly $27 billion vanish inside two trading sessions. ________________________________________ Enter, stage left, the indispensable Mr. Dmitry Peskov—because what self‑respecting Kremlin melodrama would dare proceed without its dapper master of ceremonies? A career diplomat‑turned‑spin‑doctor, he glides through marble corridors brandishing a résumé as glossy as a freshly lacquered nesting doll: fluent in English, Turkish, French, and Arabic (thank you, MGIMO—Russia’s Hogwarts for budding power‑brokers), a formative posting in Ankara, and a society‑page marriage to Olympic ice‑dance diva Tatiana Navka. The man even sports a clipped Oxford accent, as if the Queen herself had coached him between caviar courses. And of course, this week’s Absolutely‑Limited‑Time Offer™—pitched with the grin of a duty‑free perfume hawker and the menace of a Bond villain—features: 🌹 One (1) Romanov‑era Fabergé egg—nothing whispers “trust me” like jewel‑encrusted poultry. 🌹 Lifetime first‑dibs on rare‑earth contracts—corner the battery market while saving the planet (fine print rendered in invisible ink). 🌹 Billions in natural‑gas sweetheart deals—blue flame, red tape, green cash. 🌹 And—crash the cymbals—the shimmering hallucination of a TRUMP KREMLIN TOWER®, stabbing the Moscow skyline and powered exclusively by Gazprom gratitude. The Moscow Times calls this glittering hamper “bait” to reel in Donald Trump; Peskov, ever the courteous angler, insists they are merely “areas of mutual economic opportunity.” Happy birthday, democracy—your cake is Fabergé, the candles burn methane, and the guest of honour just sold the bakery. The pièce de résistance? A February 10 executive order pausing enforcement of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act for 180 days “in the interests of national security.” Just in time to clear the path for all those mutual opportunities. ________________________________________ In memory of Pope Francis—the man of humility, inclusion, and the migrant—hailed, astonishingly, by both Vladimir Putin, the authoritarian leader of the Russian state, and Donald Trump, the former and current President of the United States, as though concord itself had sprouted wings. Their unlikely agreement in praising the pontiff bridged ideological chasms, creating a rare moment when these two powerful heads of state found common ground in their admiration for a man who consistently advocated for the vulnerable and marginalized.

Reproduction is strictly prohibited. The controversy surrounding the Trump administration's halt of Equinor's Empire Wind 1 project has intensified this week. New York Attorney General Letitia James filed a lawsuit challenging the Interior Department's decision, arguing it violates federal administrative procedures and established permitting protocols. Meanwhile, a coalition of environmental groups and labour unions has announced plans for nationwide protests against what they describe as "politically motivated energy policy reversals." Secretary Burgum defended the administration's position in a press conference on Tuesday, stating that all offshore wind projects are under review to ensure "economic viability and energy security." Ørsted announced a strategic review of its U.S. operations in response to the current regulatory climate, potentially delaying additional offshore wind investments. Meanwhile, in Europe, Finland has joined Sweden and Italy in accelerating nuclear power development, announcing plans to extend the operating licenses of its existing reactors and streamline approvals for new small modular reactor technologies. This week, the International Energy Agency released a report indicating that global renewable energy installations continue to grow slower than projected in specific markets due to policy uncertainties, supply chain constraints, and inflationary pressures. Crude oil markets experienced significant volatility this week, with prices rebounding slightly following last week's sharp decline. Brent crude settled at $72.40 per barrel on Thursday, up 3.2% from last week's three-year low, as markets reassessed the impact of China's retaliatory tariffs. On Wednesday, OPEC+ ministers held an emergency virtual meeting to discuss market conditions but maintained their current production strategy. ExxonMobil announced a $12 billion investment in Gulf of Mexico oil and gas development, citing the administration's supportive stance toward domestic fossil fuel production. Similarly, Chevron has reactivated previously paused drilling projects in the Permian Basin. Several automakers are reconsidering their U.S. electric vehicle manufacturing investments following the administration's rollback of federal incentives. Ford announced it will delay the planned expansion of its Tennessee battery plant by at least 18 months. General Motors is reportedly reviewing the timeline for transitioning certain production lines to EVs at its Michigan facilities. BYD broke ground on its first European manufacturing facility in Hungary this week, accelerating its international expansion despite growing trade tensions. The facility will produce battery electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles primarily for European markets. Brazil's environmental protection agency, Ibama, reversed its technical staff and granted preliminary approval for Petrobras to drill near the Amazon River mouth, sparking protests in Brasília and criticism from environmental organisations. President Lula defended the decision as "necessary for Brazil's energy sovereignty" while promising additional ecological safeguards. India's Power Ministry announced new grid integration measures to accommodate both coal expansion and growing renewable capacity, acknowledging the country's dual strategy will continue through the decade. The announcement came as parts of northern India experienced rolling blackouts amid an early heat wave. Energy sector stocks have shown divergent performance this week, with fossil fuel companies generally gaining while clean energy shares declined. The S&P Global Clean Energy Index fell 3.2% over the week, while the S&P 500 Energy Sector index rose 2.1%. Analysts attribute this pattern to anticipated policy shifts favouring conventional energy sources. Natural gas prices in the U.S. rose to a six-month high following forecasts of warmer-than-average temperatures across much of the country, increasing cooling demand expectations. European gas prices remained stable as storage levels continue to exceed seasonal averages. The markets are closely watching next week's Federal Reserve meeting for signals about interest rate trajectories, which could significantly impact energy investment patterns through the remainder of 2025. 📌 U.S. Climate and Energy Policy Reuters – "NY files legal challenge against Trump administration's Empire Wind halt" (April 23, 2025) Bloomberg – "Burgum defends energy policy amid mounting offshore wind controversy" (April 22, 2025) Politico – "Environmental groups plan nationwide protests over wind project cancellations" (April 24, 2025) 📌 Renewable Energy and Nuclear Power Financial Times – "Ørsted announces strategic review of US operations amid policy uncertainty" (April 21, 2025) World Nuclear News – "Finland accelerates nuclear development plan to meet carbon goals" (April 22, 2025) IEA – "Renewable Energy Market Update – April 2025" (April 20, 2025) 📌 Fossil Fuel Markets and Investment S&P Global – "Oil prices rebound from three-year lows as market reassesses China tariff impact" (April 24, 2025) Reuters – "OPEC+ holds emergency meeting, maintains production strategy" (April 23, 2025) Wall Street Journal – "ExxonMobil announces $12B Gulf of Mexico investment push" (April 23, 2025) Energy Intelligence – "Chevron restarts paused Permian drilling projects" (April 24, 2025) 📌 Electric Vehicle Market Dynamics Automotive News – "Ford delays Tennessee battery plant expansion amid EV incentive uncertainty" (April 22, 2025) Reuters – "GM reviewing EV transition timeline for Michigan facilities" (April 23, 2025) Financial Times – "BYD begins construction on first European manufacturing plant" (April 21, 2025) 📌 Geopolitical Energy Developments Reuters – "Brazil's Ibama approves Amazon drilling despite staff recommendations" (April 22, 2025) Estado de São Paulo – "Environmental protesters gather in Brasília following Amazon drilling decision" (April 23, 2025) Economic Times – "India announces new grid integration measures amid northern blackouts" (April 24, 2025) 📌 Economic and Market Trends Bloomberg – "Clean energy stocks slide as fossil fuels rally on policy expectations" (April 24, 2025) CNBC – "Natural gas prices hit six-month high on warming forecasts" (April 24, 2025) Wall Street Journal – "Energy investors eye Fed meeting for interest rate signals" (April 25, 2025) No discussions yet.

Catch up on select AI news and developments from the past week or so (in no particular order): YouTube tests AI Overviews carousel in search results. YouTube is experimenting with an AI Overviews feature that surfaces short clips from videos deemed most relevant to a user's search query. Available only to a small number of US-based YouTube Premium users, the AI-generated highlights are presented in a carousel format within search results. The test applies only to select English-language queries related to product research or travel. This feature mirrors the controversial AI Overviews in Google Search, which have been linked to declining site traffic. Importance for marketers: If widely deployed, AI Overviews could reduce visibility and video views, affecting branded content discoverability on YouTube. Trump signs executive order launching AI education initiative. President Trump has issued an executive order establishing a national AI education initiative and a new White House Task Force on AI Education. The order directs resources toward AI training in schools, teacher development, and an AI-focused Presidential Challenge. Despite recent cuts to the Department of Education, the administration aims to prioritize AI in discretionary grants and research. The initiative's success will depend on cross-sector collaboration and effective coordination across government departments. Importance for marketers: Broader AI literacy and workforce readiness could accelerate AI adoption across industries, influencing future demand for AI-based marketing solutions and services. Google finds UK workers can save 122 hours a year using AI for admin tasks. Google's AI Works pilot program in the UK showed that workers—especially older women in lower-income roles—can save 122 hours annually using AI for administrative tasks. Simple interventions like training and "permission to prompt" doubled AI usage among participants. The study suggests AI adoption barriers include legitimacy concerns and lack of confidence. With minor training, weekly AI usage rose from 17% to 56%. Google estimates AI adoption could add £400 billion to the UK economy. Importance for marketers: Demonstrates measurable time savings and the importance of upskilling, with implications for marketing operations and productivity improvements. Baidu launches cheaper, upgraded AI models to stay competitive. Baidu introduced two improved versions of its Ernie chatbot—Ernie 4.5 Turbo and Ernie X1 Turbo—at significantly reduced cost. The Ernie 4.5 Turbo model is now 80% cheaper than its predecessor, while the reasoning-focused X1 Turbo is 50% less expensive. The move comes amid rising competition from Chinese firms like DeepSeek and Zhipu AI, as well as global leaders like OpenAI. Baidu's share price rose after the announcement.

Investor claims AI is already replacing workers—especially in law and HR. VC Victor Lazarte claims AI is "fully replacing people," particularly in legal and HR roles. Critics point to recent courtroom mishaps involving flawed AI-generated legal documents as evidence that the technology isn't ready. Meanwhile, biased hiring AI continues to disadvantage certain job seekers. Importance for marketers: The rhetoric around AI replacement may shape how companies evaluate automation tools. Marketers must balance AI use with brand reputation, ethics, and accuracy—especially in regulated or people-centric sectors. Meta expands AI assistant access on Ray-Ban smart glasses in Europe. Meta is rolling out its Meta AI assistant to Ray-Ban smart glasses users in seven European countries. The AI can respond to voice prompts, offer translations, and identify real-world objects. The expansion follows regulatory delays in the EU.

IMF: AI's economic gains will outweigh emissions costs. The IMF estimates AI could boost global GDP by 0.5% annually from 2025–2030, outweighing increased emissions from energy-hungry data centers. Still, the report warns that benefits won't be distributed equally, and urges more sustainable deployment. Importance for marketers: This reinforces the importance of aligning AI innovation with ESG goals. Marketers promoting AI solutions should address sustainability and societal impact to resonate with stakeholders and regulators. YouTube adds AI-generated background music tool for creators. YouTube's new "Music assistant" lets creators generate copyright-free instrumental tracks by entering text prompts. Available to some users of the Creator Music beta, it generates multiple options for download and editing. Importance for marketers: The tool enables fast, legal background music creation for video content, helping brands produce compliant multimedia assets without relying on stock libraries. Creators Guild of America launches legal CGA Rider to protect content creators. The CGA has released a binding "CGA Rider" document that creators can attach to contracts with brands or agencies. It covers content rights, payment terms, revision limits, and AI usage permissions. Several platforms have already adopted it. Importance for marketers: As AI use and content reuse increase, marketers must align with creator rights protections. Using CGA-backed standards helps foster trust and compliance in influencer partnerships. Italian newspaper Il Foglio finds success with AI-written sections. Il Foglio published a daily four-page AI-written section for a month and plans to continue weekly. Editor Claudio Cerasa says AI excels at irony and summarizing books, but lacks critical thinking.

Title: The Meta Trial Shows the Dangers of Selling Out

Time Published: 2025-04-25T14:00:00Z
Full Content:
Meta has a lot at stake in the current FTC lawsuit against it. In theory a negative verdict could result in a company breakup. But CEO Mark Zuckerberg once faced an even bigger existential threat. Back in 2006, his investors and even his employees were pressuring him to sell his two-year-old startup for a quick payoff. Facebook was still a college-based social network, and several companies were interested in buying it. The most serious offer came from Yahoo, which offered a stunning $1 billion. Zuckerberg, though, believed he could grow the company into something worth much more. The pressure was tremendous, and at one point he blinked, agreeing in principle to sell. But immediately after that, a dip in Yahoo stock led its leader at the time, Terry Semel, to ask for a price adjustment. Zuckerberg seized the opportunity to shut down negotiations; Facebook would remain in his hands. “That was by far the most stressful time in my life,” Zuckerberg told me years later. So it’s ironic to observe, through the testimony of this trial, how he treated two other sets of founders in very similar situations to him—but whom he successfully bought out. This is an essay from the latest edition of Steven Levy's Plaintext newsletter. SIGN UP for Plaintext to read the whole thing, and tap Steven's unique insights and unmatched contacts for the long view on tech. The nub of the current FTC trial seems to hinge on how US District Court judge James Boasberg will define Meta’s market—whether it’s limited to social media or, as Meta is arguing, the broader field of “entertainment.” But much of the early testimony exhumed the details of Zuckerberg’s successful pursuit of Instagram and WhatsApp—two companies that, according to the government, are now part of Meta’s illegal monopolistic grip on social media. (The trial also invoked the case of Snap, which resisted Zuckerberg’s $6 billion offer and had to deal with Facebook copying its products.) Legalities aside, the way these companies were upended by a Zuckerberg offer made the first few days of this case a dramatic and instructive study of acquisition dynamics between small and big business. Though almost all of these narratives have been covered at length over the years—I documented them pretty thoroughly in my own 2020 account Facebook: The Inside Story—it was striking to see the principals testifying under oath about what happened. Hey, my sources were pretty good, but I didn’t get to swear them in! In their testimony, star witnesses Zuckerberg and Instagram cofounder Kevin Systrom agreed on facts, but their interpretations were Mars and Venus. In 2012, Instagram was about to close a $500 million investment round, when suddenly the tiny company found itself in play, with Facebook in hot pursuit. In an email at the time, Facebook’s CFO asked Zuckerberg if his goal was to “neutralize a potential competitor.” The answer was affirmative. That was not the way he pitched it to Systrom and cofounder Mike Krieger. Zuckerberg promised the cofounders they would control Instagram and could grow it their way. They would have the best of both worlds—independence and Facebook’s huge resources. Oh, and Facebook’s $1 billion offer was double the valuation of the company in the funding round it was about to close. Everything worked great for a few years, but then Zuckerberg began denying resources to Instagram, which its cofounders had built into a juggernaut. Systrom testified that Zuckerberg seemed envious of Instagram’s success and cultural currency, saying that his boss “believed we were hurting Facebook’s growth.” Zuckerberg’s snubs ultimately drove Instagram's founders to leave in 2018. By that time, Instagram was arguably worth perhaps 100 times Zuckerberg’s purchase price. Systrom and Krieger’s spoils, though considerable, did not reflect the fantastic value they had built for Facebook. The founders of WhatsApp did reap a stratospheric buyout, because in 2014 Zuckerberg threw $19 billion to acquire their then tiny operation. But, as told through testimony of some of its executives and funders, the acquisition hinged on promises that cofounders Brian Acton and Jan Koum would retain control. The WhatsApp cofounders hated advertising and were adamant that no ads should ever appear on their service. But documents introduced in the trial indicated that Facebook was basing its valuation on the premise that WhatsApp would be monetized, apparently with those despised ads. The founders left in 2018, when it became clear that Zuckerberg was calling the shots. “I espoused a certain set of principles, even publicly, to my users, and I said, Look, we are not gonna sell your data, we are not going to sell you ads, and I turned around and sold my company,” cofounder Brian Acton told me. His penance for this “crime,” he told me, was spending $50 million to create the Signal Foundation. Though these founders were pressured to sell, there weren’t literal guns to their heads—and they did cash out in exchange for pursuing their dreams. So we shouldn’t feel too sorry for them. But lately people in Silicon Valley have been chattering about startup guru Paul Graham’s “Founder Mode” theory, which assumes that the person most responsible for creating a company is the best one to run it—and that the world itself benefits from such people. Zuckerberg, of course, is an iconic founder. But the trial is revealing a narrative beyond the FTC’s legal argument about anticompetitive acquisitions: Zuckerberg’s penchant for snuffing out founders to advance his own goals. Of course, sometimes founders are well advised to take the money and run. Consider the case of Clubhouse, the audio-based social networking product that exploded during the pandemic. Its founders, Paul Davison and Rohan Seth, fended off multiple suitors, including a rumored $4 billion offer from Twitter. But after the pandemic—and some poor strategic choices—the service deflated like a punctured balloon. In 2023 it laid off half of its staff. On the other hand, it’s still around, and at least in one of its recent town halls, Davison still seemed to be having fun. One question that Mark Zuckerberg did not have to answer during his testimony was how he viewed his own transition from prey to predator. But I did pose that question to him during my book research. We were discussing the mental anguish he suffered during the 2006 crisis. Zuckerberg told me that he often advises young founders not to give in to pressure. This advice, of course, was not offered to those running companies he wanted to buy. So I asked him directly—given his lesson from the Yahoo experience, did Systrom and Krieger make a mistake by selling to him? There was a long pause, not an uncommon phenomenon when Zuckerberg considers a question where a candid answer might put him in a damning position. Finally he gave a response that dodged the issue, saying that Instagram could never have reached its heights without Facebook’s support. He said pretty much the same thing in court this month. On a legal basis, Meta will not be judged on how he bought off the dreams of founders, but whether he gamed the marketplace through his purchases. No judge will rule on the calculus of selling off a dream. In Kevin Systrom’s testimony, he opined that Zuckerberg denied resources to Instagram in part out of jealousy. The photo-sharing app, which he didn’t invent, was growing faster than Facebook’s blue app, a Mark Zuckerberg Production. When reporting Facebook: The Inside Story, I became familiar with this tension and put it to Zuckerberg: Was he in fact jealous of the Instagram team? “Jealous…” he repeated. Yes, I said. And that you would prefer growth of Facebook’s Blue app to Instagram’s? He said no, and explained to me how he thought about it. Early on … it made sense to leave the founders alone and let them build their best products. “That was incredibly successful,” he says. “And it made sense for the first five years. But now we’re at the point where all the products are big and important. I don’t want to build just multiple versions of the same product. We should have a more coherent and integrated product strategy.” And if that meant losing founders, so be it. “I can understand if you’re an entrepreneur who built one of those things and had awesome success, you’d wake up and say, ‘Okay, I’m proud of what I did, but this isn’t for me going forward.’ That’s how I see it, and we’re going in the right direction.” Those close to Kevin Systrom, though, believe that had Zuckerberg not asserted control, he would have remained at Instagram for 20 more years. Jim asks, “What was it like interviewing some of the pioneers of modern-day computing for Hackers?” Thanks for the question, Jim. You are asking me to access the feelings I had over 40 years ago when I was talking first-hand to people who are now legends. But in the circles I traveled they were virtually unknown, even computer science pioneers like Marvin Minsky and John McCarthy. And to my knowledge no reporter had documented the world of MIT hackers, who pretty much invented computer culture. I do recall as the interviews accumulated, I came to realize that the story I was telling was significant and would have continuing relevance. Also, some of them outright stretched my mind. These people were so interesting that after the book was published I kept talking to computer folk. I still am. Submit your questions in the comments below, or send an email to mail@wired.com.

Title: Market Volatility And Monday Morning Quarterbacks
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/jjkinahan/2025/04/25/market-volatility-and-monday-morning-quarterbacks/
Time Published: 2025-04-25T13:49:08Z
Full Content:
ByJJ Kinahan ByJJ Kinahan, Senior Contributor. Google announced earnings that were better than expected, however, the company warned of headwinds ... More because of tariffs. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images) Updated, April 25, 2025: This post has been adjusted to correct the spelling of Procter & Gamble. Key Takeaways Stocks staged a broad rally on Thursday, led by tech stocks. The Nasdaq Composite gained 2.75%. That was followed by both the S&P 500 and Russell 2000, both gaining 2%. Meantime, the Dow Jones Industrial Average notched a gain of 1.2%. Ten of the 11 S&P sectors closed higher with Consumer Staples being the only sector to close lower. As we get further into earnings season, we’re seeing a continuation of something that began with United Airlines. Companies are struggling when it comes to forecasting in this environment. Alphabet, who beat on their earnings report, said tariffs will be a headwind. American Airlines, PepsiCo, Procter & Gamble, and others have all specifically called out the unique nature of the current geopolitical situation and economic policies being implemented. We’re also seeing massive shifts in supply chains. Apple recently announced it hopes to move most iPhone production to India by 2026. I expect these types of announcements and changes will continue as we get earnings reports from more household-type names. Right now, the only trend to this market is that there is no trend. Technicians and fundamentalists are all struggling to make heads or tails of what is happening. That makes for a challenging situation. Therefore, I think it's important to take a step back here and discuss the broader trading and investing environment as well as how it might make sense to approach the market. We are seeing a heightened level of volatility sustain itself. Even if you are not someone who trades options, this is important because higher volatility means the expected trading ranges for stocks will be wider. It was just a few months ago when the expected move in the S&P 500 was +/- 50 points for a week. Friday alone the expected move in the S&P 500 is over 60 points and looking to next week, the expected move is over 170 points. Those large, expected moves in the index trickle down to individual stocks as well. Apple has an expected move Friday of $4 whereas a couple months ago, expected moves of the day were half that. Large moves have practical implications for both investors and traders. If you are someone who invests in stocks and does dollar cost averaging, you’ll want to take the wider trading ranges into consideration. If you were buying more stock anytime price fell 1%, you may now want to wait for 1.5% to 2%. You should also expect a greater volatility in your account value when market volatility is higher. At the moment, with the VIX around 27, the market's daily expected moves are around 1.5x historical averages. If you have a portfolio that is closely correlated to the market, expect your daily swings to be larger. If you are an options trader, a higher volatility market is what you want. Option premium is what we call, “rich.” What that means is, if you could normally collect $5 selling something like a put that expires in a month, you can now collect $7.50 to $10. Greater volatility means people are willing to pay more for options, this of course makes sense with puts to many people, as you see the downside protection. But those short calls, be it in a covered call or spread, may not go down as much as expected. Again, higher volatility, means that a wider range of stock movement (both up and down) is expected, so all options hold more premium. One of the most important things when volatility is like this is keeping position size small and defining your risk before you place a trade. These types of markets will bring out a lot of Monday-morning quarterbacks, meaning it'll be easy to say what you should have done. Before you go beating yourself up with what you should have sold or should have bought, remind yourself that there is an emotional aspect of trading. I've been doing this my entire adult life and I still succumb to the emotional aspects at times. Therefore, understanding your risk tolerance ahead of time is crucial, it helps take as much emotion as possible out of the trade as you have already walked through mentally, what can go wrong. For today, I'm keeping an eye on volatility. Some of the more esoteric measures of volatility actually have come down over the past few days, and ideally, we'll see that carry over into the VIX. However, next week is a big week for economic data and earnings. The Personal Consumption Expenditures report and employment for April are just two of the many economic reports due. Then companies like Apple and Meta Platforms, among a number of other companies, are scheduled to announce earnings. Therefore, I'm not so sure we'll see that VIX contraction just yet. As always, I would stick with your investing plan and long-term objectives. tastytrade, Inc. commentary for educational purposes only.

ByDanielle Chemtob andForbes Daily ByDanielle Chemtob, Forbes Staff andForbes Daily, Forbes Staff. The rise of AI has also driven a surge in its use for nefarious purposes. But Atlanta-based startup Pindrop just hit a new milestone helping fight the increase in fraud that the technology has brought. After more than 10 years in business, the firm surpassed $100 million in annual recurring revenue, and such growth is driven by its efforts to fight deepfakes—digitally created hoax recordings, images or videos. CEO Vijay Balasubramaniyan said the company has seen a 111% increase in deepfake-related fraud attempts since 2022. The company even had a moment in the spotlight last year: It identified a fraudulent robocall impersonating former President Joe Biden’s voice that was used in New Hampshire to discourage Democrats from voting. Tesla’s stock surged despite the company posting some of its worst quarterly results in years this week, as Elon Musk said he would step back from his DOGE duties. But even if Musk becomes a more active CEO again, the problems the EV maker faces—like declining profit margins, intensifying competition and a tarnished brand image—aren’t going away anytime soon. Worse, it’s becoming clear Musk has run out of ideas for how to fix them, writes Forbes senior editor Alan Ohnsman. Just one hour after Forbes released an investigation into metaverse company Infinite Reality, which had previously announced a massive $3 billion fundraise from a single anonymous investor, the company revealed the investor’s identity. The company said the investment was “represented by” Sterling Select, a venture firm affiliated with Sterling Equities, whose cofounders are former principal owners of the New York Mets and prominent figures in the New York real estate industry—and known for their ties to Bernie Madoff. Sterling Equities’ general counsel denied any involvement with the funding round. The Chinese government may exempt some goods from its 125% tariff rate on all U.S. imports over reported concerns about the economic impact of the steep levies—imposed in response to Washington’s “reciprocal” tariffs. It would follow a similar carve out made by the Trump Administration earlier this month for certain items like Chinese-made smartphones and laptops. In a sign of the shifting cultural tides, 39% of companies said they would scale back on engagement for LGBTQ Pride Month this June, a survey from Gravity Research found. The executives surveyed from top companies cited conservative activists and President Donald Trump, who has waged a war on DEI and targeted the transgender community. Google CEO Sundar Pichai dpa/picture alliance via Getty Images Google parent company Alphabet topped earnings expectations as it was the first of the trillion-dollar U.S. technology giants to report results from an uncertain first quarter. Google stock jumped about 4% in after-hours trading immediately following the release, and Amazon, Apple, Meta and Microsoft are expected to report their earnings next week. The White House is reportedly considering a number of proposals to incentivize Americans to have children amid declining birth rates in the U.S., including a potential $5,000 “baby bonus.” When asked about the proposal, President Donald Trump called the bonus a “good idea,” though it would need to be approved by Congress. After President Donald Trump suggested it on Truth Social, the Trump Organization fired its ethics attorney, whom Harvard University hired to help with its lawsuit against the federal government. The Trump Organization began working with attorney William Burck in January to help prevent conflicts of interest between the company and Trump’s presidency, but the move to fire him raises questions about Trump’s independence from his business empire. Talk to any financial advisor these days, and he or she is likely to have a strong opinion about something known as “structured notes.” These complex products are sold as the “have your cake and eat it” investments of the wealth management world. Their specialty is flexibility—some are geared toward growth and others toward income. Returns are capped and in all cases the goal is to limit downside risk. They are manufactured by big banks like JPMorgan using derivatives, and are often sold as “stock market-linked” with “sleep well at night” protection. They come with maturities ranging from six months to five years, provide principal protection and sometimes offer annual yields of 10% or more. Up until the last few years, structured notes were mostly the domain of hedge funds and other sophisticated investors or ultra-wealthy clients. But thanks to clever engineering, the notes are now being offered by scores of brokers and sold in bite-sized $1,000 increments. The current market volatility and uncertainty has caused them to surge in popularity. Last year the broker-sold U.S. structured notes market reached a record high of nearly $150 billion, up 46% from the previous year, according to London’s Deriva Intelligence. JPMorgan was the top issuer in 2024, followed closely by the likes of Citi, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Barclays. WHY IT MATTERS "The surge in downside protection securities signals a proactive approach by both advisors and investors in response to today's market uncertainty,” says Forbes staff writer Sergei Klebnikov. “As these complex products which seek to limit losses become increasingly accessible, it's imperative that investors understand the nuances of different costs and risks involved." MORE The Best Ways To Profit From, And Safeguard Against, Market Volatility Ultra-low price retailers Shein and Temu said they would raise prices Friday in response to President Donald Trump’s hefty China tariffs. Neither firm said which products would see increases or by how much: 145%: The current tariff rate on goods from China, though Trump has said such rates would “come down substantially” $38 billion: The amount in total sales Shein reported in 2024, up 19% from the previous year $2: The price of a pair of Shein earrings promoted in a video from a TikTok user that highlighted deals to take advantage of Although it might feel intimidating, it’s important to ask your boss questions that can help fast-track your career. One key question that will help show you’re willing to go above and beyond is: “What problems are you working on that I can help with?” And don’t just say that you want a promotion—ask for their input on how you can get there.

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. Fastened seatbelt during a flight. Inside a Ryanair low cost budget airline in the European route ... More FR1818 from Thessaloniki Makedonia Airport SKG LGTS in Greece to Eindhoven Airport EIN EHEH in the Netherlands. (Photo by Nicolas Economou/NurPhoto via Getty Images) It offers better returns than your bank savings, ignores market crashes, and is tailored for the new economic landscape. Who are we referring to? It’s TransDigm Group (NYSE:TDG). Still overlooking it? We understand. It’s not an exciting tech name or a new AI superstar. It may seem dull. However, this is precisely the tactical error you should sidestep if you aim to grow your wealth. Evading significant fluctuations is crucial for wealth accumulation. The High-Quality portfolio, which aims to minimize volatility while providing compounding upside, has surpassed the S&P 500 and achieved returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Let’s see if you still consider TDG stock unexciting after what we’ll share. You’ve heard enough about tech stocks that fluctuate like trapeze artists. But what if there exists a stock that offers tech-like returns without the chaotic movements? One that provides you with a 5.5% dividend– right now – and possesses the strength to increase that payout continuously? Introducing the defense stock that quietly exceeds expectations – TDG At 5.5%, this dividend outperforms most savings accounts, money markets, and even Treasuries. But here’s the catch – this dividend isn’t a “set-it-and-forget-it” yield. It has momentum behind it. What does this signify? This isn’t merely a dividend investment – it’s a cash-generating machine with growth potential. With healthy margins and swift revenue growth, dividends are set to increase as well. This implies that yields could rise or stay consistent as the stock price appreciates. Either way – you benefit! You enjoy growing income year after year. Many income stocks offer substantial dividends. Few provide them in conjunction with stability and capital appreciation. Contrast that with your favorite tech stocks. Nvidia: -62% in 2022, Meta: -75% drop from peak to trough, and Tesla – well, let’s not even discuss that. With this defense investment, you’re compounding quietly and steadily. And guess what – with its impressive margins, robust cash flow, and a DE ratio of 30%, this stock has considerable capacity to manage increased interest costs as debts are refinanced at higher yields in the coming years. This indicates that the risk to dividend growth is minimal. Think defense stocks are dull? Think again. Tariffs have returned. U.S.-China tensions are rising. The new industrial policy wave (whether called re-shoring, de-risking, or “Make America Build Again”) represents a favorable environment for defense expenses. Defense firms are not only safeguarded – they are positioned to prosper. And TDG has remained steadfast during market crises in the past. However, as the saying goes – never put all your eggs in one basket. The Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio is crafted to diversify stock-specific risks while providing access to potential growth. With a collection of 30 stocks, it has consistently outperformed the S&P 500 over the past 4 years. Why is that? Collectively, HQ Portfolio stocks have delivered superior returns with reduced risk compared to the benchmark index; experiencing less volatility, as shown in HQ Portfolio performance metrics

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / APRIL 25 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks.

President Donald Trump at the White House on April 22, 2025, in front of a painting depicting the aftermath of the assassination attempt last July in Butler, Pa. President Donald Trump sat down for an interview with TIME at the White House on April 22. Over the course of the interview, Trump discussed a wide range of issues, including his trade war and the economy, immigration, presidential power, and the situations in Ukraine and the Middle East. Below is a lightly edited transcript of the interview conducted by TIME Senior Political Correspondent Eric Cortellessa and Editor-in-Chief Sam Jacobs. Click here to read our fact check. Advertisement Advertisement TIME: Obviously, a lot has happened. We want to have a conversation about what your first 100 days have looked like in office. And we want to try to touch on as many different points as we can. Trump: There’s a lot, right? A lot of things happening. You know better than anyone that the President of the United States is the most powerful person in the world. At the same time, it seems like you are expanding the power of the presidency. Why do you think you need more power? Well, I don't feel I'm expanding it. I think I'm using it as it was meant to be used. I feel that we've had a very successful presidency in 100 days. We've had people writing it was the best first month and best second month, and really the best third month. But that you won't know about for a little while, because it takes a little time in transition. You know, we're resetting a table. We were losing $2 trillion a year on trade, and you can't do that. I mean, at some point somebody has to come along and stop it, because it's not sustainable. We were carrying other countries on our back with, you know, with trade numbers, with horrible numbers, and we've changed it. You see the market fluctuates quite a bit. Today, it's up 1,000 or 1,200 points. It goes up and down, but that will steady out, and we're taking in tremendous amounts of money. We have, as you know, already, 25% on cars, 25% on steel and aluminum— Mr. President, I think what we’re driving at is that you've taken congressional authority on trade and appropriations. You fired the heads of independent agencies. You're challenging the courts right now, as you know. You're using the levers of government to weaken private institutions like law firms and universities. Isn't this seizing power away from institutions and concentrating them inside the presidency? No, I think that what I'm doing is exactly what I've campaigned on. If you look at what I campaigned on, for instance, you can talk about removing people from the country. We have to do it because Biden allowed people to come in through his open border crazy, insanity. He allowed people to come into our country that we can't have in our country. Many criminals—they emptied their prisons, many countries, almost every country, but not a complete emptying, but some countries a complete emptying of their prison system. But you look all over the world, and I'm not just talking about South America, we're talking about all over the world. People have been led into our country that are very dangerous. If you were walking down the street, and if you happen to be near one of these people, they could, they would kill you, and they wouldn't even think about it. And we can't have that in our country. So you're not concentrating more power in the presidency? I don't think so. I think I'm using it properly, and I'm also using it as per my election. You know, everything that I'm doing—this is what I talked about doing. I said that I'm going to move the criminals out. I saw what was happening early on when I heard that he had open borders, when I, because it was a hard thing to believe. I built hundreds of miles of wall, and then he didn't want to, and we had another, an extra hundred miles that I could have put up because I ordered it as extra. I completed the wall, what I was doing, but we have, I wanted to build additional because it was working so well. An extension. And he didn't want to do that. And when he said he wasn't going to do that, I said, “Well, he must want open borders.” There were sections that were being built. And he stopped to work on it, and I said, this guy actually wants to have open borders. That's going to be a tragedy for our country. That's going to mean that other countries will release into our country some very rough people. We’d love to come back to immigration but maybe start with the economy. Obviously an issue you campaigned on as well. You promised that you would immediately bring down prices and usher in a golden age of America. The prices of gas and eggs have gone down, but the cost of other things remain— The prices of groceries have gone down. The only price that hasn't gone down is the price of energy. The cost of energy, I'm sorry, well, energy has gone down, excuse me. Let me change that—is the interest rates. And interest rates have essentially stayed the same. But almost every other thing, I mean, you take a look at what's going on, and this is, we're taking in billions of dollars of tariffs, by the way. And just to go back to the past, I took in hundreds of billions of dollars of tariffs from China, and then when COVID came, I couldn't institute the full program, but I took in hundreds of billions, and we had no inflation. But let’s focus on what is happening right now because— We took in billions of dollars, we had no inflation. Now, if you take a look, the price of groceries are down. The price of energy is down. Inflation remains pretty much the same. And the IMF is saying it’s going to go up. No, Eric, you can't say what they think, because so far what I thought is right. I've been right about— 401ks are down. The Atlanta Fed says our economy is contracting -2.2% during quarter one. Well, they may have said that, but so far, they've been, I mean, I've been right. If you look at all of the years that I've been doing this, I've been right on things. You're gonna—you're gonna have the wealthiest country we've ever had, and you're gonna have an explosion upward in the not-too-distant future. You know, I've been here now for three months, and I inherited eggs, I inherited groceries, I inherited energy. It was all going through the roof. And we had the highest inflation we've ever had as a country, or very close to it. And I believe it was the highest ever. Somebody said it's the highest in only 48 years. That's a lot, too, but I believe we had the highest inflation we've ever had. I've been here now for three months. And three months, we are taking in billions and billions of dollars from other countries that we never took in before. And that's just the start. Well let’s talk about the tariffs. You want companies to build and make goods here in America. Not in all cases. There are some products I really don't want to make here. Like t-shirts? I can’t–I can give you a list because I actually have a list, but if you want, I could give it to you. Well, I mean, the question is, how can CEOs make long-term plans and investments if our tariff policy can change from day to day and still remains so uncertain? How can they make long-term investments? I'll turn it around. How can they make long-term investments if our country is losing $2 trillion a year on trade? Will you consider giving exemptions— No wait, just so you understand. How can we sustain and how is it sustainable that our country lost almost $2 trillion on trade in Biden years, in this last year. That's not—when you talk about a company. I had the head of Walmart yesterday, right in that seat. I had the head of Walmart. I had the head of Home Depot and the head of Target in my office. And I'll tell you what they think, they think what I'm doing is exactly right. Well, the CEOs of small businesses are saying they may not be able to last another two months with the current regime in place. Will you consider giving small businesses an exemption similar to what you've given to Big Tech? I’d have to look at the individual business. Would you consider it? Our country is going to be very rich in not a long period of time. I've been doing this for three months, and if you look at the kind of numbers that we're taking in and the jobs, and if you look at, more importantly, the companies, the chip companies, the car companies, the Apple. $500 billion. Apple is investing $500 billion in building plants. They never invested in this country. Small businesses are worried that you’re treating the Apples of the world better than you’re treating them. No, I’m treating small businesses—small businesses will be a bigger beneficiary of what I'm doing than than the large businesses. But everybody's going to benefit. If we still have high tariffs, whether it's 20% or 30% or 50%, on foreign imports a year from now, will you consider that a victory? Total victory. Why so? Because the country will be making a fortune. Look, that's what China did to us. They charge us 100%. If you look at India—India charges 100-150%. If you look at Brazil, if you look at many, many countries, they charge—that's how they survive. That's how they got rich. Now, zero would be easy. Oh, zero would be easy, but zero, you wouldn't have any companies coming in. They're coming in because they don't want to pay the tariffs. Remember this, there are no tariffs, if they make their product here. There are no tariffs, if they make their product here. There are no tariffs. This is a tremendous success. You just don't know it yet, but this is a tremendous success what’s happening. We're taking in billions and billions of dollars, money that we never took in before. We're also, very importantly, because of that, because of the money we're taking in, those companies are going to come back and they're going to make their product here. They're going to go back into North Carolina and start making furniture again. They've already started. In Mexico, many car plants that were under construction have stopped. They're all coming into this country. We're gonna, you're gonna see car plants going at a level that you've never seen before. Your trade adviser– I'm also—chips. Look at Jensen. Nvidia. He's gonna spend $500 billion. Look at Mr. Wei from Taiwan. Do you trust them when they say that? These businessmen who say, Oh, I'm gonna spend $500 billion. Oh yeah. Well, I’ll tell you why I trust them. First of all, I think they’re trustworthy people. But more importantly, they have no choice, because they won't be able to pay the tariffs if they don't do it. The tariffs are bringing in the business. Remember, with all the, you know, questions you're asking about tariffs, there are no tariffs when you make your product here. Sure, no, I understand, Mr. President— Zero. Your trade adviser, Peter Navarro, says 90 deals in 90 days is possible. We're now 13 days into the point from when you lifted the reciprocal, the discounted reciprocal tariffs. There's zero deals so far. Why is that? No, there’s many deals. When are they going to be announced? You have to understand, I'm dealing with all the companies, very friendly countries. We're meeting with China. We're doing fine with everybody. But ultimately, I've made all the deals. Not one has been announced yet. When are you going to announce them? I’ve made 200 deals. You’ve made 200 deals? 100%. Can you share with whom? Because the deal is a deal that I choose. View it differently: We are a department store, and we set the price. I meet with the companies, and then I set a fair price, what I consider to be a fair price, and they can pay it, or they don't have to pay it. They don't have to do business with the United States, but I set a tariff on countries. Some have been horrible to us. Some have been okay. Nobody's been great. Nobody's been great. Everybody took advantage of us. What I'm doing is I will, at a certain point in the not too distant future, I will set a fair price of tariffs for different countries. These are countries—some of them have made hundreds of billions of dollars, and some of them have made just a lot of money. Very few of them have made nothing because the United States was being ripped off by every, almost every country in the world, in the entire world. So I will set a price, and when I set the price, and I will set it fairly according to the statistics, and according to everything else. For instance, do they have the VAT system in play? Do they charge us tariffs? How much are they charging us? How much have they been charging us? Many, many different factors, right. How are we being treated by that country? And then I will set a tariff. Are we paying for their military? You know, as an example, we have Korea. We pay billions of dollars for the military. Japan, billions for those and others. But that, I'm going to keep us a separate item, the paying of the military. Germany, we have 50,000 soldiers— I’m just curious, why don’t you announce these deals that you’ve solidified? I would say, over the next three to four weeks, and we're finished, by the way. You’re finished? We’ll be finished. Oh, you will be finished in three to four weeks. I’ll be finished. Now, some countries may come back and ask for an adjustment, and I'll consider that, but I'll basically be, with great knowledge, setting—ready? We're a department store, a giant department store, the biggest department store in history. Everybody wants to come in and take from us. They're going to come in and they're going to pay a price for taking our treasure, for taking our jobs, for doing all of these things. But what I'm doing with the tariffs is people are coming in, and they're building at levels you've never seen before. We have $7 trillion of new plants, factories and other things, investment coming into the United States. And if you look back at past presidents, nobody was anywhere near that. And this is in three months. Will you call President Xi if he doesn’t call you? No. You won’t? Nope. Has he called you yet? Yep. When did he call you? He's called. And I don't think that's a sign of weakness on his behalf. But you would think it’s a sign of weakness if you called him? I don’t–I just look— Well, what did he say? If people want to–well, we all want to make deals. But I am this giant store. It's a giant, beautiful store, and everybody wants to go shopping there. And on behalf of the American people, I own the store, and I set prices, and I'll say, if you want to shop here, this is what you have to pay. This period of uncertainty will be over in three to four weeks? I don’t think there’s any uncertainty there. The only thing—they have an option. They don't have to shop here. They can go someplace else, but there aren't too many places they can go. You understand what I mean though? Sure. Your Treasury Secretary says this situation with China is unsustainable. Oh I agree. You mean the way it is now? Yes. Or the way it was before I got here? The current moment, too, he believes is unsustainable. Well, no, they won’t do any business here, because at 145% it's going to be very rare that you see business. But your conversations with Xi have made you feel like we’re moving towards a more productive— Oh, there’s a number at which they will feel comfortable. Yeah. But you can’t let them make a trillion dollars from us. You can’t let them make $750 billion. See, that’s really what’s not sustainable when China makes a trillion dollars, or a trillion one, when we have almost $2 trillion worth of, I call it loss. Some people don't, but a lot of it’s loss. I say, when you have a trade deficit of $2 trillion I consider that loss. Mr. President, there was a period of time on April 9 when the bond market was under extreme stress and there was a risk of a financial crisis far beyond what the plummeting stock market suggested. I wasn’t worried. What did your advisers tell you, though? You were in the Oval Office with Scott Bessent and Howard Lutnick. What did they tell you to convince you to lift the reciprocal tariffs for the 90-day pause? They didn’t tell me. I did that. What made you decide? It wasn’t for that reason. It wasn’t for the bond market? No, it wasn’t for that reason. I'm doing that until we come up with the numbers that I want to come up with. I've met with a lot of countries. I've talked on the telephone. I don’t even want them to come in. You said the bond market was getting the yips. The bond market was getting the yips, but I wasn’t. Because I know what we have. I know what we have, but I also know we won't have it for long if we allowed four more years of the gross incompetence. This thing was just running—it was running as a free spirit. This was—this was the most incompetent president in history. In our interview last year, Mr. President, you committed to complying with all Supreme Court orders. I said what? You committed to complying with all Supreme Court orders— Yeah. When you and I spoke last April. Are you still committed to complying with all Supreme Court orders? Sure, I believe in the court system. The Supreme Court ruled 9-0 that you have to bring back Kilmar Abrego Garcia. You haven't done so. Aren’t you disobeying the Supreme Court? Well, that’s not what my people told me—they didn’t say it was, they said it was—the nine to nothing was something entirely different. Let me quote from the ruling. “The order properly requires the government to facilitate Abrego Garcia's release from custody in El Salvador.” Are you facilitating a release? I leave that to my lawyers. I give them no instructions. They feel that the order said something very much different from what you're saying. But I leave that to my lawyers. If they want—and that would be the Attorney General of the United States and the people that represent the country. I don't make that decision. Have you asked President Bukele to return him? I haven’t, uh, he said he wouldn’t. Did you ask him? But I haven’t asked him positively, but he said he wouldn’t. But if you haven't asked him, then how are you facilitating his release? Well, because I haven't been asked to ask him by my attorneys. Nobody asked me to ask him that question, except you. Do you believe he deserves his day in court? I believe that they made him look like a saint, and then we found out about him. He wasn't a saint. He was MS-13. He was a wife beater and he had a lot of things that were very bad, you know, very, very bad. When I first heard of the situation, I was not happy, and then I found out that he was a person who was an MS-13 member. And in fact, he had a tattooed right on his—I'm sure you saw that—he had it tattooed right on his knuckles: MS-13. No, I believe he's a man who has got quite a past. This is no longer just a nice, wonderful man from Maryland, which people, which the fake news had me and other people for a period of time believing. Now, nobody believes that. And I think this isa very bad—I think this is another menwomen’s sports thing for the Democrats. Maybe, but Mr. President, whatever he might have done, whoever he might be affiliated with, doesn’t he deserve his day in court? Nazi saboteurs who came on our shores at Montauk during World War II had their day in court. Al Qaeda terrorists had their day in court. I really give that to my lawyers to determine, that’s why I have them. That’s not my determination. It's something that, frankly, bringing him back and retrying him wouldn't bother me, but I leave that up to my lawyer. You could bring him back and retry him— That’s exactly right. You could fix this simply by bringing him back and going through the legal process— But I leave that decision to the lawyers. At this moment, they just don’t want to do that. They say we’re in total compliance with the Supreme Court. What about the lower courts? Are you committed to complying with lower courts? Sure. All courts. One more question on this, sir. You took an oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution. The Constitution says the Supreme Court is the ultimate authority once they issue a ruling. If you defy them, aren't you violating your oath? I'm not defying the Supreme Court. I never defy the Supreme Court. I wouldn't do that. I'm a big believer in the Supreme Court, and have a lot of respect for the Justices. You asked President Bukele of El Salvador to build out the CECOT prison to house American citizens. You said you would love to send “homegrown criminals” there— No, I didn’t say that. I said if it were permissible according to the law, I would like to do that, yes. Well, do you intend to send American citizens to foreign persons? I would love to do that if it were permissible by law. We're looking into that. When I have a person, these would be extreme cases. When I have a person that is a 28-time in and out person that goes out and tries to kill people every time he or she is out, I would have no problem with doing that whatsoever. We're talking about career criminals that are horrible people that we house and we have to take care of for 50 years while they suffer because they killed people. If you ask me whether or not I would do that, I would, but totally, and I think you have to leave this part of the sentence totally subject to it being allowed under law. And people are looking to see if it would be allowed under law. We have crime rates under Biden that went through the roof, and we have to bring those rates down. And unfortunately, those rates have been added to by the illegal immigrants that he allowed into the country. Which Americans would you do that to? I would do that to people that hit old ladies over the head with a baseball bat, for people that grab their bicycle? You saw that one where they dragged an old woman along the street on a motorcycle, a bicycle, a motorcycle, I think. People that push people into subway trains just before the train is ready to stop. You saw that? The man barely lived. Think of it. And a guy comes up to him, and from behind he pushes him. That's a serious, serious thing. People that shoot people in the back, people that are executioners. Yeah, I would have no trouble with that but subject to it being allowed by law. Do you really want there to be gulags for American citizens in foreign countries? Gulag? You define gulag. Prisons like in the Soviet Union— Look, I see where you’re coming from, from the moment this interview started, and it's fine, I don't mind. I've answered every question that can be answered by mankind or womankind, and I see where you're coming from. Rapid fire. You can't even wait for me to give you the answer. You should let me give you that final answer. Go ahead, sir. No, no, I’m not—I’m just saying, I see where you’re coming from, and you’re just so wrong. You’re so wrong. These are people that have been in jail for 20 times. They're career criminals. Do I have a problem with a career criminal that hits people with baseball bats when they're not looking, that pushes people into subways, that shoots people in the face or in the back? I have absolutely no problem with doing that, if the law allows it to be done and we're looking at it. And one of the reasons I like it is because it would be much less expensive than our prison system, and I think it would actually be a greater deterrent. Sir, on that note, how much are we paying President Bukele for holding those prisoners? I don’t know. I could get you the information, but we’re paying less than we would normally. Did you personally approve those payments? No, I didn’t. Many of the Jan. 6 prisoners you pardoned pleaded guilty to or were convicted of violent crimes as part of the capital attack. Days before you pardoned them, J.D. Vance said “of course” you wouldn't include those who committed violence. What changed? What changed where? At what moment did you decide to include all of the defendants, including the ones who committed violent offenses? Because I've watched in Portland and I watched in Seattle, and I've watched in Minneapolis, Minnesota and other places. People do heinous acts, far more serious than what took place on Jan. 6. And nothing happened to these people. Nothing. And I said, What a double standard it is. And we were talking about a very small group of people that are in your definition, most of these people should have been let out a long time ago. There's never been a group of people, maybe with one exception, I won't even go into it, one exception as a group. But there's never been a group of people that's been treated so horribly as the J6 people. You know, when I say peacefully and patriotically, nobody mentions that. When I say go peacefully and patriotically, nobody ever mentions that. Nobody mentions the fact that the unselect committee of political scum, the unselect committee, horrible people, they destroyed all evidence, they burned it, they got rid of it, they destroyed it, and they deleted all evidence. And we went in looking for evidence, and they said, I'm sorry, we don't have it anymore. It's been destroyed. If I ever did that, it would be unthinkable what you guys, what you two guys, would be doing and writing, but, you know, and nobody wants to talk about it, and you won't write about it, and nobody writes about it. It’s unbelievable, right? But people get it. I mean, people get it. They get what I'm saying, and they obviously believe it, because I had a hell of an election. You campaigned on it, and you won decisively. No and everything I campaigned. If you think of, you know, the way you ask me these questions, like, it's so serious that we're moving people out of the country. I said during the election that I'm going to move them out of the country, and that's what we're doing. Can you talk a little bit about the budget? Yeah. And if we didn't do it, then you two would not be safe. I guarantee it. Some Republicans are considering raising taxes on millionaires in the package you're planning to pass that would extend your 2017 tax cuts. Do you support that idea? Well, I’ll tell ya, I certainly don’t mind having a tax increase, and the only reason I wouldn't support it is because I saw Bush where they said, where he said “Read my lips” and he lost an election. He would have lost it anyway, but he lost an election. He got beat up pretty good. I would be honored to pay more, but I don't want to be in a position where we lose an election because I was generous, but me, as a rich person, would not mind paying and you know, we're talking about very little. We're talking about one point. It doesn't make that much difference, and yet, I could just see somebody trying to bring that up as a subject, and, you know, say, “Oh, he raised taxes.” Well, I wouldn't be, really, you know, in the true sense, I wouldn't. I'd be raising them on wealthy to take care of middle class. And that's—I love, that. I actually love the concept, but I don't want it to be used against me politically, because I've seen people lose elections for less, especially with the fake news. Do you think it would help cover the cost that would be lost from getting rid of taxes on tips and some of these other proposals? Well, that would be able to take it. See, that would be able to do it, but I would not mind personally paying more. But the concept is something that may not be acceptable to the public. Experts estimate that the House Republican budget will result in more than $800 billion in losses to Medicaid over the next 10 years. Do you support that? Due to what? The House Republican budget that would cut roughly $800 billion from Medicaid. I don’t think they’re going to cut $800 billion. They’re going to look at waste, fraud, and abuse. So would you veto a bill if it had cuts to Medicaid? If it was an increase, if we were deducting something from—I would, but it's waste, it's fraud and abuse is what we're looking for. And nobody minds that. If Republicans send you a bill that cuts Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, you commit to vetoing it? If it cuts it, I would not approve. So you would veto that? I would veto it, yeah. But they’re not going to do that. Would you support a ban on congressional stock trading? Well, I watched Nancy Pelosi get rich through insider information, and I would be okay with it. If they send that to me, I would do it. You'll sign it? Absolutely. The FTC is currently trying Meta for maintaining an illegal monopoly by acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp. Do you think more companies need to be broken up? It depends on the company, depends on the market, depends on what the company does. But I think that a lot of companies certainly have been looked at during the Obama and during the Biden regime certainly. Do you think corporate monopolies have hurt average Americans? In some cases, yeah. In some cases, not. I’d like to ask you some questions about DOGE. You've put Elon Musk in charge of this cost-cutting operation. The question is, why is the government, through DOGE, amassing the sensitive personal information about everyday Americans, which was previously stored across different agencies, all in one place? DOGE has been a very big success. We found hundreds of billions of dollars of waste, fraud, and abuse. Billions of dollars being given to politicians, single politicians based on the environment. It's a scam. It's illegal, in my opinion, so much of the stuff that we found, but I think DOGE has been a big success from that standpoint. [An aide interrupts the interview for President Trump to take a phone call from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi] So if we can just come back to the question before the call, which is the database that DOGE is putting together Americans’ information. Why are they doing that? Because we want to find waste, fraud, and abuse, and want to cut our costs. Some officials have described what DOGE is doing is creating a central kind of “God-mode” view into government databases that has been, up until now, intentionally kept separate. The idea, they say, is to basically use this information to advance your policy goals. Is this an accurate characterization? No, that’s inaccurate, as you know. I mean, it’s a crazy question. We just want to find fraud, abuse. We want to find who's on the rolls that shouldn't be, who's getting paid every month by the government that shouldn't be paid. Do these people exist? In many cases, they don't, in some cases, even worse, they do. They've been getting money, and they shouldn't be. What does your administration plan to do with information obtained by the IRS and other agencies as part of the DOGE effort? Well, I don’t know about the IRS, because, as you know, I’m not involved in it, but we’ve found tremendous waste, fraud and abuse. Tremendous. Will any of it be used to track down and round up migrants as part of the deportation operation? Not that I know of, no. Let's talk about the cuts. As you know, Mr. President, a lot of American companies do business with the government. The DOGE cuts aren't just affecting government employees. They're also affecting American businesses that provide goods and services to the federal government. There were nearly 280,000 layoffs in March across virtually every sector. Why is it better for these people to be out of jobs? Because we have to have an efficient country. And when the country gets down to bare knuckles, you're going to see, you're going to see something the likes of which this world has never seen before. We're going to make our country strong, powerful, and very rich again. Right now, our country is not sustainable. We're being ripped off by everybody in the world, other countries, other people, other militaries, are ripping us off. We're protecting countries for no money or for very minimal money, and that wasn't supposed to happen. We're not supposed to be protecting everybody. We're supposed to be, number one, taking care of ourself, and number two, helping people when we can, helping outside people and outside countries where we can. But we've been ripped off by levels that you've never seen. European Union sounds nice, but they've been very tough. $300 billion loss. China—hundreds of billions of dollars in losses. And I can go through a list, but I don't want to, because there are many friendly countries, our friendly countries, in many cases, are worse than our enemies. And it's not a sustainable model. It's not a sustainable possibility even, that a country can go through that and Biden let it get to a level that is seriously dangerous. Well, many Americans certainly agree with you that they want to get rid of government fraud, waste, and abuse. They want to shrink the federal— It’s not only government. It’s deals. It's horrible deals that have been made with other countries. As an example, China has been ripping us off for many years, until I came along. I raised, I upped tariffs on China, hundreds of billions of dollars. We've done hundreds of billions, hundreds. But domestically, for instance, your administration blocked grants for the National Institutes of Health that funded research into infectious diseases, cancers, Alzheimer's— Well maybe we didn't think they were right. You know, I mean, you look at the people, look at the money that was given away by others. We didn't get anything out of it. Well what do you tell the families and people who are suffering from those diseases? We're taking care of—we're spending a lot. I spent 58—we spent, let's see, I think $58 billion in the first term. We were spending tremendous amounts of money, and I am now, but they have to be a little bit careful. A lot of the money like Stacey Abrams got $2 billion on the environment. They had $100 in the account and she got $2 billion just before these people left—and had to do with something that she knows nothing about. NIH is the world’s largest funder of cancer research— Shouldn’t they be asking those questions? I could give you a list of abuse and waste and fraud, and you don't have any interest in hearing it. I mean, I just see by these questions, just wondering, with all of the bad things that have happened, with all of the things we found, you have no interest in those things. You only have an interest. So what about this? What about that? Our country is going to be strong again because of what we're doing, and this is not a sustainable model, what we're looking at. And I think very importantly, I had a great election. Won all seven swing states, won millions and millions of votes. Won millions of votes. They say it was the most consequential election in 129 years. I don't know if that's right, but it was certainly a big win, and that's despite cheating that took place, by the way, because there was plenty of cheating that took place. In ‘24? ‘24, yeah. ‘20, of course. But ‘24 also, they tried. They tried that. They did their best. It's the only thing they're good at. But we're gonna have a great country again. Just remember, every single question you're asking, I campaigned on it. I campaigned on all the things you're talking about, all the things you're asking about, and openly campaigned. And we're given credit, even by radical left lunatics. We are given credit for that. We're given credit for saying, This is what I'm going to do. If you look at your questions, that's what I campaigned on. Following that call, I'd love to hear a little bit about the role that you're playing on the world stage. And I think that you campaigned on that too. It’s interesting because you see the relationship. I didn't want to wait, you know, have you leave the room, but you see the relationship. I have that relationship with many leaders. If I can stop losing 3,000 human beings a week on average, with Russia, Ukraine, it's only because of me, nobody else could have stopped it. I think we're going to do that, by the way. I think that'll be done. I think that we're going to make a deal with Iran. I think we're going to make a deal with Iran. Nobody else could do that. You said you would end the war in Ukraine on Day One. Well, I said that figuratively, and I said that as an exaggeration, because to make a point, and you know, it gets, of course, by the fake news [unintelligible]. Obviously, people know that when I said that, it was said in jest, but it was also said that it will be ended. Well what’s taking so long? When do you think it will be ended? Well, I don’t think it’s long. I mean, look, I got here three months ago. This war has been going on for three years. It's a war that would have never happened if I was president. It's Biden's war. It’s not my war. I have nothing to do with it. I would have never had this war. This war would have never happened. Putin would have never done it. This war would have never happened. Oct. 6 would have never happened. Oct. 7 would have never happened. Would have never happened. Ever. You then say, what’s taking so long? Do you hear this, Steve? The war has been raging for three years. I just got here, and you say, what's taken so long? Do you think peace is still possible if Putin is President? I think peace is possible. You say if Putin is still president? Yeah, if Putin is President. Can there be peace if Putin is President of Russia? I think with me as president, there's—possible, if very probable. If somebody else is president, no chance. If Putin can make peace? Yeah, I think Putin will. I think Putin would rather do it a different way. I think he’d rather go and take the whole thing. And I think that because of me, I believe I'm the only one that can get this thing negotiated. And I think we’re a long way. We've had very good talks, and we're getting very close to a deal. And I don't believe anybody else could have made that deal. Do you believe peace is possible if Zelensky is still President of Ukraine? Yeah, I do. He is president now and I think we’re going to make a deal. Should Ukraine give up any hope of ever joining NATO? I don’t think they’ll ever be able to join NATO. I think that's been—from day one, I think that's been, that's I think what caused the war to start was when they started talking about joining NATO. If that weren't brought up, there would have been a much better chance that it wouldn’t have started. Should Crimea go to the Russians? Should they get to keep Crimea? Well, Crimea went to the Russians. It was handed to them by Barack Hussein Obama, and not by me. With that being said, will they be able to get it back? They've had their Russians. They've had their submarines there for long before any period that we're talking about, for many years. The people speak largely Russian in Crimea. But this was given by Obama. This wasn't given by Trump. Would it have been taken from me like it was taken from Obama? No, it wouldn't have happened. Crimea, if I were president, it would not have been taken. Would it be acceptable to you in a deal if Crimea and the four other regions that Russia has taken from Ukraine would be folded into Russia under a final accommodation? If Crimea will stay with Russia—we have to only talk about Crimea because that's the one that always gets mentioned. Crimea will stay with Russia. And Zelensky understands that, and everybody understands that it's been with them for a long time. It's been with them long before Trump came along. Again, this is Obama's war. This is a war that should have never happened. I call it the war that should have never happened. You’ve talked about improving relations with Moscow. Are you pursuing negotiations with them on issues other than Ukraine? No— Like nuclear weapons stockpiles or testing? But if a deal has happened, I can see us doing business with Ukraine and with Russia as a country. You've talked about acquiring Greenland, taking control of the Panama Canal, making Canada the 51st state. Maybe you're trolling a little bit on that one. I don't know. Actually, no, I’m not. Well, do you want to grow the American empire? Well, it depends as an empire, it wasn't, these are not things that we had before, so I'd view it a little bit differently if we had the right opportunity. Yeah, I think Greenland would be very well off if they I think it's important for us for national security and even international security. I think Canada, what you said that, “Well, that one, I might be trolling.” But I'm really not trolling. Canada is an interesting case. We lose $200 to $250 billion a year supporting Canada. And I asked a man who I called Governor Trudeau. I said, ”Why? Why do you think we're losing so much money supporting you? Do you think that's right? Do you think that's appropriate for another country to make it possible, for a country to sustain and he was unable to give me an answer, but it costs us over $200 billion a year to take care of Canada?” We’re taking care of their military. We're taking care of every aspect of their lives, and we don't need them to make cars for us. In fact, we don't want them to make cars for us. We want to make our own cars. We don't need their lumber. We don't need their energy. We don't need anything from Canada. And I say the only way this thing really works is for Canada to become a state. Steven Cheung: We’re coming up on time, about 10 minutes. Okay, we'll move quickly then. Last note: Do you want to be remembered as a president who expanded American territory? Wouldn’t mind. One more question on the cuts, sir. You've made cuts to homeland security, cyber defenses, the Nuclear Security Administration, your FBI chief is pushing to shift the bureau from domestic intelligence to criminal investigation. These are programs that were set up after September 11 to prevent terrorist attacks. Are you worried that this could be making America more vulnerable to an attack? No. America will be much stronger. If we are attacked, do you risk being blamed for letting down our defenses? What does that mean? If we are subject to an attack, do you risk being blamed because of these cuts? I think I'll be blamed no matter what. I think if I make the country unbelievably successful, which it's not now, we owe $36 trillion right? It's, you know, when you think about it, a lot of money, a lot of money, but, but no, I think I'll be, I'll be blamed whether it's successful or not. I'm used to it. You may be right about that. UNICEF says that more than 300 children have been killed and more than 600 have been wounded since the ceasefire in Gaza broke down. Who is to blame for those deaths? I would say that the blame for that is Biden more than anybody else, because I had, as you know, Iran was broke, and he allowed them to become rich— More than Hamas? There was no money for Hamas. There was no money for Hezbollah. There was no money. Iran was broke under Trump, and you know that, he knows that, broke. They had no money, and they told Hamas, we're not giving you any money. When Biden came and he took off all the sanctions, he let China and everybody else buy all the oil, Iran developed $300 billion in cash over a four year period. They started funding terror again, including Hamas. Hamas was out of business. Hezbollah was out of business. Iran had no money under me. I blame the Biden administration, because they allowed Iran to get back into the game without working a deal. You’ve begun direct talks with Iran. Are you open to meeting with Iran’s President or Supreme Leader? Sure. You reportedly stopped Israel from attacking Iran's nuclear sites. That's not right. It’s not right? No, it’s not right. I didn’t stop them. But I didn't make it comfortable for them, because I think we can make a deal without the attack. I hope we can. It's possible we'll have to attack because Iran will not have a nuclear weapon. But I didn't make it comfortable for them, but I didn't say no. Ultimately I was going to leave that choice to them, but I said I would much prefer a deal than bombs being dropped. Are you worried Netanyahu will drag you into a war? No. Let’s talk about some of the issues with universities— By the way, he may go into a war. But we’re not getting dragged in. The U.S. will stay out of it if Israel goes into it? No, I didn’t say that. You asked if he’d drag me in, like I’d go in unwillingly. No, I may go in very willingly if we can't get a deal. If we don't make a deal, I'll be leading the pack. You're planning your first major foreign trip for your second term to the Middle East next month. What are the last hurdles for Saudi Israeli normalization? Well, what I want, and the reason I'm doing it, is because Saudi Arabia, I happen to like the people very much, and the Crown Prince and the King—I like all of them, but they've agreed to invest a trillion dollars in our economy. $1 trillion. I'm then going to Qatar, and I'm then going to UAE, and then I'm coming back, and then we're making another. I think our foreign policy has been incredible, and it was before, and it is now. You sort of got a little glimpse of it. Are you closer to a Saudi-Israeli normalization deal than you were before? I have very good relationships in the Middle East, and I think all over the world. I think it's—well, the smarter people understand. I have stopped—I have solved more problems in the world without asking for or getting credit. This would be a big one. Which one? Saudi-Israeli normalization. You had the Abraham Accords, one of your, you know, historic accomplishments— Unfortunately, they did nothing. They did nothing with the Abraham Accords. We had four countries in there, it was all set. We would have had it packed. Now we're going to start it again. The Abraham Accords is a tremendous success, but Biden just sat with it. Can you build on it to get the Saudi-Israeli normalization deal? Well, I tell you what: I think Saudi Arabia will go into the Abraham Accords. Yeah? Yeah, and by the way, I think it will be full very quickly. It would be a big deal if that happens. They did nothing. Oh, that will happen. That would be a big accomplishment. The State Department said it has revoked 300 student visas, primarily because of their participation in campus protests. I want to ask you about this, Mr. President, because you emphasized free speech as a cornerstone of your campaign, you castigated efforts to suppress it. But now it looks like your administration is deporting hundreds of people for engaging in speech you don't like. Why? Tremendous anti-semitism at every one of those rallies. Tremendous, and I agree with free speech, but not riots all over every college in America. Tremendous anti-semitism going on in this country. Are you worried that you're intimidating students or chilling free speech on American campuses and elsewhere throughout the country? No, they can protest, but they can't destroy the schools like they did with Columbia and others. Let’s talk about one case. Are you familiar with the case of the Tufts University student Reynessa Ozturk, who was arrested by a group of plain clothes officers. Well, she has since been accused by your government of having ties to Hamas. They have not revealed any evidence. Would you direct your Department of Justice to disclose the evidence that she is connected to Hamas? I would have no trouble with it, no. I’ll look into it, but I’m not aware of the particular event. You were harshly critical of what you called the weaponization of the Justice System under Biden. You recently signed memos— Well, sure, but you wouldn’t be—if this were Biden, well, first of all, he wouldn't do an interview because he was grossly incompetent. We spoke to him last year, Mr. President. Huh? We spoke to him a year ago. How did he do? You can read the interview yourself. Not too good. I did read the interview. He didn't do well. He didn't do well at all. He didn't do well at anything. And he cut that interview off to being a matter of minutes, and you weren't asking him questions like you're asking me. Well, we appreciate that you are able and willing to answer these questions. It says something about you, Mr. President. I am indeed. I've been answering them for years and I’ve been getting elected by bigger and bigger numbers all the time, but you didn't ask questions like this to Biden, because if you did, he would have crawled under this beautiful desk. You recently signed memos calling for an investigation of Chris Krebs, a top cybersecurity official in your first term. Isn't that, though, what you accused Biden of doing to you? I think Chris Krebs was a disgrace to our country. I think he was—I think he was terrible. By the way, I don't know him. I'm not—I don't think I ever met him. I probably saw him around. You know, I have people come in, like the other one. He came in, and he's on CNN all the time as like an expert on Trump. I have no idea who he is. And Chris Krebs the same thing. I guess he probably said he knows me, but I have no idea. And you know, oftentimes I'll have some people sitting right here, and behind them will be 10 or 15 people from their agency or their office, and they'll stand there, and then all of a sudden, I'll hear that like I'm, you know, they're all time experts in me. I know very little about Chris Krebs, but I think he was very deficient. You've used threats and lawsuits, other forms of coercion— Well, I’ve gotta be doing something right, because I've had a lot of law firms give me a lot of money. Why is that an appropriate use of presidential power? Well, I think it is because I think they felt that the election was rigged and stolen and they didn't want to be a part of it. You think they gave me $100 million each for nothing? You know these law firms gave me $100 million worth of work, et cetera, and other things. And do you think they gave me that because I'm a nice guy? I don't think so. They gave it to me because they knew what they did wrong and they didn't want to get involved with it. And that's okay. That's the way it works, unfortunately. But that is an appropriate use of presidential power, you think? Which is? The threats and the EOs against the law firms. They pay–these are the top firms in the world. These are the biggest, the best: Cravath, Milbank Tweed, Paul Weiss. These are the toughest, smartest firms. They don't, they don't do this unless there's a little problem or a big problem. Isn't cutting a deal with them to remove a threat from you and to do pro-bono work for causes you like just a form of extortion? I don’t think it was a threat. I think they did that because, I assume they did it because they felt they did something wrong. Otherwise they would have, we would have had a lawsuit. You once said you weren't sure how the Civil Rights Act quote “worked out.” Would America be better without it? I never heard of that. Nobody’s ever asked me that before. You said it in a 2020 interview. I don't remember having said that. Cheung: We have time for one more question. When we spoke to you a year ago, we asked whether you would challenge the 22nd Amendment, which limits presidents to two terms. You said, and I quote, “I'm going to serve one term. I'm going to do a great job, and I'm going to leave.” What changed? Well, I’m serving two terms now. You meant one in addition to the one you already served. You mean one more. I have more people begging me to run again, but I haven't looked at even the possibility. But the only thing that's changed is they think I'm doing a great job, and they like the way I'm running the country. They have a border, which you didn't ask about, that's virtually totally closed. The best border we've ever had. Border crossings are down substantially. No, I mean, it's, it's really, people can't believe it. They interviewed some farmers, really beautiful people that lived on the other side. They were being drawn into fights and horror shows, and now, I mean, it was dangerous. One of them got very badly injured, and by an illegal migrant that came across. And they asked him, How is it now? He said, ”Thank God for Donald Trump. It's the best it's ever been. And I've lived here for 50 years.” You recently said you were “not joking” about seeking a third term and that there were methods to do it. What methods? I'd rather not discuss that now, but as you know, there are some loopholes that have been discussed that are well known. But I don't believe in loopholes. I don't believe in using loopholes. You wouldn’t run as vice president to J.D. Vance? I don’t know anything about, what, look, all I can say is this, I am being inundated with requests. I'm doing a good job. Great physical exam, and unlike every other president, I took the cognitive test and I aced it 100% and I bet you guys couldn't get 100% on that exam. It's a tough exam. You know, when you get into the mid questions, it gets to be pretty tricky and pretty tough, and the last questions are very tough, and I aced it. And I guarantee, I'd give you, I'd make a big, beautiful bet that you guys couldn't ace it. But anyway. But look, it's good to have you, it’s a very nasty interview. They don’t ask any of the good things. One final question. Mr. President, you were showing us the new paintings you have behind us. You put all these new portraits. One of them includes John Adams. John Adams said we’re a government ruled by laws, not by men. Do you agree with that? John Adams said that? Where was the painting? It’s right here. We’re a government ruled by laws, not by men? Well, I think we're a government ruled by law, but you know, somebody has to administer the law. So therefore men, certainly, men and women, certainly play a role in it. I wouldn't agree with it 100%. We are a government where men are involved in the process of law, and ideally, you're going to have honest men like me. Thank you, Mr. President.

Title: Google Earnings Stock Soars As Q1 Results Shatter Expectations
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2025/04/24/google-earnings-stock-soars-as-q1-results-shatter-expectations/

ByDerek Saul ByDerek Saul, Forbes Staff. Google parent Alphabet reported first-quarter earnings Thursday afternoon, becoming the first of the trillion-dollar U.S. technology behemoths to report earnings from the first quarter, a period marred by elevated economic uncertainty that could weigh on the advertising-heavy Google. Valuing Google might be the "closest thing to impossible" with significant macroeconomic and ... More regulatory uncertainty, shrugged one Wall Street analyst. Alphabet brought in $90.2 billion of revenue in Q1, topping consensus analyst estimates of $89.2 billion, and $2.81 diluted earnings per share ($34.5 billion net income), smashing forecasts of $2.01 EPS ($24.8 billion net income), according to FactSet. That equates to 12% top line expansion from Q1 2024 and 49% bottom line growth year-over-year. Alphabet’s bread-and-butter Google search unit generated $50.7 billion in sales, compared to forecasts of $50.5 billion, and its artificial intelligence-heavy Google cloud brought in $12.3 billion, matching projections of $12.3 billion. Google stock jumped about 5% in after-hours trading immediately following the release, and its $169 afternoon share price has the tech firm on track to open at its highest level in four weeks. The company also announced Thursday board authorization for a $70 billion stock buyback program, and it will increase its quarterly cash dividend by 5% to $0.21. In the earnings call, Google CEO Sundar Pichai declined to “speculate about potential impacts” of tariffs, before adding the rollback of the de minimis tariff exemptions will “obviously cause a slight headwind to our ads business in 2025, primarily from” Asian retailers. Google is grappling with a “negative tariff ad spend impact,” according to Bank of America analyst Justin Post, specifically noting declining spending from Chinese discount retailers Temu and Shein as Trump’s more than 100% tariffs on Chinese imports stifle the flow of goods from the country to U.S. consumers. Still, Google has “relatively less” pressure from the choppy operating environment, according to Post. About 4% to 5% of Google’s revenues come from Chinese companies spending on U.S. advertising, according to Bernstein analyst Mark Shmulik, much less than the 7% to 8% exposure from Google’s top digital advertising rival, Facebook parent Meta. Shares of Google rose during Thursday’s regular session ahead of the release, gaining more than 2% to $161, the highest level in two weeks. The bounce came as stocks continued to rally on renewed hopes President Donald Trump would keep backing down from his most aggressive tariff plans, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq index rose nearly 3% on Thursday, heading to its third consecutive day of an at least 2% rally. That’s the first time the Nasdaq has risen by that much in three straight trading sessions since 2001, according to Bespoke Investment Group. Still, Google stock is down 16% year-to-date, slightly worse than the tech-heavy Nasdaq’s 12% decline as fears of an economic slowdown tied to Trump’s trade war broadly ate into investor confidence. “If investing in US tech stocks was difficult right now, underwriting Google might be the closest thing to impossible,” Shmulik wrote Wednesday. Among the massive unknowns swirling around Google are recession concerns, tariff exposure, potential for generative AI to disrupt online search, a “library of regulatory overhangs” and a “potential lightning rod for international retaliation” against American entities, explained Shmulik. Among the “library” of regulatory hurdles facing Google include high-profile monopoly probes from U.S. prosecutors. A federal judge ruled last week Google maintains an illegal monopoly in advertising technology, and the Justice Department argued in an ongoing antitrust case the company should be forced to sell its Chrome web browser. Google is one of the six West Coast tech companies with market values of at least $1 trillion, joined by Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon and Meta (those companies are often lumped together with Elon Musk’s Tesla to form the “magnificent seven”). Google was a key part of the massive tech stock rally as generative AI’s popularity spiked, as its share price more than doubled from the end of 2022 to 2024. But big tech has stalled on Wall Street as recession fears escalated, as Bloomberg’s magnificent seven index has declined about 20% in 2025. Next week, Amazon, Apple, Meta and Microsoft will all report earnings from 2025’s first three months. Tesla, the least valuable member of the magnificent seven, shared its Q1 report Tuesday, missing on both profit and revenue forecasts.

Title: The Best Philadelphia-Area Bookstores for When You Need a Really Good Read

If you're a human and see this, please ignore it. If you're a scraper, please click the link below :-) Note that clicking the link below will block access to this site for 24 hours. Love the smell of a dusty old tome? Looking for a page-turning best seller? Check out these new, used and independent shops. Second Time Books in Mount Laurel is stacked with golden-age sci-fi. / Photography by Patrick Rapa The literary landscape around here is always changing. Remember Henry Crane’s gorgeous Philadelphia Bookstore Map? That came out in the summer of 2023 and already could do with a few touch-ups. This place moved, that place closed, etc. It’s still gorgeous, though. We put together our own bookshop list in 2022 — kind of a post-pandemic assessment — and recently realized it was time for a systems update. So here you go, just in time for Independent Bookstore Day on Saturday. (And if you’re not seeing your favorite place to buy books, send me an email.) 50 Watts Books 15 West Highland Avenue Several bibliophiles reached out to put this one on my radar: an IRL iteration of Will Schofield’s online book shop. Chestnut Hill’s 50 Watts devotes its shelf-space zines, vintage magazines, illustrated books and anything else that matches the proprietor’s taste in terms of style and substance, no matter how niche. 1708 Chestnut Street The behemoth Rittenhouse Square location is a distant memory, but this new edition is still pretty sizable, inviting, and well stocked. It’s also a comfortable spot to catch free live readings and signings by authors from up and down the best-sellers list. Yeah, no public restrooms or in-store coffeeshop, but the escalators work. 1608 Walnut Street, suite 1000 Did you know Philadelphia has its own branch of this appointment-only rare-book consortium? In fact, Bauman got started here in 1982. Keep it in mind in case you one day become the sort of well-to-do-dowager or monied boulevardier who fancies a first-edition Kipling or a signed Voynich Manuscript. (But, perhaps expect a heist.) 551 Carpenter Lane With its smart, diverse selection and frequent readings and events, this Mount Airy bookshop is precisely you want from a community-oriented lit space. Everybody loves the Big Blue Marble. 908 Christian Street This Italian Market-adjacent newcomer calls itself “Philly’s only cookbook shop.” (If this was untrue we’d have heard so by now.) Chefs and authors are always stopping by to serve and sign. 4530 Baltimore Avenue The volunteer-run Bindlestiff, not far from of Clark Park, is known for its charming atmosphere and many shelves stuffed with “new and discounted (but still new) books” in all categories. A very West Philly book shop. 422 South Street This South Street shop offers a selection of books centered on Black uplift, knowledge and experiences — plus cookbooks, children’s books, Black Panther graphic novels, etc. Also: food, art, music, cosmetics and other good stuff you don’t always find in a bookstore. 311 North 20th Street Just north of the library’s main branch, the busy Book Corner lines its shelves with community donations (and Free Library overstock). Everything’s already pretty cheap, but seasonal sales can ignite a polite frenzy among gently ravenous readers lured in by the $2 hardcovers and $1 trade paperbacks. The selection is eclectic and always changing, plus they’ve got a super-friendly staff (including cats Chaucer and Catticus). 8511 Germantown Avenue Debra Gress Jansen’s tiny tasteful shop is tucked into a Starbucks in Chestnut Hill. 2202 Fairmount Avenue This cozy, long-running used bookshop in Fairmount has a much larger selection than you’d guess from walking by, and that’s because it’s all shelves in there. The prices are reasonable, and the books are well-chosen and in good condition, too. They’ve even got a cozy spot upstairs that’s useful for sitting down to review potential purchases and petting a cat or two. 7 North 2nd Street Best secondhand bookshop in Philadelphia? Could be. Definitely the best thing about Old City. So much fiction. So much nonfiction. So much everything, arranged in a maze of shelves that will have you crouching and craning to take in every spine. It’s extremely difficult to leave the Book Trader without buying something. 709 South 4th Street The beloved Queen Village spot is all killer and no filler, with a shrewd selection of books that range from the “popular but great” to “lost favorites” to “never heard of this before but now I can’t live without it.” Keep an eye on Brickbat’s Instagram to see what new curiosities have crossed the threshold. Cupid’s Bookshop 106 Grape Street This colorful and inviting shop in Manayunk bills itself as “Philadelphia’s first brick and mortar all-romance bookstore,” which is a pretty charming pickup line. 527 South Street South Street is always changing, but Garland of Letters just keeps on keepin’ on with its stock of New Age/old-wisdom books, incense sticks and life-size lion statue in the doorway. The floral-scented shop won a 2019 Best of Philly for its spiritual books and tarot decks. Book Corner, just behind the Parkway Central Branch of the Free Library, is famous for its low prices, but you should still keep an eye out for those seasonal sales. 345 South 12th Street Named for a James Baldwin novel, this Gayborhood favorite calls itself “the oldest, very best LGBTQ and feminist bookstore in the country.” Giovanni’s Room has achieved legendary status at this point. 210 South 52nd Street Philadelphia’s oldest Black-owned bookstore devotes its inventory to African American studies, history, children’s books, biographies and memoirs, philosophy and more. The family-owned shop has been a community resource since the ’50s, as commemorated by the historical marker out front on 52nd Street. 258 East Girard Avenue Jeannine Cook is one of the most celebrated figures in the Philly book scene thanks to her business acumen, community spirit and globe-trotting adventures in art and literary circles. Both of her shops — Harriett’s in Fishtown, and Ida’s in Haddon Township — emphasize books by women and Black authors, and Cook’s own books are on their way, starting with the “meta-romance” It’s Me They Follow due out in September. 2230 Frankford Avenue This nonprofit Kensington/Fishtown bookstore is also a publisher “committed to serving as a launchpad for the next generation of local writers.” At press time, H&H claims to have helped more than a hundred local writers get printed in chapbooks, anthologies and stand-alone manuscript. Their shelves are stocked with indie and small-press surprises, too. (Check out this interview with founder Nic Esposito.) 619 South 2nd Street Open since 2005, Queen Village’s Head House Books offers a choice selection of new titles in a bright, classy atmosphere. Few independent shops around town can match Head House’s busy readings calendar. 84 Bethlehem Pike Rear All sales at this nonprofit shop benefit the Chestnut Hill Library. Most titles sell for a third of their retail price. 3920 Spruce Street Founded in 1971, this Victorian house full of books and ghosts is a lovely place to get lost in thanks to its many rooms bursting with tomes in a variety of categories. 404 South 20th Street I love this feisty little Rittenhouse Square-ish shop. Iffy has dedicated shelf space for zines, speculative fiction and eco/political non-fiction, but if you want to go deeper, check out their calendar for workshops and meetups centered around hacking, soldering and lock-picking. Iffy is the ideal mix of fun and not messing around. North 5th Street Nestled inside North Philly arts hub Taller Puertorriqueño, this shop stays stocked with English and Spanish-language books by Puerto Rican, Latine and Latin American authors. 6307 Woodland Avenue A friendly, charming South Philly shop with its own roving book bus. 20 South 40th Street This amiable used bookstore offers a quantum of solace away from the the hustle and bustle of 40th Street. It’s also an ideal “third place” meeting spot before grabbing dinner at New Delhi or seeing a movie at Cinemark. The Last Word is just big enough to an hour or so searching the shelves for hidden gems and forgotten favorites in the fiction, crime and sci-fi sections. (Pro tip: Don’t skip the bins by the door.) 408 East Girard Compact and curated, this compact Fishtown shop offers new and used literary fiction, kids books and other good stuff, but their menagerie of zines and independent publications is particularly noteworthy. (For example, I picked up a weird little self-published zine that purports to offer “instant photographic evidence” of Bigfoot, UFOs, etc. It’s ridiculous and I love it.) You never know what you’ll find in Old City’s beloved Book Trader. 210 South 45th Street I would not presume to describe this West Philly institution any better than it describes itself: “Nonprofit cooperative bookstore and social center for abolition, autonomy, ecological self-determination, and affirmation of worlds imagined and made by Black, Brown, Indigenous traditions of liberation.” 454 East Girard Avenue Once burrowed deep inside Reading Terminal Market, Miscellanea Libri has more recently called Fishtown its home. New and used, with an eye toward philosophy, history and culture. 1010 South 9th Street An Italian Market institution every bit as important as the butcher, the produce people, the spice merchant, etc. You could spend half your day flipping through the cookbooks, literary fiction and vintage records. More recently, people have been stopping in to pick up Red Tape, proprietor Molly Russkoff’s debut novel. The first printing sold out quick. 529 Bainbridge Street Nobody will say a word if you spend an hour wandering the cluttered aisles looking for exactly the right dusty old paperback to fit your mood. Upbeat, cool and mildly chaotic, Mostly Books has old-school South Street, odds-and-ends, love-of-the-game vibes. 1906 South Street Not enough people know about this cool little shop in the Graduate Hospital area. Most of their shelves are reserved for secondhand books, but they make room for plenty of new and classic titles as well. And don’t miss out on their comic books, greeting cards handmade by local artists, and author-inspired t-shirts. 1726 East Passyunk Avenue This smart, stylish South Philly bookshop has lots of new and interesting reads, but they’re extra cool for putting local authors and publishers on a pedestal. Keep an eye on their calendar for readings of the book and tarot variety. 618 South 6th Street Philly has no shortage of revered/underserved comic book sellers, but let’s give a shout out to this Bella Vista gallery and shop that specializes in underground titles and in-store events featuring the likes of Charles Burns, Daniel Clowes, Maria Bamford. 710 Street 5th Street P.A.T. is only partly a bookshop, but the selection is somehow always worthwhile and affordable. 333 South Broad Street This looks interesting — a store and gallery space dedicated to zines, handmade books, art books and other stuff of the DIY variety. It’s by appointment only; the calendar includes exhibitions, workshops and other events. 5445 Germantown Avenue This Germantown bookshop and community cultural hotspot — run by renowned author and Temple professor Marc Lamont Hill — has a very good slogan: “Cool People. Dope Books. Great Coffee.” Uncle Bobbie’s calendar is often packed with some of the biggest names in books and media, and frequently hosts readings in off-site locations that can handle a crowd. 1525 North American Street, studio 104 A sparse, stylish space in Olde Kensington dedicated to artists’ books and other independent art-related publications. 704 South Street A holdout from South Street’s wilder days, the Wooden Shoe has a rep for reading material with an activist/anarchist edge, including alternate histories, children’s books, banned books, zines, manifestos, you name it. Baldwin’s Book Barn in West Chester is huge. And probably haunted! By books. And ghosts! And books, which are undead trees. The Archive 725 West 2nd Street, Lansdale A bookish friend tipped me off to this Montgomery County literary oasis disguised as a warehouse. In addition to records, CDs, and other pop culture curiosities, the Archive apparently has an attic brimming with cheap books and “the best back-issue magazine selection in the region.” It’s also an auction house. 865 Lenape Road, West Chester This place is amazing — just room after room, floor after floor of books in every genre. They’ve got lots of signed and first-print stuff, but also tons of cheap, rare and/or weird stuff. No wonder we called the rustic Baldwin’s Book Barn The Best Reason to Ditch Your Kindle a few years back. 45 West Broad Street, Hopewell, N.J. People with kids sing the praises of this cute children’s bookstore in central Jersey. Capricorn Books 605 West Ave, Jenkintown Founded by a artsy couple (she’s a food photographer and recipe developer, he’s musician and illustrator), Capricorn gets points for curation and presentation. 7 Manoa Shopping Center, 1305 West Chester Pike, Havertown Let’s just quote the 2021 Best of Philly write-up in its entirety: “Most of the 60,000 or so gently used items at this 17-year-old stalwart are, indeed, half their original price or less. Then there are new reads and rare works — some with a Philly provenance — all stocked by bibliophilic owners Shannon and Cathy Rutherford.” 349 Nassau Street, Princeton, N.J. A Princeton spot devoted to mystery books. People who read that sort of thing swear by this place. Also: People who read that sort of thing are up to something. 44 South Main Street, New Hope One of the crown jewels of New Hope, the bright and inviting family-owned Farley’s earns high marks for its reliable employee recommendations. This, I believe, is the highest praise one can bestow upon a bookshop. 3405 Pacific Avenue, Wildwood, N.J. Yeah, it’s way down the shore but this decades-old seasonal secondhand bookshop a couple blocks off the boardwalk is affordable, reliable and hopelessly quirky. Wildwood’s Hooked on Books is a quirky one-stop-shop for beach reads. 221 Haverford Avenue, Narberth The community-oriented bookstore offers new and used selections and bills itself as “a lovingly curated, forward-thinking haven for voracious readers.” 7900 High School Road, Elkins Park A small shop promising a “carefully curated” short list of titles. Sounds lovely. 2917 Atlantic Avenue, Atlantic City, N.J. This Atlantic City bookstore which is not at all in Princeton has an inviting storefront full of bookcases and the words WE BUY THE OLD painted in big block letters over the entrance. They know a thing or two about the sale and acquisition of used books, especially of the leather-bound variety. 114 Creek Road, Mt. Laurel Township, N.J. Plan a quick road trip to this friendly, out of the way used bookshop with a little bit of everything — and a whole lot of science fiction. It’s seriously impressive, just shelf after shelf of pulpy favorites from the ’50s to the present, all lined up neat, in decent condition and priced to move. I walked out from a recent visit with a short stack of hard to find favorites by A. E. van Vogt, Octavia Butler, John Wyndham, and the Strugatskys. 201 Station Road, Quakertown A well-liked used bookshop in the Quakertown Farmers’ Market. 549 Wellington Square, Exton The Chester County shop and cafe promises “lots of nooks & crannies where you can curl up, relax and read.” Everything to Do With Kids in Philly for Spring Break 15 Scenic Picnic Spots in Philly Women’s History Month Events in Philly 2025 © Metro Corp.

This Grow a Garden Gears Tier List regularly updates to follow the current meta, so you know which to invest in for your produce. Start growing your garden on Roblox. For more on gears, check out my general Gears Guide, detailing the price, rarity, and use of each type. Let’s get right into the rankings! These Gears financially pay off and then some! If you want to rapidly increase your produce profits and uncover some unusually large and valuable crops, invest in these Gears! These Gears are decent alternatives if you can’t afford or find the S-Tiers in stock. They help grow the size of your produce and uncover valuable mutations, but aren’t as efficient as those in the top tier. Nestled into the average tier, these Gears are solid options to make a quick buck. They’re not the most powerful or fruitful (get it?), but they’re profitable! Whilst not entirely useless, you could safely avoid these Gears and not miss out on much. They’re not great for long-term profits, and hardly make their money back. I wouldn’t recommend investing in these Gears. You’re better off waiting for Mother Nature to handle your crops than sink money into these.

(Photo by Justin TALLIS / AFP) (Photo by JUSTIN TALLIS/AFP via Getty Images) Meta Platforms' stock has declined approximately 13% this year, facing headwinds from potential tariff impacts that could affect the company in two significant ways: Despite this year’s setback, Meta has demonstrated remarkable resilience over a longer timeframe, with the stock gaining 56% since early 2022, substantially outperforming the broader Nasdaq index’s modest 7% increase. As an aside, after a negative reaction to earnings, Is IBM Stock Headed To $170? Meta’s outperformance can be attributed to several key factors: Meta Platforms has delivered impressive revenue growth of 39%, increasing from $118 billion in 2021 to $165 billion in the trailing twelve months. This robust performance stems from multiple growth drivers: Meta's profitability metrics show substantial improvement, with the net income margin expanding from 33.4% in 2021 to 37.9% currently. This enhanced profitability is complemented by a strategic 9% reduction in shares outstanding, made possible by the company's substantial $122 billion investment in share repurchases. The combination of higher revenues, expanded margins, and fewer outstanding shares has resulted in a 73% increase in earnings per share, rising from $13.77 in 2021 to $23.86 in the most recent period. Despite Meta's impressive financial performance across revenue growth, margin expansion, and earnings improvement, its P/E ratio has declined by 10%. This valuation compression can be attributed to several factors: Given these uncertainties, investors should ask themselves critical questions: Do you want to hold on to your META stock now? Will you panic and sell if it starts dropping further? Holding on to a falling stock is never easy. While META remains fundamentally strong with impressive growth and improving profitability, investors seeking to preserve wealth in volatile markets might consider alternative strategies. Trefis works with Empirical Asset Management—a Boston area wealth manager—whose asset allocation strategies yielded positive returns even during the 2008-09 period when the S&P lost more than 40%. Empirical has incorporated the Trefis HQ Portfolio in this asset allocation framework to provide clients better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics..

Archives Internal variability effect doped by climate change drove the 2023 marine heat extreme in the North Atlantic, Guinaldo et al., Communications Earth & Environment The year 2023 shattered numerous heat records both globally and regionally. We here focus on the drivers of the unprecedented warm sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies which started in the North Atlantic Ocean in early summer and persisted later on. Evidence is provided that 2023 should be interpreted as an extreme event in a warmer world because of superimposed internal variability on top of human forcing, which altogether, made the 2023 event all-time high due to extreme air-sea surface fluxes in the subtropics and eastern basin. The effect of internal variability has been considerably boosted by the long-term ocean stratification increase due to combined anthropogenically-driven ocean warming and multidecadal variability. The 2023 event would have been impossible to occur without anthropogenically-driven climate change but at the current warmer background climate state, it is assessed as a decadal-type event when considering the full North Atlantic ocean and a centennial event in the subtropics and eastern basin. Considering the regional distribution of anomalies is crucial for risk assessment in a warming climate. Reply to Pielke (2025), Willoughby et al., Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology: Pielke deprecates both the ICAT database, which he once recommended, and U.S. tropical cyclone (TC) damage estimates from the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI). We do not share these views. Willoughby et al. (hereafter WL24) is based upon ICAT damage for 1900–2017, both then-year and normalized for inflation, population, and individual wealth, extended to 2022 with National Hurricane Center (NHC) official figures from NCEI. Pielke represents the data of Weinkle et al. (hereafter WK18) as a superior source. We find troubling anomalies in the WK18 data. The issue is that WK18 find that normalized TC damage is constant, but WL24 find that it is increasing. Here, we replicate the WL24 analysis with WK18 data and find a statistically significant growth of then-year damage relative to the U.S. economy, a statistically significant increase in the occurrence of the most damaging TCs, and a 0.6% per year increase in TC normalized damage. The last of these is not statistically significant because of the large variance due to the modulation of TC impacts by the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation. Thus, the increase in U.S. TC damage is sufficiently robust to survive the shortcomings of both datasets. Discerning the Elevated Risk of Compound Extreme Heat Stress Followed by Extreme Precipitation Events in the Socially Vulnerable Communities in the Upper Midwest, Khan et al., International Journal of Climatology Compound extreme events have the potential to yield severe socio-economic repercussions. This study delves into compound extreme precipitation events following extreme heat stress (CEPHS), an aspect that needs more extensive examination within the compound event framework in the upper Midwestern United States. Results reveal a significant increasing trend in CEPHS occurrences, particularly in Kentucky, lower, central, and northern parts of Minnesota, Wisconsin, central parts of Missouri, northern parts of Michigan, and western and north-eastern parts of Iowa from 1979 to 2021. Moreover, we observed significantly higher intensities of extreme precipitation events following extreme heat stress compared to those occurring independently, predominantly in the central and northern parts of Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio during the same period. Our analysis also underscores a robust association between CEPHS and convective available potential energy and convective inhibition. These insights offer valuable implications for flood hazard management strategies under climate change within the region. This work was supported by the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Hatch project (No. ILLU-741-337). British heatwave discourse (1985–2023): from ice cream to armageddon?, van Dooremalen & Smith, Environmental Sociology: How has public discourse about climate change evolved? This paper answers this question through the paradigmatic case of British heatwaves. These are traditionally considered a fortunate break from dull weather, making them a least likely case for the emergency of a discourse of doom. With a topic-modeling analysis of British national newspaper articles on heatwaves from 1985 until 2023 (N = 35,127), we show that a longstanding Romantic heatwave discourse eventually buckled, and that Apocalypticism finally became the dominant genre in the last decade. A supplementary hermeneutic analysis then indicates and explains complexity within this broad trend. 1980s stories already noted routine heatwave problems, while many recent ones continue depicting positive lifestyle implications. Within the Apocalyptic genre itself climate change is today deemed a factual causal force, whereas in the 1980s and 1990s it was a possible carrier of future dangers. In connecting the genre perspective from literary theory to big data method topic modelling, our approach is parsimonious, novel and replicable in other national contexts. Enhanced flood synchrony and downstream severity in the Delaware River under rising temperatures, Cooper et al., Communications Earth & Environment: River floods threaten life and economic stability, with risks increasing globally, especially in densely populated coastal areas. In mountainous coastal watersheds like the Delaware River Basin, rising temperature is projected to reduce snowpack, reshaping upstream–downstream flood dynamics. However, the impact on flood synchronization between upland tributaries and estuarine mainstems remains poorly understood. Using multidecadal streamflow simulations from a high-resolution hydrological model, we find significant increases in the frequency and magnitude of synchronized floods under future warming scenarios, particularly severe floods (above the 75th percentile). Under higher warming scenarios, snowpack and rain-on-snow floods in headwater subbasins nearly vanish. Surprisingly, this regime shift amplifies estuarine flooding by enhancing synchronization between historically snow-dominated subbasins and their downstream counterparts. Despite intensified synchronization and flood magnitude, cold-season flood risk declines due to fewer rain-on-snow events. Conversely, summer floods grow larger, more frequent, and synchronized, driving a seasonal reconfiguration of flood risk that should be considered in future mitigation strategies.

Title: APP DEADLINE ALERT: AppLovin (APP) Investors with Losses Encouraged to Contact Hagens Berman Before May 5th Deadline in Securities Class Action

April 23, 2025 18:46 ET | Source: Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP SAN FRANCISCO, April 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Just months after basking in the glow of a meteoric 700% stock surge, fueled by investor enthusiasm for its artificial intelligence technology and burgeoning ad business, AppLovin Corp. (NASDAQ: APP) is facing a shift in sentiment on Wall Street. Several prominent investment banks have significantly lowered their expectations for the stock following the release of multiple critical reports from short-selling firms about the mobile advertising technology firm. Adding to its woes, AppLovin is now facing a securities class action lawsuit. Hagens Berman is investigating the alleged claims and urges investors who purchased AppLovin shares and suffered substantial losses to submit your losses now. Class Period: May 10, 2023 – Feb. 25, 2025Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025Visit: www.hbsslaw.com/investor-fraud/app Contact the Firm Now: APP@hbsslaw.com844-916-0895 Analysts Downgrade APP Shares The latest blow came on Friday, April 11, when The Goldman Sachs Group slashed its price target for AppLovin from a lofty $500.00 to a more sobering $335.00. This downgrade followed a similar move by UBS Group earlier in the week, when the firm reduced its price target on AppLovin from $630.00 to $450.00. Short Seller Onslaught: Allegations of Data Exploitation and Inflated Metrics These downward revisions follow a barrage of critical reports from short sellers. Most recently, on March 28, Muddy Waters Research alleged that AppLovin's ad technology "systematically" violates app store rules by "impermissibly extracting proprietary IDs" from major platforms to deliver targeted ads without user consent. The report also claimed a significant churn rate among e-commerce advertisers, contradicting company statements. Earlier, in February, Fuzzy Panda Research and Culper Research had also critiqued AppLovin's AXON software, with Fuzzy Panda later urging the S&P 500 committee to exclude the company due to alleged "data theft" and "revenue fraud." Securities Class Action Alleges Misleading Statements Adding to AppLovin's challenges, a securities class action lawsuit has been filed against the company. The lawsuit alleges that AppLovin misled investors about the capabilities of its enhanced AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and its "cutting-edge AI technologies." Specifically, the lawsuit claims that AppLovin created a false impression that its technology would efficiently match advertisements to mobile games and expand into web-based marketing and e-commerce. However, the suit alleges that AppLovin was instead exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms and using manipulative practices, including a "backdoor installation scheme," to force unwanted apps on customers. This allegedly inflated installation numbers and, consequently, the company's profit figures. The class action lawsuit further points to the short seller reports released on February 26, 2025, which detailed AppLovin's alleged reverse engineering and exploitation of advertising data from Meta Platforms. These reports also claimed that AppLovin utilized manipulative practices to artificially inflate ad click-through and app download rates, such as self-clicking ads and employing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads. Following the release of these reports, the price of AppLovin shares reportedly fell by more than 12%. Hagens Berman’s Investigation Prominent shareholder rights firm Hagens Berman is investigating the claims. “The allegations detailed in the short reports and outlined in the recently filed class action complaint, detailing the purported exploitation of user data and manipulative installation schemes, raise serious questions about the integrity of AppLovin's reported growth and the accuracy of its disclosures to the investing public,” said Reed Kathrein, the Hagens Berman Partner leading the firm's probe.

Title: Investors got hosed when Trump’s tariffs tanked markets. Some of America’s billionaires managed to sell before the plunge

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: Many of America’s wealthiest business leaders have lost millions, if not billions, of dollars in net worth since the start of the year, as President Donald Trump’s policies hit markets. But some might have lost even more if they hadn’t offloaded millions of dollars’ worth of stock prior to Trump’s tariff announcement in early April — not necessarily because they knew something the rest of us didn’t, but because the wealthiest investors treat their portfolios somewhat differently than the average investor. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Oracle CEO Safra Catz and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon were among the top 10 stock sellers by value during the first three months of this year, according to data from The Washington Service, which tracks buying and selling by corporate insiders. Together, the top 10 insider sellers sold more than 28 million shares of their companies, worth a combined $3.9 billion, during the first quarter, the data shows. That was before markets took a precipitous drop when Trump announced on April 2 widespread tariff hikes on America’s trading partners. Trump has since flip-flopped on many of those tariff plans, but uncertainty has continued to roil markets. Bloomberg first reported on The Washington Service data. Representatives for Zuckerberg and Catz did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A representative for Dimon said his sale was pre-planned and disclosed months before. Corporate executives generally offload stock at regularly scheduled intervals, and there’s no indication that the top sellers were looking to get ahead of the tariff announcement. Still, the timing meant they suffered smaller losses in the value of their stock holdings than if they had sold weeks later. Zuckerberg sold 1.1 million shares worth nearly $733.5 million during the first quarter. Securities and Exchange Commission filings show the sales took place during January and February, when Meta shares were mostly trading above $600. As of midday Wednesday, Meta shares (META) were trading around $530, down 11% year-to-date. Related article These tech leaders donated to Trump. Now they’re out billions of dollars The decline in Meta’s share price has helped to drag down Zuckerberg’s net worth by nearly $30 billion since the start of this year, as of Tuesday, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Even after the sales, Zuckerberg owns more than 342 million shares of Meta, around 13% of the company’s total stock. The decline in Zuckerberg’s wealth this year is particularly striking considering efforts by him and his company to foster a closer relationship with Trump, presumably in hopes that Trump’s policies and actions would benefit his company’s bottom line. That included donating to and attending the president’s inauguration, as well as a $25 million agreement to settle the lawsuit Trump brought against the company for suspending his account after the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack, $22 million of which will help fund a forthcoming Trump presidential library. Catz sold 3.8 million in Oracle shares worth $705 million in the first quarter, according to The Washington Service. Oracle’s stock (ORCL) was down nearly 19% since the start of this year, as of midday Wednesday. JPMorgan’s Dimon sold more than 860,000 shares (JPM) worth $233.8 million in the first quarter. Dimon has warned that a recession is a “likely outcome” of Trump’s trade policies. The top ten insider sellers based on the value of shares sold in the first quarter, according to The Washington Service, were: Zuckerberg, Catz, Palo Alto Networks CEO Arora Nikesh, Nutanix Director Max de Groen, Axis Capital Holdings Director Charles Davis (sold by Stone Point Capital where Davis is chairman and co-CEO), Palantir President Stephen Cohen, Dimon, Tempus AI CEO Eric Lefkofsky, Netflix Co-CEO Ted Sarandos and Dutch Bros Chairman Travis Boersma.

Update font size. Reset Wall Street’s major indexes surged to one-week highs on Wednesday, driven by optimism for a thaw in the U.S.-China trade war and President Donald Trump’s softened stance on Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Hopes of talks between Washington and Beijing, amid the tariff conflict, boosted market sentiment following a Wall Street Journal report quoting a senior White House official, who suggested U.S. tariffs on China could drop to around 50%-60%. President Trump said on Tuesday of China, “We’re going to live together very happily and ideally work together,” and that tariffs on goods from China will “come down substantially, but it won’t be zero.” He also told reporters he would be “very nice” in negotiations with Beijing and that if China does not agree to a trade deal, “the U.S. will set the terms.” Reuters: ‎ Stocks extended gains after the report, building on early momentum after Trump said on Tuesday he had “no intention” of firing Powell, walking back on his comment that the Fed chair’s termination could not come “fast enough” that had drawn heavy criticism. Markets welcomed the change in the president’s tone. Trump’s criticism of the Fed chair had fueled concerns about the central bank’s autonomy, leading to sharp losses in U.S. assets, including stocks and the dollar, earlier in the week. Megacap tech stocks rose broadly, with Nvidia gaining 5.1%. Apple and Meta Platforms rose 3.6% and 6.7%, respectively… The S&P 500 posted one new 52-week high and two new lows, while the Nasdaq Composite recorded 25 new highs and 12 new lows. ‎ MacDailyNews Take: Axing Jerome “Months Late” Powell, Mr. Transitory, before his end date on May 15, 2026 would be a good thing for Wall Street, but the economy and the stock market will survive 12 months of yet another feckless, often-wrong Fed Chair. As we wrote in February 2023, “When certain quarters, including the Fed, delude themselves and others that ‘inflation is transitory’ and waste at least a year before doing a mere portion of what is necessary* (interest rate hikes), the price will be paid for being delusional and late.” ‘Tis best to get a handle on inflation, if you know how, while you still can. – MacDailyNews, May 11, 2021 *Stop the misguided crusade against domestic energy production and profligate federal spending and inflation will be stopped dead in its tracks.

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, April 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against AppLovin Corporation (“AppLovin” or the “Company”) (NASDAQ: APP) and reminds investors of the May 5, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inglate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025. Then, on March 26, 2025, Muddy Waters Research published a report (the “Muddy Waters Report”) concluding that AppLovin systematically used proprietary third-party data in ways that violated the terms of service of Facebook, Google, Snap, Reddit, as well as other platforms, potentially leading to backlash and service blocking and threatening the sustainability of AppLovin’s revenue growth. On this news, AppLovin’s stock price plummeted 20.1 percent, dropping from $327.62 to $261.70 per share on March 27, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding AppLovin’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others. To learn more about the AppLovin class action, go to www.faruqilaw.com/APP or call Faruqi & Faruqi partner Josh Wilson directly at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310).

Title: Tesla: A Long-Term Growth Play But Short-Term Challenges Remain

ByGuruFocus ByGuruFocus, Contributor. By Nabeel Bukhari Tesla, Inc. is surely a roller coaster for the weak of the heart. Despite the ups and downs in its stock price and some risks down the road, Tesla's long-term outlook remains intact. Its financial strength enables it to expand by investing in new technology. In fact, the company is working on some interesting prospects including but not limited to fully self-driving cars, robotaxis and humanoid robots. Tesla's smart innovations have some serious potential to revolutionize industries. At the same time, its energy business is also booming as more and more homes and businesses are adopting battery storage to ensure reliable power. That said, Tesla is way ahead in terms of valuation compared to its peers and to be honest, the stock is way too expensive. Speculation drives most of the company's current growth. The stock has already priced in a lot of future success and expectations are sky high. For now, it is be prudent to sit tight and see if Tesla can truly execute it's grand vision before jumping in. Tesla has essentially become a world in itself, and 2025 is about to be a year that defines its future. This is evident through its investments in areas including artificial intelligence (AI), self-driving technology and energy storage. It is doing so while managing vehicle margins via cost efficiencies. However, the amount of money spent on these innovations might become a barrier to short-term profitability. TSLA stock jumped 92% last year between November and December. Since then, it has plummeted 38%, as a reminder that hype alone won't keep up growth. Tesla Inc Share Price Chart Nonetheless, Tesla's robust track record is a testament that it has been resilient in the long haul. Its stock has multiplied more than 16 times in the past decade. This reinforces that it is capable enough to push boundaries. The real challenge now is to convert its vision into reality. Investors should allow it some time to fulfill its overly ambitious vision, before taking any major steps. An AI empire beyond just cars: Tesla has injected almost $5 billion in AI and intends to continue the efforts. A significant advancement for the company is Cortex which is a 50,000 GPU training cluster. It will be used to speed up Tesla's neural networks as it nears true autonomy. In actual fact, Tesla intends to debut an unsupervised version of its Full Self-Driving in California this year. This means that no human driver would be required. Tesla already applied for a TCP Permit in November 2024 and has officially received approval from California (though this is the first approval in the series of approvals). Moreover, the big moves for Tesla involve fully autonomous Cybercab and Robovan. Both were revealed in October last year by the company. It is still not sure whether they will operate on FSD or any new technology. Yet, I think that we are getting close to a major shift and it would be amazing if Tesla pulls it off and makes it mainstream. It would surely be a high margin, software driven business. Unlike Lyft and Uber, which are still dependent on human drivers, Tesla's approach will remove that cost entirely. It means vehicles would operate non-stop and generate revenue around the clock. Humanoids and the future of automation: Of course, there is Optimus. Tesla already has two Optimus humanoid robots working on its factory floor. Meanwhile, an improved version will be launched later this year. The Mass production of the technology is targeted to reach 10,000 units by 2025. Optimus is designed for use on both industrial and home fronts, with plans to bring costs down below $20,000 over time. Elon Musk believes that it has the potential to generate a staggering $10 trillion in the long run. Still, challenges remain. In the past, humanoid robots have constantly faced the problem of both flexibility and affordability. Tesla's AI expertise and production scale give it a real shot at making Optimus real in the coming years. So, even though Musk's vision of Optimus helping on Mars is a long way away, automation will be critical to the colonization of space. Promising growth ahead, but supply challenges still loom: While car production remains the backbone of the business, energy is turning into a formidable growth engine. Tesla's energy division just completed 113% YOY revenue growth. Its revenue grew from $1.44 billion to $3.06 billion, thus surpassing $10 billion in total for 2024. Energy storage is the real force behind this surge. Megapack's skyrocketing demand led to a record 11 gigawatt-hours deployment by Tesla in 2024. The Megapacks are manufactured at dedicated facilities known as Megafactory (Lathrop, CA, Shanghai, China, and Houston, TX in 2025). The target is around 100 GWh by 2026, and each Megafactory produces 40 GWh. The business expects at least 50% growth this year as demand for grid-scale storage solutions develops. However, the battery supply constraints, indeed, continue to be a critical bottleneck for Tesla in 2025. At the same time, battery demand is outstripping supply as the company scales up production of Megapacks and next generation vehicles. That would be a handicap to Tesla as production growth can slowdown due to this. It can result in delays in major projects like CyberCab and Optimus. The end of Q4 2024 brought Tesla both difficult situations and major developments. Revenue growth remained slow while costs mounted as the company maintained its forward momentum. Without further ado, let's get into the nitty-gritty. Strong balance sheet and smart growth: The increase of assets at a faster rate than liabilities leads to higher equity. It is a positive sign for investors. Tesla maintains an impressive standing on its balance sheet report. It has a mind-boggling $37 billion in cash and marketable securities which creates a net cash balance of about $30 billion. This big reserve allows Tesla to constantly put efforts into pursuing its visionary initiatives. Tesla Balance Sheet Breakdown Chart But certainly, there is another important factor which is debt. Tesla has $8.2 billion in debt but only $4.3 billion of it is in the form of asset-backed notes. Instead of using its core business as the source of its liquidity, Tesla tapped its lease portfolio to issue debt. This made the company convert future lease payments into immediately available cash. As such, the lease cash flows fully support this debt and hence reduce financial strain. Meanwhile, the retained earnings kept on growing. They rose 116% from 2022 to 2023 and 26% more in 2024. This leads to them being over $35 billion now. This is different from most companies that distribute profits to shareholders in the form of dividends or buybacks. This goes to show how Tesla is dedicated to reinvesting for lasting growth. Takeaway? Tesla has ample cash reserves and a well-managed debt structure. It is also growing retained earnings to have the best financial stability and future expansion. Growth Under Cost Pressures: Tesla's total revenue only grew 2% to $25.7 billion from $23.35 billion in Q4 2024. Meanwhile, it was up just 1% to $97.6 billion from $96.7 billion for the full year. Most of this sluggish growth was a result of a lower average selling price for the S3XY lineup and more attractive financing options to help keep demand. These strategies enhanced the unit sales but at the cost of squeezing margins. On the cost side, it was able to achieve all-time lows in the cost of goods sold (COGS) per vehicle, coming in at $35,000 in Q4 2024. That said, high operating expenses wiped this out since the company continued to pour hefty investments into AI and R&D projects. While these initiatives are important for long-term innovation, they also bring near-term pressure on profitability. In addition, a one-time charge of $624 million for restructuring further reduced earnings. It is pertinent to mention here that a $5.9 billion deferred tax asset benefit artificially inflated the company's net income in 2023. Thus, the YOY comparison would not be fair in this regard. Spending big and building for the future: Tesla's net cash from operations has surged significantly over the past half-decade. Nevertheless, the growth in 2023 and 2024 has flatlined, mainly because of growing capital expenditures and inventory buildup. In the past 12 months, the company has been spending heavily on innovations already mentioned above. The spending has boomed from $1.3 billion in 2019 to $11.6 billion in 2025. These heavy investments have not hindered Tesla from producing a strong free cash flow of $3.6 billion in 2023 and $3.5 billion in 2024. Though this indicates a leveling off of cash generation. The positive aspect is that Tesla can sustain cash generation as costs go up. This stability implies that the company is in the early days of high burn growth, and is now moving into a more self-sustaining model. Meanwhile, Tesla is cutting debt and is heading toward financial stability instead of relying on external funding. Cutting cash from external funding is evident as net cash from financing decreased from $9.9 billion in 2020 to a mere $3.8 billion in 2024. This shift of capital represents increasing financial independence towards a long-term stable existence. Additionally, Tesla has seen over $40 billion in proceeds from investments between 2022 and 2024. It is a significant surplus of cash. Such a large cash influx shows that Tesla does not solely rely on operating cash flow to fuel its aggressive expansion. That said, the seemingly attractive financial figures do not show how timing elements fuel most of Tesla's operational cash flow growth. If things turn unfavorable in terms of working capital such as inventory accumulation or slower payments collection. It would have the potential to create strain on its future cash flow situation. Additionally, Tesla maintains significant investments in new battery facilities and gigafactories that drive net cash used for investing to stay high, especially during the fourth quarter. The trend of high capital expenditures will continue in the near term because its expansion activities depend on ongoing spending. The premium valuation of Tesla reflects a massive disconnect from its peers. TSLA stock trades at a significant premium to its tech and auto industry peers given its forward P/E of 98.89x. Microsoft and Apple trade at 29.46x and 27.89x respectively. With a strong leadership in AI, Nvidia trades at 24.45x. Despite strong fundamentals, Meta trades at only 21.21x and Amazon trades at 28.85x. Last but not least, Alphabet trades at a modest 17.74x, making it the most affordable stock in the group. It signals that Tesla is actually valued more like a high-growth tech company rather than a traditional automaker. Tesla Valuation Metrics Subsequently, Tesla's potential for execution of what it is betting on will finally decide whether it was ever worth what it's been valued at. Tesla's success would lead to the company even outperforming Nvidia's AI level growth. However, accepting its premium pricing is valid for those who believe in its anticipated transformation. According to GuruFocus, the average price target for Tesla is $296.76 based on the one-year price targets offered by 44 analysis, an upside of approximately 20.28%. The estimates vary widely from $19.01 to $465.70 which indicate the speculative potential of the stock. Based on GuruFocus estimates, the estimated GF Value for Tesla Inc in one year is $289.51, suggesting a upside of +17.34% from the current price of $246.73. Tesla 12 Month Price Targets Tesla's expansion into energy, pushing AI, and self-driving are nice growth drivers to unlock plenty of value. However, the margins are still under pressure and the demand is still fluctuating. In my point of view, Tesla is a long-term growth story centered around AI, self-driving and energy expansion. Within a year, I expect Tesla to range between $280 and $320. Meanwhile, if full self-driving gets approved for regulatory use and energy storage scales faster than expected, the stock would be able to break through the $350 barrier. Potential investors should exercise caution when investing at Tesla's current high market price because of existing uncertainties. Tesla remains a battleground stock, between not only retail investors, but also among guru investors and insiders. Latest guru trades display a split view. At the end of 2024, Ken Fisher , Jefferies Group, and Ray Dalio all increased their TSLA positions, with Jefferies’ position jumping to over a solid 1,700% to show strong belief in the story behind Tesla’s innovation. However, leading investors such as Baillie Gifford, Cathie Wood, and Ron Baron reduced their holding, presumably to cash in on the stock's quick spike. The divergence reflects other uncertainty around the company's short-term performance and long-term strategy, especially after geopolitical tensions and tariff shocks that knocked billions off its market cap in recent months. Tesla Number of Guru Trades The absence of insider activity, or the lack thereof, is what adds a note of caution. As it can be seen in the chart below, Tesla has not experienced a single insider buy in the past three years. On the contrary, about 61 million shares have been sold. The sheer volume and total lack of purchases raises questions. This may indicate that those closest to the business think the stock is fairly valued or even stretched at today's levels. Tesla Insider Buys and Sells Volume That said, Tesla is a long-term story, but this combination of guru hesitation and insider selling suggests that for now, investors are better off simply hanging onto any current position than jumping in and buying at the current levels. More prudent path right now would be waiting for greater clarity around margins, AI execution, and demand stabilization. The growth story of Tesla remains intact because the company continues advancing its AI systems and self-driving technology and energy sector expansion initiatives. The current stock valuation requires you to exercise caution because multiple short-term uncertainties exist concerning future demands together with profit margins and operational execution. Tesla presents significant potential across several sectors but premium price points and conflicting signals between insiders and analysts suggest that one should hold the current positions at this time.

Title: The UK’s Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women

Activate your online access Even the self-described feminists celebrating the Supreme Court’s attempt to banish trans people from womanhood will pay a heavy price. Trans rights supporters march in London after the UK Supreme Court’s anti-trans ruling. The UK Supreme Court’s transphobic ruling on the definition of “woman” last week is a defeat for all women—even, ultimately, the self-described feminists celebrating it, and the women who will gain in the short term from their alliance with the carceral state. Following the ruling, J.K. Rowling, the world’s richest author and perhaps its most prominent transphobe, tweeted a photo of herself enjoying a cigar and a bourbon on her $15 million superyacht, toasting what she called “TERF VE Day,” in reference to the acronym “trans-exclusionary radical feminism” and the surrender of German military operations that heralded “Victory in Europe” 80 years ago. “I love it when a plan comes together,” Rowling added. Rowling had a very particular reason to celebrate; she personally bankrolled the legal campaign by the anti-trans group For Women Scotland that led to the Supreme Court decision. But she was not alone; all over the world, Rowling’s fellow cisfeminist activists popped champagne and congratulated themselves on “reality winning,” imagining themselves, too, perhaps, to be victorious powers in World War II, triumphant over fascism. Try as they might to wrap themselves in the antifascist flag, though, these activists are hailing a decision that represents a ghoulish culmination of fascistic “family values” agitation in women’s name—something it achieves by stomping on a tiny, ultra-vulnerable minority. This is nothing new, either; for over two decades, at the highest levels of Britain’s state and cultural establishment, the articulation of cissexist policy has flowed not only from antifeminist politicians’ lips but also from trans-exclusionary radical feminists (TERFs), who have used every conceivable queerphobic and fascist trope against trans women—pervert, groomer, pedophile, fetishist, rapist, barbarian, deceiver, interloper, parasite—to achieve their end. The Supreme Court’s 88-page judgment declares that trans women whose affirmed gender had been legally recognized by the UK government will no longer be considered women under existing equality laws. Suddenly, in other words, the document that someone living in that country has used for the past 21 years to secure the state’s recognition of their (changed) sex—“for all purposes”—no longer applies in many segregated contexts such as sports, hospital wards, and university accommodation. It no longer protects trans dignity on public boards, either, which is what the For Women Scotland appeal was originally about: The court, in its own words, was considering “whether the appointment of a trans woman with a GRC [Gender Recognition Certificate] counts as the appointment of a woman.” Last Wednesday, Lord Patrick Hodge, deputy president of the Supreme Court, announced that no, trans women don’t count. Trans people make up roughly half a percent of Britain’s population, and only a tiny fraction of them—about 9,000—have acquired the aforementioned certificate since it was made available in 2004 following the passage of the country’s Gender Recognition Act. But the ruling now elevates them to the status of an existential threat. Astonishingly, the ruling specifies that what it calls “women living in the male gender”—i.e., trans men, and cis women whose appearance is deemed masculine—“could also be excluded” alongside cis men, from women’s spaces. “Not being allowed into the mens by rule does not mean you have the right to go into the ladies,” clarified the leading anti-trans campaigner Maya Forstater; “That may seem unfair, but these are life choices people make. If you make extreme efforts to look like a man don’t be surprised if you are denied entrance to ladies.” Forstater’s comments underscore the ultimate goal of TERFs and other transphobes: to expunge trans people from public life. Predictably, the all-white, majority-male panel of judges, who heard from no trans people or groups at all in connection with the case, insist that their destruction of trans women’s legal standing qua women vis-à-vis the UK Equality Act is not a defeat for the trans community at all. Trans people in Britain are still protected as trans people by a separate provision in the Equality Act, so the apologists argue; thus, no one loses. But given that institutions are already scrambling to impose penalties on all and any persons suspected of trespassing on the “wrong” side of sex-segregated facilities—if for whatever reason they cannot, or will not, provide proof of assigned sex at birth—it’s unclear to me if anyone really believes this. The fact, already now, is this: If I am perceived not to be what I say I am, and I don’t have the relevant documents, I can be strip-searched by male transport police, and legally barred from single-sex spaces. Trans people will, of course, continue to live lives of authenticity, but make no mistake: Everyone’s bodily autonomy is curtailed (especially those of us who, cis or trans, are poor, undocumented, racialized, intersex, gender non-conforming) by the cisfeminist diktat against non-cis humanity’s existence in public. The decades-long coordinated attack on trans rights paves the way for the unraveling of the Equality Act as a whole, and the dismantling of every (limited but important) legislative gain for social justice achieved since 1998’s explosive “Lawrence Inquiry” into institutional and police racism in the UK. The playbook is now all set to merge with the American one “defending women against gender ideology extremism” (per the White House’s executive order of January, which seeks to make human sexuation, as it were, great again). Hitherto, to suggest as much has typically incurred incandescent indignation on the part of feminism’s Brexiteers—the self-styled anti-woke left-liberal single-issue cissexists whose reactionary brand has long been hegemonic in the UK. This camp has long promoted itself as profoundly un-American. But, increasingly, its hatred of the Black, abolitionist, gender-abundant, utopian international left supersedes its patriotism, leading it to align itself with MAGA (unlikely inheritor of the “true” feminism the left abandoned) without shame. The rationale offered for the retraction of trans people’s right to be men and women in society (rather than un-men and un-women) boils down to the word “biology.” Yet the word does not appear in the Equality Act, and the judge explicitly declines to define it, declaring that the “biological characteristics” corresponding to the “plain and unambiguous words [‘man’ and ‘woman’] are assumed to be self-explanatory and to require no further explanation.” As the archivist Morgan Page summarized it acidly, “apparently the UK Supreme Court will know women when they see them,” this being the litmus test for pornography put forward by the US Supreme Court in the 1960s. The comparison to obscenity law is no idle one. “Deep in the judgment,” noted the barrister Dave Renton, “is an idea of trans people as moral contaminants.” For half a century, the drive to purify womanhood of perversity has indeed undergirded the minority branch of Anglo American women’s liberationism that, in 2008, was dubbed “TERF.” (A better label than “TERFism,” in my view, would have been “cisfeminism” or “cultural feminism,” since there really is nothing radical about the ideology, even though it is feminist.) One lurid antecedent of the feminist misogyny—yes!—at the heart of TERFism is the ecofeminist theologian Mary Daly’s femmephobic 1978 screed Gyn/Ecology: the Meta-Ethics of Radical Feminism, which pours infinitely more contempt on femininity and “artificiality” than it does on patriarchy. Expounded via lynch mob–esque interventions in lesbian spaces by figures like Sheila Jeffreys in England and Robin Morgan in the United States, this fringe feminism was considered reactionary by most radical feminists already in 1973. Preferring the term “gender-critical,” 21st-century TERFs have protested for years that TERF is a misogynistic slur; still, the more of British society they’ve captured, the more they’ve grown content with the moniker. “Welcome to Team TERF,” gloats UnHerd every time an A-lister turns transphobe. “2023 is the year of the TERF,” declares the far-right rally Let Women Speak. “We will fight,” jokes Rowling in another revealing effort to claim Churchillian glory for her cause, “on the beaches of TERF Island.” The copious “strong borders” imagery readily reveals TERFism to be a female cultural nationalism or sexual nationalism, premised—Brexit-style—on the securitization of the tacitly white and innocent body politic against dysgenic gender “refugees.” The pogrom-inciting tenor of what has been called “the trans debate” was normalized from the get-go by feminism’s moral alibi and the nepotism of Britain’s commentariat class. The hyper-respectability of many of its ringleaders surely didn’t hurt, either. Helen Joyce, one of the most influential trans-annihilationists currently heralding the Supreme Court decision as a personal win, is a former editor at The Economist. Her buddy the celebrity anti-trans philosopher Kathleen Stock is a royally honored academic. Rowling, of course, is a national treasure. Meanwhile, the publishing industry has glutted itself on trans-“skeptic” books just asking questions—not just by Joyce and Stock—and these all receive rave reviews in the UK Guardian. (Back in 2018, the US office of that newspaper was even moved to denounce its British counterpart over its participation in the self-styled “feminist” moral panic.) The riddle of “TERF Island” continues to intrigue those international onlookers who intuit feminism and transphobia to be opposites. Unlike the supposedly very different—crassly “polarized” and “partisan”—makeup of the American fight for trans rights, in Britain it’s a point of pride that genteelly genocidal anti-gender-ism cuts across Conservative, Labour, and feminist milieus. (Right on cue, the Labour government hailed the Supreme Court decision, with Prime Minister Keir Starmer saying he was “really pleased” with the “clarity” it provided, and his spokesperson saying that Starmer no longer believes that trans women are women.) Hearteningly, on Saturday, the UK also saw widespread gigantic anti-TERF protests of the Supreme Court decision, suggesting some degree of popular rejection of the cissexist “common sense” that was explicitly deployed in the court. This epistemic pseudo-realism that we nowadays so often see violently invoked by figures as superficially disparate as J.K. Rowling and D.J. Trump—on matters ranging from woman-definition to immigration—is, to borrow from the historian Ann Stoler, a colonial common sense. This is also paradoxically why TERFism, like all fascist discourses and all imperial and settler-colonial horizons, imagines itself upside-down, as somehow preyed-upon, bullied, colonized, and at risk of genocidal erasure at the hands of the subjugated group it dehumanizes. More pressing matters than metaphysical and/or state recognition of one’s sex often preoccupy individuals in the trans community. The core scourges of trans life in the UK include: poverty, medical under-service, labor market exclusions, sexual violence, housing discrimination, and a media climate of brutal mockery, scapegoating, and stigma. Conversely, in the baseless narrative propagated via the British establishment’s long-standing hate fest around trans-ness, trans women constitute a powerful, sinister sexual threat to ladies, lesbians, and little boys and girls, all of whom are at the mercy of this phantasmic social plague of predatory and fetishistic “men” brandishing pieces of paper that falsely declare them female so as to access “single-sex spaces” where they don’t belong and carry out all manner of evil. (Trans men were usually, until now, an afterthought in TERF politics: harmless at best, traitors to womankind at worst. Thanks to For Women Scotland, though, they might not be able to legally pee in public at all.) In the multifaceted fight against fascism ahead of us, many voices will be raised to re-explain at length, again and again, why trans women are women and trans men are men. Debunking the bad sexological science that well-spoken eugenicists like Helen Joyce propound is certainly a worthwhile task, since it often dazzles the uninitiated and gives pause to the uncertain. But the more important priority, for my money, remains the refusal of TERFs’ very terrain of argument. Jeet Heer John Nichols Elie Mystal Books & the Arts / David Klion Feminism does not, and has never, in fact, required a definition of “woman.” To the contrary, while “enemy feminisms” (as I call them) have repeatedly attempted to ontologize and naturalize sex, other feminisms, over the centuries, have pursued the struggle against sexual hierarchy as an all-encompassing utopian endeavor whose present and future constituencies are necessarily moot: Much of revolutionary feminism, for example, remains agnostic about whether “women” will definitely exist after patriarchy, especially given how many female subjects—Indigenous, enslaved, disabled, queer, sex-working—have been excluded from womanhood in the past. Cisness brutalizes us all. The border guards of sex are the enemies of human liberation, and we fight them best by refusing to debate the fairness, let alone the accuracy, of their borders in the first place. “Womanhood is not assigned. It is lived, sacred, and sovereign,” as the joint statement by the Muslim-led feminist Transfuturist and Ad’iyah collectives following the Supreme Court ruling reminds us. “We do not and will never recognize the authority of any government court or institution to determine our legitimacy. They do not know us—and they can never name us.” Update: This piece originally said that the Supreme Court panel that issued the ruling was all-male. In fact, it was majority-male. The chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week. Trump’s catastrophic “Liberation Day” has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called “enemy aliens” are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire. At a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump’s intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account. In just the last month, we’ve published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration’s appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities. We also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections—like Wisconsin’s recent state Supreme Court race—that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can’t buy our democracy.

By STAN CHOE, AP Writer NEW YORK (AP) — U.S. stocks rose Wednesday as a worldwide rally came back around to Wall Street after President Donald Trump appeared to back off his criticism of the Federal Reserve and his tough talk in his trade war. The S&P 500 climbed 1.7% and added to its big gain from Tuesday that more than made up for a steep loss on Monday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 419 points, or 1.1%, and the Nasdaq composite gained 2.5%. Wall Street’s gains followed strong moves higher for stocks across much of Europe and Asia. They also continued a dizzying, up-and-down run for financial markets as investors struggle with how to react to so much uncertainty about what Trump will do with his economic policies. The market’s latest move was up in part because Trump said late Tuesday that he has “no intention” to fire the head of the Federal Reserve. Trump had been angry with Jerome Powell, whom Trump had called “a major loser,” because of the Fed’s hesitance to cut interest rates. Trump’s tough talk had frightened investors because the Fed is supposed to act independently, without pressure from politicians, so that it can make decisions that may be painful in the short term but are best for the long term. While a cut to interest rates by the Fed could give the economy a boost, it could also put upward pressure on inflation. Economists say Trump’s tariffs are likely both to slow the economy and to raise inflation, at least briefly. Trump may have recognized the market’s fear about a move against Powell. He may also be looking to keep someone around whom Trump could blame later if the economy does fall into a recession, according to Thierry Wizman, a strategist at Macquarie. “Indeed, if the Fed cuts its policy interest rates aggressively, Trump would have little excuse for a recession apart from the pugnacity of his tariff policies,” Wizman said. Markets also rose after Trump said late Tuesday that U.S. tariffs on imports coming from China could come down “substantially” from the current 145%. “It won’t be that high, not going to be that high,” Trump said. The hope along Wall Street has been that Trump would lower his tariffs after negotiating trade deals with other countries, and Trump said Tuesday he would be “very nice” to the world’s second-largest economy and not play hardball with Chinese President Xi Jinping. “There is an opportunity for a big deal here,” U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Wednesday. If Trump brings his tariffs down enough, investors believe a recession could be averted. U.S. businesses say they’re already feeling the effects of the trade war. A preliminary reading of U.S. business activity fell to a 16-month low, as the threat of tariffs helped push up prices charged for goods and services, according to S&P Global’s latest survey released Wednesday. All the uncertainty means one of the few predictions many along Wall Street are willing to make is that sharp swings for financial markets will continue for a while. The market will “more likely than not continue to be dictated by Trump’s latest whims regarding tariffs and trade,” said Tim Waterer, chief market analyst at KCM Trade. The S&P 500 remains 12.5% below its record set earlier this year after briefly dropping roughly 20% below the mark. Its swings have been coming not just day to day but also hour to hour as Trump and his administration’s officials continue to surprise markets. On Wednesday alone, the S&P 500 charged to a 3.4% gain in the morning, only to more than halve that rise as the day progressed. Trump’s latest comments had a relaxing effect on the bond market, where Treasury yields eased. It’s a turnaround from earlier this month, when spiking Treasury yields raised fears that Trump’s actions were scaring investors away from the United States and weakening the U.S. bond market’s reputation as one of the safest places to keep cash. The yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 4.38% from 4.41% late Tuesday. It dropped as low as 4.26% earlier in the morning. On Wall Street, Big Tech helped lead stock indexes higher. Nvidia rose 3.9% to claw back more of the sharp losses it took last week, when it said U.S. restrictions on exports of its H20 chips to China could hurt its first-quarter results by $5.5 billion. The chip company’s stock was the strongest single force lifting the S&P 500. Other stocks in the artificial-intelligence technology ecosystem also drove higher. Vertiv Holdings, which traces its roots to the industry’s first manufacturer of computer room air conditioning, jumped 8.5% after reporting stronger profit and revenue for the latest quarter than analysts expected. It said it’s continuing to see accelerated demand from AI data centers. Super Micro Computer, a company that makes servers used in AI, rose 7.6%. Palantir Technologies, which offers an AI platform for customers, climbed 7.3%. Tesla revved 5.4% higher after CEO Elon Musk said he’ll spend less time in Washington and more time running his electric vehicle company after Tesla on late Tuesday reported a big drop in profits. It’s been struggling because of backlash against Musk’s efforts to lead cost-cutting efforts by the U.S. government. All told, the S&P 500 rose 88.10 points to 5,375.86. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 419.59 to 39,606.57, and the Nasdaq composite gained 407.63 to 16,708.05. In stock markets abroad, indexes jumped 2.1% in France, 2.4% in Hong Kong and 1.9% in Japan. Stocks in Shanghai were an exception, where they dipped 0.1%.
