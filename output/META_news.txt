According to official updates from the brand's manufacturing partner, inventory began tightening on March 11, 2025, as Aqua Sculpt sales spiked, prompting growing concern from customers about product authenticity and future restock timelines. Starting in late February, Aqua Sculpt saw a sharp uptick in demand across its authorized distribution network. Verified fulfillment partners reported rapid sellouts within days of restocking, attributed primarily to a surge in online orders from customers seeking trusted weight management solutions. The brand confirmed that the unexpected growth, primarily via direct-to-consumer platforms, placed temporary pressure on logistics and supply chains. Retail insights from March 1 to March 18, 2025, indicate a remarkable 730% increase in units sold compared to the previous year's timeframe. The influx of traffic to verified sellers highlights a consumer trend favoring secure, trustworthy channels to purchase wellness supplements like Aqua Sculpt. Concerned about counterfeit products, many customers visited the official Aqua Sculpt website for real-time availability and authenticity assurance. Manufacturer Responds to March Supply Constraints with Mitigation Measures On March 15, 2025, the manufacturer issued a public update outlining strategies to manage the demand surge. This included accelerating production timelines, expanding batch sizes, and optimizing warehouse-to-fulfillment operations. Aqua Sculpt remains in active production, but the speed of incoming orders temporarily outpaced standard restocking rhythms. A company spokesperson reassured customers that authorized retail partners continue to receive inventory on a rolling basis. Buyers are strongly advised to avoid third-party listings from unknown sources and instead rely on the official Aqua Sculpt site for verified product updates and restock alerts. Q2 to Bring Increased Supply Stability for Aqua Sculpt While March's inventory strain led to intermittent product unavailability, the brand anticipates improved supply levels moving into Q2. Strategic increases in production capacity, packaging infrastructure, and distribution coordination have been implemented to meet projected demand through May and June 2025. Verified retail partners will receive priority shipments as part of this ramp-up strategy. Customers seeking legitimate purchasing options are urged to consult the official Aqua Sculpt website, which lists all authorized sellers and includes tools to verify retail sources before checkout. Spike in Counterfeit Listings Prompts Consumer Warning With Aqua Sculpt's popularity growing, a rise in unverified listings on third-party marketplaces has sparked concern among loyal customers. Reports of counterfeit versions circulating under similar branding have emerged, prompting Aqua Sculpt to release an official warning advising customers to purchase only through approved channels. In response to complaints of mismatched packaging, inconsistent labeling, and questionable ingredients, the brand has doubled its message: Aqua Sculpt is available exclusively through its official website and verified retail partners. Consumers unsure about a listing's authenticity are encouraged to cross-check product details and seller information directly through Aqua Sculpt's official portal.

The Science Behind Aqua Sculpt Ingredients: How Circadian Rhythm, Metabolic Thermogenesis, and Natural Compounds Combine for Effective Weight Management Aqua Sculpt is more than just another name in the world of natural weight loss support — it represents a scientifically inspired synergy of bioactive compounds that align with your body's natural rhythms to promote sustainable fat metabolism, appetite regulation, and enhanced energy expenditure. Backed by emerging research on circadian biology, thermogenic enhancers, and plant-derived bioactives like green tea catechins, caffeine, and L-theanine, Aqua Sculpt leverages your body's internal clock and metabolic pathways to unlock effective results. Circadian Rhythms and Fat Metabolism: Working With Your Body's Biological Clock Circadian regulation is one of the most overlooked aspects of weight management — the internal timing system influencing metabolism, hormone secretion, and energy balance. According to a landmark study published in Scientific Reports, titled "Circadian regulation in human white adipose tissue revealed by transcriptome and metabolic network analysis," researchers found that human fat cells exhibit distinct gene expression patterns based on the time of day, particularly in genes involved in lipid metabolism and insulin signaling (Nature, 2019). This discovery implies that fat cells work in metabolic "shifts," performing lipogenesis (fat storage) during certain times and lipolysis (fat breakdown) during others. Aqua Sculpt is formulated to enhance fat oxidation during peak fat-burning phases — primarily in the morning and early afternoon — by combining bioactives that synergize with the body's natural energy peaks. This circadian-informed approach helps avoid metabolic disruptions and supports a smoother, more effective weight-loss process by "sculpting" fat burn into your daily biological schedule. Caffeine and Green Tea Catechins: Thermogenic Duo That Boosts Energy Expenditure Caffeine, a well-known stimulant found naturally in coffee and tea, is a key ingredient in Aqua Sculpt. Its inclusion is backed by multiple studies showing a positive association between caffeine intake and successful long-term weight loss maintenance (PubMed, 2015). It works primarily by increasing thermogenesis — the body's heat production process that directly correlates with calorie burn — and by stimulating lipolysis, the breakdown of fat into usable energy. Even more impressive is the combination of caffeine with green tea extract, particularly epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a potent catechin known for its fat oxidation properties. A clinical study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition showed that this combination increased 24-hour energy expenditure and fat oxidation, making it highly effective for supporting weight management in healthy individuals (AJCN, 1999). Another randomized trial showed that green tea catechins significantly reduced body fat and cardiovascular risks, supporting its place in a comprehensive weight loss strategy like Aqua Sculpt (Wiley Online Library, 2007). L-Theanine: Calm Focus and Craving Control To balance the stimulating effects of caffeine, Aqua Sculpt also includes L-theanine, an amino acid found in tea that promotes relaxation without drowsiness. Multiple studies have found that combining L-theanine with caffeine leads to enhanced cognitive performance, reduced anxiety, and greater subjective alertness — all without the jittery side effects often associated with stimulants (PMC, 2015; PubMed, 2010). Moreover, L-theanine has been shown to modulate neurotransmitter activity, which may help reduce emotional eating and stress-induced cravings. By promoting a calm, focused mental state, Aqua Sculpt helps users control their eating habits, a critical — yet often overlooked — aspect of successful weight management. Synergistic Support for Glucose Control and Insulin Sensitivity Blood sugar balance plays a significant role in fat storage and energy regulation. Aqua Sculpt's green tea catechins are thermogenic and help improve insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism. A 2013 meta-analysis of 17 randomized controlled trials found that green tea supplementation significantly reduced fasting glucose and improved insulin function, supporting its use in weight-related metabolic support (AJCN, 2013). When blood sugar is stable, the body is less likely to store fat and more likely to use glucose efficiently for energy. This creates a metabolic environment that promotes fat loss rather than fat gain — a cornerstone of Aqua Sculpt's approach. Additional Thermogenic Support from Green Coffee Bean Extract and L-carnitine Beyond green tea, Aqua Sculpt also integrates green coffee bean extract, a natural source of chlorogenic acid. When combined with caloric restriction, this acid has been shown to modulate lipid metabolism and assist in fat burning (APJCN, 2017). L-carnitine, an amino acid derivative that helps transport fatty acids into mitochondria, which are converted into energy, further amplifies fat-burning potential. A systematic review and meta-analysis confirmed that L-carnitine supplementation is associated with significant reductions in body weight and fat mass, especially when combined with physical activity (PubMed, 2016). These ingredients create a multi-pronged metabolic support system that enhances energy levels, promotes efficient fat metabolism, and aids in long-term weight control. Aqua Sculpt and Long-Term Weight Management: More Than Just a Quick Fix Many products promise short-term weight loss but fail to support sustainable habits. Aqua Sculpt's science-backed ingredients are strategically chosen to support long-term metabolic flexibility, energy balance, appetite control, and cognitive clarity — all essential for losing weight and keeping it off. Longitudinal research from the Women's Health Initiative Dietary Modification Trial also reinforces the importance of sustainable changes. Over 7 years, participants on low-fat diets achieved modest but statistically significant weight loss, highlighting that consistent lifestyle choices, supported by metabolic enhancers like Aqua Sculpt, yield lasting results (WHI, 2006). Aqua Sculpt as a Science-Driven Daily Ritual Aqua Sculpt is designed as a supplement and a science-informed daily wellness ritual. It leverages your body's circadian rhythm, supports your metabolic engine with natural thermogenic compounds, and enhances mental clarity to make more intelligent eating and lifestyle decisions. By integrating powerful ingredients like green tea extract, caffeine, L-theanine, L-carnitine, and green coffee bean extract, Aqua Sculpt acts in harmony with your biology — not against it. The result? A sustainable, energizing, and body-friendly approach to weight management that helps you sculpt the best version of yourself — naturally and effectively.

Title: inZoi early access review
URL: https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/inzoi-early-access-review
Time Published: 2025-03-26T14:00:00Z
Full Content:
Soulless simulation I was, like so many of my 1990s-born peers, a huge Sims girlie. I spent hundreds of hours as a teen and young adult making people I knew, characters from shows I was obsessing over, or original characters I wanted to experiment with, and diligently following their life paths and ambitions. I played it as a traditional life sim and I also got into all the weird, scrappy lore. I played with all the cheats and glitches and I, of course, put my sims in the pool and took the ladder out so that they were forced to drown. Try as I might, I could not capture any of these feelings in InZOI, Krafton’s early access life simulator that I would not typically immediately compare to another game if it did not beg for it by lifting every part of its design from the 25-year-old series that defined the genre. At first, navigating my shiny, photorealistic, model-perfect Zoi’s around the shiny, photorealistic, model-perfect world, I feared that I am simply thirty years old and that the whimsy in my heart has withered with time. But in the end, I must insist that it’s not me who is wrong. InZOI simply has awful vibes. Starting where you have to start: in character creation. Zois, the game’s controllable characters, are rendered in minute, slightly uncanny valley detail. Absolutely everybody is beautiful, with flawless skin and hair, and god forbid you want to make a fat person. You’ll have to choose between a “male” and a “female” body, and even though you can then set your Zoi’s gender as male, female, or nonbinary, you’ll still be locked into a lot of the baggage those body types imply. You can’t have a beard on a female body, for example. In short, for a life simulator, you can really only simulate a plastic-y, pared down sort of life. The Sims also has its limitations, but its cartoonish style gives it more leeway. InZOI’s photorealism implies a world close to our own, and so its delineations between the possible and the impossible feel more charged. This is not only true of character creation. When you’re done making Zois and ready to get into the game, there’s plenty to do: build a career, skills, and hobbies; explore the world and visit locations; and navigate relationships with other Zois. But each of these is just as shallow. Careers, skills, and hobbies are progressed straightforwardly. Your Zoi will have an overlapping set of ambitions and drives to push you towards choosing something among the cacophony of options. Take, for example, Eddie Jenkins, who desires a life of excitement, is a joyful and cheerful adventurer, and values accomplishment. These presumably influence the autoselected ambition to become a fitness star, so I put him to work. First, he wants to buy some home gym equipment, and then use it three times. This is easy enough. He then wants to read 10 fitness books and level up his fitness score to six. This takes a few days of steady reading, and since reading also increases the skill score, there’s not much else to it. He then spends three days doing pull ups to finish the entire ambition by hitting a fitness level of ten. This whole thing took maybe a week in-game and maybe an hour of real time. I could have spread this out with other activities, of course, but everything else feels just as vapid. Eddie works as an amusement park employee three days a week – this is considered a full time job – during which time he goes and walks around the boardwalk, loosely interacting with vending machines and rides. His housemate Helen, who is a journalist, sometimes pops up to ask how she should proceed in working on an article. Twice in a row with a couple of days of separation she discovered that her editors were up to something shady and got a bonus for calling them out, but the amusement park doesn’t seem to have any equivalent speedbumps. Eddie walks around. He gestures vaguely at the bins. Sometimes, he, like all Zois, gets a fleeting desire to do something different, like go boxing or talk to someone about his accomplishments. This changes his mood, which theoretically makes it easier to do certain tasks, except that all tasks are frictionless, so in practice it does nothing. Eddie’s intangibility at work extends to any interaction outside of the Zoi’s home. InZOI boasts of its open world; you can walk around as a Zoi and…look at things, I suppose. But I don’t know why you would want to. InZOI doesn’t seem to think it’s worthwhile either: if you actually choose to go somewhere specific, your Zoi will hop on a bus or into a taxi and the world will be replaced by a loading screen. These areas are where a self-driven narrative ought to open up for the creative player, if InZOI had the scaffolding to support it. It does not. You can interact with objects in these locations a thousand different ways, but all of them feel as intangible as doing 72 hours of pullups for no reward. One aspect which does potentially contain some of the creative spark I was hoping for is the building mechanics. I was never good at this; my Sims lived in ugly, boxy homes covered in mismatched wallpaper and the same cheap paintings. But I do remember the ability to have bowling alley carpets and bizarre, fun sculptures, and InZOI will let you put a badly looping gif of a firework on your walls and an ice cream truck in your garden, which I think is important. (Any of the pre-built homes you move your Zois into will, of course, be immaculately furnished as if by cutting-edge though somewhat sterile interior designers, so I have no doubt players can also create these kinds of homes if they want to and have skills that I do not.) Finally, there’s getting to know other Zois. There’s a waterfall of options you can speak to other characters about, from mint chocolate to mental health. Some of them are truly bizarre, like “say your soul chose you,” or “say life is but one layer of a dream.” A lot of them feel like this game is written by the worst people on LinkedIn: every Zoi is obsessed with AI, crypto, and the stock market. They all want to become influencers and are constantly thinking about social media metrics. (The game is also not properly localised yet, with a lot of leftover Korean and some broken strings showing hanging HTML tags.) It’s near impossible to leave Zois unattended and also build the social life you’re aiming for, because they will insult people at the drop of a hat and derail whatever you’ve been working on. And not just insult, either. At one point after I swapped away from the wife in a married couple who I had just instructed to spend several minutes talking about how much she wanted a divorce, and she immediately texted her husband saying she thought things were going great these days. I really could go on with detailing all the ways that InZOI’s vibes are simply not good, but here’s a final big one: the whole game is wrapped in this Assassin’s Creed-like meta layer where you’re actually controlling (?) a game developer (??) who works at a building full of cats (???) and is then controlling (????) the Zois in turn. The only thing this does for the game is add a veneer of corporate soullessness to the whole thing. Alongside the terrifyingly flawless faces and bodies of every Zoi, their obsession with being influencers, and the meaningless achievement grinding as a replacement for opportunities to find real stories to tell, it seems that the only thing I’m simulating is an endless “9-5 in the life of a corporate girlboss” TikTok trend. And, honestly, I find that an insult to every weird teenage girl who’s ever spent the weekend in the Sims burning their family lot to the ground so that they can seduce the grim reaper.

Title: Will Microsoft be laid low by the feds’ antitrust probe?
URL: https://www.computerworld.com/article/3852913/will-microsoft-be-laid-low-by-the-feds-antitrust-probe.html
Time Published: 2025-03-26T10:00:00Z

Microsoft is on top of the world right now, riding its AI dominance to become the world’s second-most valuable company, worth somewhere in the vicinity of $3 trillion, depending on the day’s stock price. But that could easily change — and not because competitors have found a way to topple it as king of AI. A federal antitrust investigation threatens to do to the company what was done to it 35 years ago by a US Justice Department suit that tumbled the company from its perch as the world’s top tech company. It also led to a lost decade in which Microsoft lagged in the technologies that would transform the world — the internet and the rise of mobile. The current investigation was launched last year by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) under the leadership of Chair Lina Khan. Khan was ousted by President Donald J. Trump when he re-took office in January, and there’s been a great deal of speculation about whether his administration would kill the investigation or let it proceed. That speculation ended this month, when new FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson asked the company for a boatload of information about its AI operations dating back to 2016, including detailed requests about its training models and how it acquires the data for them. The investigation isn’t just about AI. It also covers Microsoft’s cloud operations, cybersecurity efforts, productivity software, Teams, licensing practices, and more. In other words, just about every important part of the company. Although the investigation is a broad one, the most consequential parts focus on the cloud, AI, and the company’s productivity suite, Microsoft 365. It will probably dig deep into the way Microsoft uses its licensing practices to push or force businesses to use multiple Microsoft products. Here’s how The New York Times describes it: “Of particular interest to the FTC is the way Microsoft bundles its cloud computing offerings with office and security products.” The newspaper claims the investigation is looking at how Microsoft locks customers into using its cloud services “by changing the terms under which customers could use products like Office. If the customers wanted to use another cloud provider instead of Microsoft, they had to buy additional software licenses and effectively pay a penalty.” That’s long been a complaint about the way the company does business. European Union regulators last summer charged that Microsoft broke antitrust laws by the way it bundles Teams into its Microsoft 365 productivity suite. Teams’ rivals like Zoom and Slack don’t have the ability to be bundled like that, the EU says, giving Microsoft an unfair advantage. Microsoft began offering some versions of the suite without Teams, but an EU statement about the suit says the EU “preliminarily finds that these changes are insufficient to address its concerns and that more changes to Microsoft’s conduct are necessary to restore competition.” Microsoft’s AI business is also in the legal crosshairs, though very few details have come out about it. However, at least part of the probe will likely center on whether Microsoft’s close relationship with OpenAI violates antitrust laws by giving the company an unfair market dominance. The investigation could also focus on whether Microsoft uses its licensing practices for Microsoft 365 and Copilot, its generative AI chatbot, in ways that violate antitrust laws. In a recent column, I wrote that Microsoft now forces customers of the consumer version of Microsoft 365 to pay an additional fee for Copilot — even if they don’t want it. In January, Microsoft bundled Copilot into the consumer version of Microsoft 365 and raised prices on the suite by $3 per month or $30 for the year. Consumers are given no choice — if they want Microsoft 365, they’ll have to pay for Copilot, whether they use it or not. Microsoft also killed two useful features in all versions of Microsoft 365, for consumers as well as businesses, and did it in a way to force businesses to subscribe to Copilot. The features allowed users to do highly targeted searches from within the suite. Microsoft said people could instead use Copilot to do that kind of searching. (In fact, Copilot can’t match the features Microsoft killed.) But business and educational Microsoft 365 users don’t get Copilot bundled in, so they’ll have to pay an additional $30 per user per month if they want the search features, approximately doubling the cost of the Office suite. It’s almost certain the feds will file at least one suit against Microsoft by the FTC, the Justice Department, or maybe both. After all, federal lawsuits against Amazon, Apple, Google, and Meta launched by the Biden administration have been continued under Trump. There’s no reason to expect he won’t target Microsoft as well. There’s another reason the feds could hit Microsoft hard. Elon Musk is suing OpenAI and Microsoft, claiming their relationship violates antitrust laws. He’s also spending billions to compete against them. Given that he’s essentially Trump’s co-president — as well as being Trump’s most important tech advisor — it’s pretty much a slam dunk that one more federal suit will be filed. As one piece of evidence that suits are coming, the FTC weighed in on Musk’s side in his suit against the company and OpenAI, saying antitrust laws support his claims. In a wink-wink, nudge-nudge claim that no one believes, the agency says it’s not taking sides in the Musk lawsuit. Expect the investigations into Microsoft to culminate in one or more suits filed against the company. After that, it’s anyone’s guess what might happen. The government could ask that Microsoft be broken into pieces — perhaps lopping off its AI arm. It could even ask that the cloud as well as AI be turned into their own businesses. Or it could go a softer route by fining the company billions of dollars and forcing it to change its business practices. Either way, hard times are likely ahead for Microsoft. The big question will be whether CEO Satya Nadella can weather the turbulence better than Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer did when the previous federal suit against the company laid it low for a decade.

Title: 3 Things Marketers Should Know About Magna’s 2025 Ad Forecast Update

Time Published: 2025-03-26T06:00:00Z
Full Content:
We deliver! Get curated industry news straight to your inbox. Subscribe to Adweek newsletters. Today, Magna released its spring update to its U.S. Ad Forecast report for 2025, and the results focus on what the market looks like during an uncertain time. Magna found that U.S. ad sales reached $380 billion in 2024, as fourth-quarter earnings were strong across the board. This reflects a more than 12.4% increase (+9.9% excluding cyclical spending). However, Magna, which already expected a down year in 2025, is reducing that forecast even more. “Confidence plays a crucial role in marketing and advertising investment decisions. The current—hopefully temporary—dip in confidence has already dampened the dynamics of the ad market, prompting U.S. to revise our growth forecast for 2025,” Vincent Létang, evp, global market intelligence, Magna, and co-author of the report, said in a statement. “While total ad spend is still expected to grow in the mid-single digits, digital media ad sales will continue to experience high-single-digit growth. In contrast, most traditional media channels may face stagnating ad revenues this year.” Here are some of the standout points and key takeaways from the report: Magna predicts that the lack of visibility and risk of a trade war may cause marketing and advertising budgets to either freeze or result in cuts in industries that are vulnerable to global trade, supply chain disruptions, and consumer confidence issues. That includes consumer packaged goods companies, in food, drinks, and personal care, as well as quick-service restaurants and the automotive industry. These industries account for a sizeable share of ad spend in the U.S., but there are still large, growing industry verticals that are not particularly sensitive to global costs or economic fluctuations, like pharmaceuticals, retail, tech/telecoms, entertainment, finance, and insurance. Moreover, endemic and organic growth factors (media innovation, retail media, ad-supported streaming) that drove ad spend faster than the general economic growth in recent years will continue to make advertising formats more effective, efficient, and attractive to brands and encourage advertisers to maintain or develop advertising budgets. Considering the various business and economic factors, Magna has reduced its 2025 ad market growth forecast from +4.9% in December 2024 to +4.3%. Non-cyclical ad sales will grow by +6.7% (previous forecast +7.3%). Still, some categories will continue with robust revenues. For instance, digital pure players (DPP) in search, retail media, social media, digital video, and digital audio (such as Google, Meta, Amazon, and Spotify) will see ad revenue grow by +9.6% to $293 billion. Magna points out that traditional media owners (TMO) (categories that fall under television, premium long-form streaming, audio media, publishing, out-of-home advertising, and cinema) are more vulnerable when a lack of business visibility leads some marketers to prioritize short-term KPIs and lower-funnel channels. Because of this, Magna expects TMOs’ non-cyclical ad sales to decline by -1% to $103 billion, while cross-platform TV sales stabilize, with growth in ad-supported streaming (+14%) helping to offset an ongoing decline in linear ad sales (-7%). Ad-supported streaming—which includes FAST channels and all premium long-form streaming platforms like Hulu, Peacock, Netflix, Prime, etc.—benefits from growing reach and viewership as 75% of all streaming hours are now ad-supported, up from 58% a year ago, per Magna. Among other highlights, sports will continue to grow for TV with content such as the college football playoffs, the WNBA on Prime Video, and exclusive NBA games on Peacock. Meanwhile, out-of-home (OOH) ad sales are predicted to grow by more than 4.8% this year to $10 billion, driven by double-digit growth in digital OOH revenues. However, other traditional media channels may struggle in 2025. For instance, Magna forecasts a decrease of -2% for audio media and publishing ad revenues, with digital ad formats not being able to offset declines on legacy formats. Magna predicts that audio media will account for $16 billion, while publishing will account for $15 billion. 3 Big Takeaways Marketers Should Know About Magna’s 2024 US Ad Forecast The Magna report explores how business and consumer confidence deteriorated since January due to several factors, such as the stock market recording decreases and the cost of food rising. Though overall food costs did not rise in Q1—staying around 3%—U.S. consumers were shaken by the sharp inflation in eggs, which is typically a food staple of American households. The combination caused a drop in the consumer confidence index, which decreased from 74 in December to 58 in March, close to the all-time low recorded in June 2022 when gas hit $5 per gallon in the wake of the Ukraine invasion. When it comes to the economic outlook on the U.S. ad market, the research notes how the core economic fundamentals like consumer price index (CPI) inflation, job market, retail sales, and corporate profits stayed healthy. Additionally, international trade tensions don’t necessarily lead to extensive economic damage. However, the current confidence crisis has already impacted economic activity in Q1, and Magna expects negative GDP growth for the first quarter and cautious investment and marketing spending in the months ahead.

March 25, 2025 21:00 ET | Source: Bragar Eagel & Squire Bragar Eagel & Squire NEW YORK, March 25, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Bragar Eagel & Squire, P.C., a nationally recognized shareholder rights law firm, reminds investors that class actions have been commenced on behalf of stockholders of Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS), Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: MRVI), AppLovin Corporation (NASDAQ:APP), and Manhattan Associates, Inc. (NASDAQ:MANH). Stockholders have until the deadlines below to petition the court to serve as lead plaintiff. Additional information about each case can be found at the link provided. Skyworks Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS) Class Period: July 30, 2024 - February 5, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025 According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning Skyworks’ expected revenue for the fiscal year 2025. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in Skyworks’ ability to expand its mobile business and capitalize on its growth potential by investing in new technologies to diversify its portfolio of offerings. On February 5, 2025, after market close, Skyworks announced its financial results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 and provided lower-than anticipated revenue guidance for the second quarter of fiscal year 2025. The Company attributed its results and low guidance to a “competitive landscape” that had “intensified” in recent years. Following this news, the price of Skyworks’ common stock declined dramatically. From a closing market price of $87.08 per share on February 5, 2025, Skyworks’ stock price fell to $65.60 per share on February 6, 2025, a decline of over 24% in the span of just a single day. For more information on the Skyworks class action go to: https://bespc.com/cases/SWKS Maravai LifeSciences Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: MRVI) Class Period: August 7, 2024 - February 24, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: May 5, 2025 On February 25, 2025, before the market opened, Maravai announced it was postponing its fiscal 2024 earnings release and would delay filing its annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024. The Company had identified an error in revenue recognition that “resulted in approximately $3.9 million in revenue being recorded in the final week of the second quarter of 2024 upon shipment when it should have been recorded in the first week of the third quarter of 2024 upon receipt by the customer.” The Company had identified “a material weakness in its internal controls over revenue recognition.” Maravai also required additional time to “complete its assessment of a potential non-cash impairment charge related to goodwill associated with its previous acquisition of Alphazyme LLC.” On this news, the Company’s share price fell $0.87, or 21.70%, to close at $3.14 per share on February 25, 2025, on unusually heavy trading volume. The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) Maravai lacked adequate internal controls over financial reporting related to revenue recognition; (2) as a result, the Company inaccurately recognized revenue on certain transactions during fiscal 2024; (3) its goodwill was overstated; and (4) that, as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

In truth, AppLovin was exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms and using manipulative practices that forced unwanted apps on customers via a “backdoor installation scheme” which inaccurately inflated installation numbers, and, in turn, its profit figures, the complaint alleges. The AppLovin class action lawsuit further alleges that on February 26, 2025, analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inflate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures, the complaint alleges. On this news, the price of AppLovin shares fell by more than 12%, the AppLovin class action lawsuit alleges.

(NASDAQ:MANH) Class Period: October 22, 2024 - January 28, 2025 Lead Plaintiff Deadline: April 28, 2025 The Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants provided investors with material information concerning Manhattan Associates' expected revenue for the fiscal year 2025. Specifically, the Complaint alleges that Defendants' statements included, among other things, confidence in the Company's ability to forecast guidance despite macroeconomic fluctuations, the growth potential of their professional services offerings, and the ability for their cloud revenue to drive revenue for its professional services. On January 28, 2025, Manhattan Associates issued a press release reporting its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year 2024. Among other items, the Company disclosed services revenue of $119.5 million for the quarter, growing by only 0.3% compared to the year-ago quarter and falling approximately $2 million short of the guidance provided in October 2024. Manhattan Associates attributed the results to delays in professional services work and deferred deals, predicting that the Company's services revenue would reach a low point in the first quarter of 2025 and that solid revenue growth would not resume until mid-year. Manhattan Associates further revealed emerging challenges in its services business, noting that around 10% of customers with ongoing implementations had scaled back their planned services work for the upcoming calendar and fiscal year. The Company also announced that its 2025 revenues would see modest growth of just 2% to 3%, while GAAP EPS was expected to decline by 10% to 13%. On this news, Manhattan Associates' stock price fell $72.26 per share, or 24.49%, to close at $222.84 per share on January 29, 2025. Then, on February 10, 2025, Manhattan Associates announced that Eddie Capel, Manhattan's President and Chief Executive Officer, would retire from those positions effective February 12, 2025. On this news, Manhattan Associates' stock price fell $23.20 per share, or 11.55%, to close at $177.70 per share on February 10, 2025.

Elon Musk’s X, formerly known as Twitter, has experienced a drop off in U.S. user traffic since November’s presidential election—when he used his account to rally support for President Trump—while rival social media platforms Threads and Bluesky have seen significant increases, according to data from digital market intelligence company Similarweb. Musk purchased Twitter for $44 billion in 2022. (Photo by Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images) X’s daily web visits are down an average of 8.4% to 31.7 million from November through March 21, after briefly spiking during the election and largely plateauing in the proceeding days, while average daily app users (iOS and Android combined) are down 7.2% to 25 million in that same window of time, according to Similarweb. Meta’s Threads platform had the largest daily app user increase since November, boasting a 14.9% increase to 13.6 million daily users since then. However, Threads’ average daily web visits are the lowest, occasionally reaching above the 1 million mark since November. Bluesky maintained a post-election boom with Similarweb reporting average daily web visits up 21.5% from November to 2.3 million while average daily app users are up 2.3% to 1.5 million. Bluesky has mostly managed to keep its number of daily app users above 1.5 million since the election, marking a roughly threefold jump since the start of November, when active users numbered around 540,000.

X’s daily web visits (calculated on a day-by-day basis) have fallen to 30.6 million since its Election Day peak of 46.5 million, according to Similarweb. Meanwhile, daily active iOS and Android users on X have slid 22.1% from Election Day to March 21, to 24.3 million, according to Similarweb. Unclear. Musk made thousands of posts to his over 200 million followers during the election that garnered over 33 billion views, according to The Washington Post. But Musk, who endorsed and funded Trump in the election and gained popularity among right-wing social media users, has since navigated a turbulent 2025. The billionaire received criticism for his role overseeing Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency, concern he’s neglecting his role heading Tesla, which has seen a steep stock price drop, and continued backlash against a gesture he made in January likened to a Nazi salute, as well as Nazi-related posts and puns he published on X. Some high-profile users flocked to Bluesky from X over the latter platform’s increasing popularity among the right-wing, as well as Musk’s amplification of right-wing stances on immigration, transgender people, diversity, equity and inclusion programs, voter fraud and more. Public figures such as actor Mark Hamill, journalist Don Lemon, author Stephen King, director Guillermo del Toro and others outright left X or reduced their posts on Musk’s platform following the election. Bluesky was regularly promoted—and derided—on X as a more Democrat-leaning alternative. Bluesky was co-founded by former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey and has been propped up as a partisan alternative platform to X, one that also allows users to make text-based posts and message others. The app was invite-only until last year and also allows users to block others, a welcome feature for some who have taken issue with the block feature on X. X no longer blocks users from seeing public posts from a user that has blocked them. Meta’s Threads platform was launched in 2023 as a competitor to X, and positioned as a way to “enable positive, productive conversations,” attempting to distance the platform from the partisan rancor on X. Threads posts are integrated into Instagram and Facebook feeds, making it easy for users on either platform to visit the app. Threads’ monthly active users reached 320 million in January, according to Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, a 45 million user increase from November.

Title: Bitcoin Outperforms Tesla in Standard Chartered’s “Magnificent 7” Index
URL: https://zycrypto.com/bitcoin-outperforms-tesla-in-standard-chartereds-magnificent-7-index/
Time Published: 2025-03-25T18:31:10Z
Full Content:
A recent Standard Chartered report reveals that swapping Tesla for Bitcoin in the “Magnificent 7” index enhances returns and reduces volatility. Notably, the “Magnificent 7” index traditionally includes stocks of major tech giants, including Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, and Tesla. However, in the newly devised model, Standard Chartered’s Head of Digital Asset Research, Geoffrey Kendrick, removed Tesla, the smallest company in the index by market capitalization of around $800 billion, and replaced it with Bitcoin, which currently boasts a market cap of approximately $1.7 trillion. According to Kendrick, the decision to substitute the electric manufacturer with Bitcoin was based on Bitcoin’s increasing role in financial markets. “This tells us that the Mag 7 portfolios would have benefited over the past seven years from adding BTC and excluding TSLA,” he stated. The analysis found that the revised “Mag 7B” index has outperformed the traditional Mag 7 by about 5% since December 2017. Additionally, the Bitcoin-included index demonstrated nearly 2% lower volatility on average compared to the original lineup. Kendrick emphasized that these findings suggest Bitcoin is not only a hedge against traditional financial risks but also behaves similarly to high-performing technology stocks. The pundit also pointed out that Bitcoin’s correlation with the Nasdaq is stronger than its correlation with gold, reinforcing the argument for its classification alongside tech equities. “If it were included, the implication would be more institutional buying as BTC would serve multiple purposes in investor portfolios,” he added. Notably, Bitcoin’s growing institutional adoption, particularly following the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs in early 2024, has made trading the cryptocurrency as seamless and cost-effective as dealing in traditional tech stocks. He also highlighted a notable shift in Bitcoin’s trading behavior. Since the inauguration of U.S. President Donald Trump in January 2025, Bitcoin’s price behavior has mirrored Nvidia’s on a volatility-adjusted basis. In contrast, he noted that Tesla now trades more similarly to Ethereum. “Since the launch of spot ETFs, Bitcoin investment has become more institutionalized,” Kendrick noted, adding, “We believe BTC should be viewed as a multi-functional instrument in investor portfolios; this will open up the opportunity for even more institutional buying.” That said, Kendrick noted he remains optimistic about Bitcoin’s near-term prospects, citing its increasing correlation with the stock market, which is rebounding from its worst quarter since mid-2022. “Higher Nasdaq will equal higher Bitcoin. $90,000 in focus now,” he said, referencing Bitcoin’s next major price target. Bitcoin’s integration into high-profile investment indices and its performance compared to traditional tech stocks further cement its role in institutional portfolios. As more institutional investors recognize Bitcoin’s multi-functional utility, its inclusion in mainstream financial indices could become a reality in the future. At press time, Bitcoin was trading at $87,628, reflecting a 0.36% surge in the past 24 hours.

Title: Broadcom's AI Boom: How High Can This Semiconductor Giant Go?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/gurufocus/2025/03/25/broadcoms-ai-boom-how-high-can-this-semiconductor-giant-go/
Time Published: 2025-03-25T15:37:32Z

ByGuruFocus ByGuruFocus Contributor. By Nabeel Bukhari Broadcom Inc is a semiconductor giant, making the chips and infrastructure that power the most advanced computing systems in the world. Broadcom’s technology is everywhere, whether it’s the hyperscalers such as Amazon and Alphabet training large AI models or enterprises integrating AI-driven applications. But the more interesting thing is that the company just delivered another blowout quarter, with revenue exploding and AI-related sales skyrocketing. It's also very profitable, with a very high expected adjusted EBITDA margin, which is rare in semiconductors. Despite a premium valuation, Broadcom's future still looks bright with strong cash flow and noteworthy partnerships. Also, as the stock has dropped 16% YTD, this dip might be a buying opportunity before the next leg up and the stock could continue to surprise investors. The question is, how high can Broadcom go? Let's dive in to find out. Broadcom crushed estimates in its first quarter of fiscal 2025. The AI hardware leader beat on earnings-per-share (EPS) of $1.60 by 9 cents and significantly surpassed revenue expectations of $14.92 billion, $330 million ahead of estimates. The 25% year-over-year (YOY) revenue growth of the company is a result of continued heavy investment by data centers and hyperscalers upgrading their AI infrastructure. Infrastructure software revenue clocked in at 47% and Broadcom's semiconductor solutions revenue grew 11% year over year on broad-based demand across its portfolio. Now, let’s talk a bit about AI spending, which is only accelerating, placing Broadcom to ride a long-term tailwind. Tech giants like Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Apple are shelling out in order to stay at the forefront of the AI race, and Broadcom is benefiting from their activities. The company's Q1 AI-related revenue increased 77% compared to the previous year to $4.1 billion, which is clear evidence of the growing demand for its AI-optimized chips and connectivity solutions. And this is only the beginning. The data center and AI-related hardware and software market are seen as expanding at a ridiculous 40-55% annually toward $1.4 trillion by 2027. As more and more industries increasingly adopt AI usage in their business processes, the demand for AI infrastructure will quickly increase and Broadcom is well set to take a large portion of it. Strong free cash flow momentum: Beyond top-line growth, Broadcom's free cash flow (FCF) increased even faster than revenue, which is evidence of strong cash generation and operational efficiency by Broadcom. The company generated a FCF of $6.0 billion, up 28% YOY. This figure outpaced revenue growth by three percentage points. It also meant a 40% FCF margin, up 1 percentage point quarter-over-quarter and validating Broadcom's ability to reinvest in growth, pay down debt and return capital to shareholders. Since Broadcom is executing flawlessly and AI demand is growing rapidly, the company should continue to deliver brilliant results in the quarters ahead. Q2 FY25 looks just as strong as well. Revenue is expected to come in around $14.9 billion, which is a strong 19% YOY increase, a symbol that the demand for its products is not slowing down anytime soon. And with no surprise, the biggest driver is AI. Broadcom's AI semiconductor revenue alone is expected to be around $4.4 billion in the quarter due to hyperscalers spending on AI XPUs and connectivity solutions. This is a huge tailwind, and it resonates with the importance of Broadcom's tech in driving the AI revolution. Finally, their profitability with an expected 66% adjusted EBITDA margin is more impressive. That's rare in semis, but such a mix of high-value AI chips and infrastructure software of Broadcom maintains fat margins. Broadcom is pushing the semiconductor innovation boundaries as hyperscalers step it up on AI investments. Its tech has become extremely essential, and the company's Q2 expectations in AI semiconductor revenue are a testament to that. The company is pouring resources into R&D to keep ahead, putting focus on cutting-edge AI XPUs and networking. It is developing a 10,000 teraflops XPU with 2nm 3.5D packaging and scaling AI clusters to 1 million XPUs on Ethernet. On the networking side, it has doubled RAID capacity and is prepping 1.6T bandwidth switches for sampling. These advancements in AI will be game-changers in the AI accelerator industry. Strategically, Broadcom is winning big. Just recently, two more hyperscalers tapped Broadcom for AI XPUs in order to draw on its stature as a key enabler of AI infrastructure. Now the company is making Alphabet’s Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), Microsoft's Maia, Amazon's Trainium and Inferentia, Meta Platforms' MTIA, and ByteDance's AI ASIC chips, essentially providing the custom silicon for the biggest names in AI. Broadcom's balanced model of high-margin software and AI-driven hardware is shown by this deep integration across most of the major cloud and AI players and the VMware-driven enterprise software growth. If Broadcom continues at this speed, the company might cement itself as one of the most powerful forces in AI infrastructure. Broadcom has done an excellent job of maintaining an earnings consistency track record, having either met or beaten EPS estimates in every quarter over the past few years. Such outperformance speaks to the company's business model's enduring power as well as the ability to drive continued growth. Broadcom Inc Price Chart Investors have taken notice as Broadcom's stock price has surged 53% over the past year and a whopping 931% over the past half-decade. This performance is not simply luck but instead reflects the company's strategic positioning in AI-driven semiconductors and enterprise software. Broadcom Inc EPS Quarterly Estimate Chart Looking ahead, Broadcom is set to post robust earnings and revenue growth. The EPS for FY2025 and FY2026 are projected to increase substantially YOY, at $6.62 and $7.86 respectively. Nonetheless, seeing how Broadcom has a track record of exceeding estimates, it can do the same in the future as well. If Broadcom delivers results in line or above the past quarters by the same margin of say 3-5%, then its EPS for FY2025 can touch $6.80-$6.95 and for FY2026 can cross $8.00. This means that the potential of this outperformance will make its valuation even more attractive. Premium price? Not really: Broadcom's forward P/E at 28.7 may seem elevated at first glance compared to traditional value stocks. However, as stated above, premium valuations are justified if a company generates superior growth. Broadcom's earnings trajectory supports its multiple in its case. A deeper look at Broadcom's Price-to-Earnings Growth (PEG) ratio provides further evidence that it is relatively cheap. The stock is trading at a PEG ratio of 1.31, based on a forward P/E of 28.7 times and a matching EPS growth rate. Broadcom's PEG indicates that the company is attractively priced in view of its strong earnings trajectory and is notably 18.75% lower than the sector median of 1.67. The bottom line is that despite the premium valuation of Broadcom, the stock is still relatively cheap when one takes into consideration its growth rate. With a solid track record of consistent estimate beats and strong EPS and revenue growth, Broadcom has a lot of room to run. In FY2025, EPS is forecasted to be $6.62, rising to $7.86 in FY2026 and higher. This implies a short-term price target of about $205 to $210 (based on FY2025 estimates) given this company's forward P/E of approximately 28.7 times. In the long-term, EPS is expected to rise to $9.12 in FY2027 and $12.74 in FY2028. If it happens, a conservative P/E multiple of about 21 times implies the stock should trade near $280-$290 in 3-4 years. Broadcom Inc EPS Quarterly Estimate Trends Bullish case scenario: If Broadcom exceeds estimates, due to AI demand, networking expansion, and software growth, EPS would grow faster than expected. If EPS reaches $7.00 in FY2025 and $8.25 in FY2026, and the market rewards Broadcom with a higher multiple of 32 times P/E, the stock could trade above $235 in the short-term. And if EPS hits $10.50 by FY2027 and $14.00 by FY2028, a 23-25 times P/E multiple would take the stock to $350-$375 within the next few years in the long-term bullish case. Broadcom Price Target Scenarios Broadcom insiders have been selling a notable amount of stock over the past year, which naturally piques some eyebrows. CEO Hock Tan sold $26 million worth of shares at $173 each, one of the biggest sales. It seems concerning, but as it was only 10% of his holdings, it's not necessarily a red flag. In addition, insider selling dropped in the past three months and no insider sales occurred in the past month, perhaps implying that the company's executives hang on to their shares after Broadcom's latest earnings release. Furthermore, Broadcom's 1.3% insider ownership worth $14 billion is still a good thing. It is not a huge stake, but it is a statement that executives and important decision-makers have an interest in the company's long-term success. Institutional investors are stepping in: Although there have not been any insider buys recently, institutional investors are increasingly confident in Broadcom's long-term potential, even as insiders are cashing out. Institutional buying tends to outweigh insider selling, as these funds are taking a long-term, research-backed approach. Broadcom Inc Number of Guru Trades While some gurus are taking profits or rebalancing, trades demonstrate a steady accumulation trend, which implies that large funds see Broadcom as a stock they want to hold or add to at current levels. One of the standout among them is Ken Fisher, the founder of Fisher Investments who currently has 23.9 million shares. Fisher uses tech stocks heavily in bull markets, as they are supposed to lead the rally. According to him, Broadcom is a key pillar of market strength, and his large stake in his firm reflects his confidence that the stock will continue to be this way. Balancing debt repayment with growth potential: Broadcom's insider selling could be deemed a strategic move of offloading shares at premium valuations to repay debt. Broadcom took on a big bet on debt with its $69 billion VMware acquisition and has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.14 which is very low, so it makes sense to lower leverage. That said, the company has enough free cash flow to reinvest in innovation while improving its balance sheet. If Broadcom continues to grow at such a pace, the dilution from insider sales may be minimal and the company may be able to grow past any concerns, making these insider sales a natural part of its financial strategy, not a reason to worry. Broadcom's growth trajectory is still very compelling, but a few risks may counter its bullish outlook. The biggest risk is Broadcom relying on Apple. Beginning with the iPhone 17 in 2H25, Apple's transition to in-house Wi-Fi chips could have a big impact on Broadcom's sales. This revenue stream may decline, provided Apple fully phases out Broadcom's chips over the next three years. Another concern is valuation risk. If growth fails or doesn't merit these superior multiples, Broadcom might face downward pressure. Lastly, profitability concerns remain. While sales are growing, gross margin expansion must be sustained. Investors would shift out of Broadcom if it grows revenue but cannot keep the margin momentum. Broadcom is in a perfect situation to take advantage of the AI boom and enjoy solid top and bottom-line growth. The long-term risk from Apple's move toward in-house chips is a big one, but the stock's AI momentum is more than enough to make up for lost revenue. Valuation too continues to be a point of debate, but the history of beating estimates and AI demand surging make its premium multiple justified. Insider selling might also make investors worry, which is justified and should be kept an eye on, but investors should not finalize their bet on a stock based on it. There are many other watch factors, for instance, maintaining profitability. Broadcom can stay ahead as long as it continues to expand margins with revenue growth. For now, the stock looks well positioned for long-term upside.

Title: An AI bubble threatens Silicon Valley, and all of us

An AI bubble threatens Silicon Valley, and all of us. by Bryan McMahon March 25, 2025 5:30 AM This article appears in the April 2025 issue of The American Prospect magazine. Subscribe here. The week of Donald Trump’s inauguration, Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, stood tall next to the president as he made a dramatic announcement: the launch of Project Stargate, a $500 billion supercluster in the rolling plains of Texas that would run OpenAI’s massive artificial-intelligence models. Befitting its name, Stargate would dwarf most megaprojects in human history. Even the $100 billion that Altman promised would be deployed “immediately” would be much more expensive than the Manhattan Project ($30 billion in current dollars) and the COVID vaccine’s Operation Warp Speed ($18 billion), rivaling the multiyear construction of the Interstate Highway System ($114 billion). OpenAI would have all the computing infrastructure it needed to complete its ultimate goal of building humanity’s last invention: artificial general intelligence (AGI). Art for this story was created with Midjourney 6.1, an AI image generator. But the reaction to Stargate was muted as Silicon Valley had turned its attention west. A new generative AI model called DeepSeek R1, released by the Chinese hedge fund High-Flyer, sent a threatening tremor through the balance sheets and investment portfolios of the tech industry. DeepSeek’s latest version, allegedly trained for just $6 million (though this has been contested), matched the performance of OpenAI’s flagship reasoning model o1 at 95 percent lower cost. R1 even learned o1 reasoning techniques, OpenAI’s much-hyped “secret sauce” to allow it to maintain a wide technical lead over other models. Best of all, R1 is open-source down to the model weights, so anyone can download and modify the details of the model themselves for free. It’s an existential threat to OpenAI’s business model, which depends on using its technical lead to sell the most expensive subscriptions in the industry. It also threatens to pop a speculative bubble around generative AI inflated by the Silicon Valley hype machine, with hundreds of billions at stake. Venture capital (VC) funds, drunk on a decade of “growth at all costs,” have poured about $200 billion into generative AI. Making matters worse, the stock market’s bull run is deeply dependent on the growth of the Big Tech companies fueling the AI bubble. In 2023, 71 percent of the total gains in the S&P 500 were attributable to the “Magnificent Seven”—Apple, Nvidia, Tesla, Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, and Microsoft—all of which are among the biggest spenders on AI. Just four—Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta—combined for $246 billion of capital expenditure in 2024 to support the AI build-out. Goldman Sachs expects Big Tech to spend over $1 trillion on chips and data centers to power AI over the next five years. Yet OpenAI, the current market leader, expects to lose $5 billion this year, and its annual losses to swell to $11 billion by 2026. If the AI bubble bursts, it not only threatens to wipe out VC firms in the Valley but also blow a gaping hole in the public markets and cause an economy-wide meltdown. The basic problem facing Silicon Valley today is, ironically, one of growth. There are no more digital frontiers to conquer. The young, pioneering upstarts—Facebook, Google, Amazon—that struck out toward the digital wilderness are now the monopolists, constraining growth with onerous rentier fees they can charge because of their market-making size. The software industry’s spectacular returns from the launch of the internet in the ’90s to the end of the 2010s would never come back, but venture capitalists still chased the chance to invest in the next Facebook or Google. This has led to what AI critic Ed Zitron calls the “rot economy,” in which VCs overhype a series of digital technologies—the blockchain, then cryptocurrencies, then NFTs, and then the metaverse—promising the limitless growth of the early internet companies. According to Zitron, each of these innovations failed to either transform existing industries or become sustainable industries themselves, because the business case at the heart of these technologies was rotten, pushed forward by wasteful, bloated venture investments still selling an endless digital frontier of growth that no longer existed. Enter AGI, the proposed creation of an AI with an intelligence that dwarfs any single person’s and possibly the collective intelligence of humanity. Once AGI is built, we can easily solve many of the toughest challenges facing humanity: climate change, cancer, new net-zero energy sources. And no company has pushed the coming of AGI more than OpenAI, which has ridden the hype to incredible heights since its release of generative chatbot ChatGPT. Last year, OpenAI completed a blockbuster funding round, raising $6.6 billion at a valuation of $157 billion, making it the third most valuable startup in the world at the time after SpaceX and ByteDance, TikTok’s parent company. OpenAI, which released ChatGPT in November 2022, now sees 250 million weekly active users and about 11 million paying subscribers for its AI tools. The startup’s monthly revenue hit $300 million in August, up more than 1,700 percent since the start of 2023, and it expects to clear $3.7 billion for the year. By all accounts, this is another world-changing startup on a meteoric rise. Yet take a deeper look at OpenAI’s financial situation and expected future growth, and cracks begin to show. “Big Tech Incinerates Its Fortune,” in the style of Vincent van Gogh To start, OpenAI is burning money at an impressive but unsustainable pace. The latest funding round is its third in the last two years, atypical for a startup, that also included a $4 billion revolving line of credit—a loan on tap, essentially—on top of the $6.6 billion of equity, revealing an insatiable need for investor cash to survive. Despite $3.7 billion in sales this year, OpenAI expects to lose $5 billion due to the stratospheric costs of building and running generative AI models, which includes $4 billion in cloud computing to run their AI models, $3 billion in computing to train the next generation of models, and $1.5 billion for its staff. According to its own numbers, OpenAI loses $2 for every $1 it makes, a red flag for the sustainability of any business. Worse, these costs are expected to increase as ChatGPT gains users and OpenAI seeks to upgrade its foundation model from GPT-4 to GPT-5 sometime in the next six months. Financial documents reviewed by The Information confirm this trajectory as the startup predicts its annual losses will hit $14 billion by 2026. Further, OpenAI sees $100 billion in annual revenue—a number that would rival Nestlé and Target’s returns—as the point at which it will finally break even. For comparison, Google’s parent company, Alphabet, only cleared $100 billion in sales in 2021, 23 years after its founding, yet boasted a portfolio of money-making products, including Google Search, the Android operating system, Gmail, and cloud computing. OpenAI is deeply dependent on hypothetical breakthroughs from future models that unlock more capabilities to boost its subscription price and grow its user base. Its GPT-5 class models and beyond must pull godlike capacities for AI out of the algorithmic ether to create a user base of hundreds of millions of paid subscribers. Yet, with the release of the open-source DeepSeek R1 model earlier this month, OpenAI has no moat for its increasingly expensive products. The R1 matched its performance across math, chemistry, and coding tasks, independently learned OpenAI’s reasoning techniques, and can be downloaded, modified, and deployed for free. Why would people continue to pay $20, let alone the $200 tier OpenAI reserves for its latest, greatest models, rather than use something that can deliver the same performance at a 95 percent lower price? Venture capital funds, drunk on a decade of “growth at all costs,” have poured about $200 billion into generative AI. Wall Street asked itself the same question after the release of DeepSeek R1 and panicked, wiping more than 15 percent ($600 billion) off Nvidia’s stock price, the largest single-day loss for a company ever. And that’s not the only bad sign Altman received about OpenAI’s future. OpenAI is in talks again to raise more money (less than a year after raising $10 billion) at a proposed $340 billion valuation. In most cases, a startup doubling its valuation would be great news. But for OpenAI, the money may make things worse. It signals a desperate need for cash and puts more pressure on a company that today loses $2 for every dollar it makes. As Zitron pointed out, at $340 billion, few companies have the liquidity to acquire OpenAI, and public investors expect strong returns and profitability to justify an IPO anywhere near that price. Plus, the latest round of funding is being led by Masayoshi Son, a billionaire investor known more for losing money than making it. Given Son’s Vision Fund’s disastrous investing record, Zitron said, it’s as bearish a signal as you could find. Hanging over all this for OpenAI is the fact that Microsoft’s investments in the company, which run north of $10 billion, are not standard equity investments but “profit participation units” that will convert to debt in a year and a half. It’s not just OpenAI that’s burning through billions. Silicon Valley has hyped AI as the next internet or iPhone, and has invested like it cannot afford to miss out on the next big tech revolution. In 2021, with the last gasp of zero-interest-rate loans paired with trillions in COVID relief spending, venture capitalists poured a record $78.5 billion into the AI space. And, despite a broader slowdown in venture activity, the second quarter of 2024 set the record for quarterly venture investing in AI at $23.3 billion. In fact, 33 percent of VC portfolios are committed to AI, another worrying sign of concentration. … in the style of Hokusai Even so, Big Tech companies are the biggest spenders on AI. While VCs dropped approximately $200 billion into AI between 2021 and 2024, Big Tech is on pace to surpass that amount this year alone. According to Goldman Sachs research, cloud computing giants are expected to plow over $1 trillion over the next five years into graphics processing units (GPUs) and to build data centers to power generative AI. AI is an expensive technology like few before it. All those racks of GPUs and supercluster data centers need power, and the power industry is also embarking on a once-in-a-generation investment spree to keep up. The scale of expected data centers to power generative AI is difficult to wrap your head around. Oracle recently announced plans to build a gigawatt-scale data center just for AI, powered by a trio of nuclear reactors, while OpenAI pitched the White House on the necessity of five-gigawatt data centers, which would be enough power for about three million homes consumed by a single AI data center. A recent report from McKinsey expects the electricity going to fuel AI data centers will triple from 3 to 4 percent of the country’s electricity to 11 to 12 percent by 2030. The power industry typically grows 2 to 3 percent a year, far too little to meet the predicted jump in demand. McKinsey estimates that power utilities would have to spend $500 billion on top of their planned capital expenditure to keep up with AI needs. If true, this presents a serious bottleneck for not just OpenAI but the expected growth of the AI industry. Between VCs, Big Tech, and power utilities, the bill for generative AI comes out to close to $2 trillion in spending over the next five years alone. Adding all this up, some are starting to question the economic fundamentals of generative AI. Jim Covello, head of global equity research at Goldman Sachs, doubts the technology can recoup what’s been invested as, unlike the internet, it fails to solve complex business problems at a lower cost than what’s available today. Plus, he argues, the most expensive inputs for generative AI, GPUs and energy, are unlikely to decline meaningfully for the tech industry over time, given how far demand outstrips supply for both. While AI-fueled coding could definitely boost productivity, it’s hard to see how it could become a multitrillion-dollar industry. Surveys confirm that for many workers, AI tools like ChatGPT reduce their productivity by increasing the volume of content and steps needed to complete a given task, and by frequently introducing errors that have to be checked and corrected. A study by Uplevel Data Labs tracked 800 software engineers using Copilot on GitHub and found no measurable increase in coding productivity, despite this exact use case being the one pointed to the most by AI companies. And even productivity gains may come at a cost: Microsoft researchers concluded that workers became more productive using generative AI tools but their critical thinking skills declined, presumably because they were offloading the thinking to AI. Looking past the hype, the business case for generative AI two years after the stunning success of ChatGPT appears weaker by the day. … in the style of Jacob Lawrence Even worse, as AI expert Gary Marcus pointed out, DeepSeek’s R1 model spells serious trouble for OpenAI and the cloud giants. The only way OpenAI could hope to recoup the billions it was spending on GPUs to train bigger and bigger models was to maintain a large enough technical lead over other AI companies to justify charging up to $200 for paid subscriptions to its models. That lead just vaporized and was given to the entire industry for free. In response, Altman has already twice cut the prices of his subscriptions in an effort to stay competitive. But without millions of paid subscriptions, it’s difficult to see the pathway to profitability for a company that loses $2 for every $1 it brings in and expects costs to continue to grow approximately tenfold in five years. OpenAI has set $100 billion as its break-even point, which would require it to increase its revenue by a factor of 25 in just five years, an incredible feat of scale that its current business model does not justify. OpenAI is, however, the perfect kind of growth-at-all-costs story investors need to think still exists—capable of not only achieving Meta- or Amazon-like growth again, but becoming an indispensable part of growth and innovation in every industry in the future, too. No industry could escape, and software would close its jaws around the world, finally, as Marc Andreessen predicted in 2011. For his part, Gary Marcus has taken to calling OpenAI the WeWork of AI—WeWork, of course, is the poster boy for wasteful, nearly fraudulent, growth-at-all-costs investing that led to a spectacular downfall. Marcus is so confident current approaches cannot take us to the promised land of AGI that he bet Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei $100,000 that AGI would not be achieved by the end of 2027. Without AGI, the valuations of leading AI startups like OpenAI ($340 billion) and Anthropic ($61.5 billion) stop making sense. If GPUs are no longer the most capital-efficient or effective way to build better AI models, then the expected AI computing “supercycle” that the hundreds of billions in capital expenditure is premised on never arrives. Instead, the underlying asset bubble of a multitrillion-dollar bet on GPUs as the necessary component to an internet-like era of growth vanishes into thin air. For many workers, AI tools reduce their productivity by increasing the volume of steps needed to complete a given task. OpenAI’s incredible burn rate, the trillions in capital expenditure by cloud giants and utilities to build out the infrastructure necessary to support AI, the supply bottlenecks ahead from the power and semiconductor industries, and the questionable economic gains from these tools all point to a generative AI bubble. Should the bubble burst, startups and venture funds alike face possible extinction, and a big enough drop from the Magnificent Seven could spark skittish markets to panic, leading to wider economic contagion, given how dependent on the growth of the top technology companies the public markets have become. In 2024, the Magnificent Seven were responsible for the lion’s share of the growth of the S&P 500, with the returns of the other 493 companies flat. When Nvidia hit its peak valuation of $3 trillion over the summer, just five of the seven—Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, and Amazon—accounted for 29 percent of the total index’s value, surpassing the concentration of the five top technology companies just before the dot-com crash. Nvidia has been on an incredible bull run over the last five years, its shares gaining a dizzying 4,300 percent, reminiscent of how network equipment maker Cisco grew about 4,500 percent in the five years leading up to its peak just before the dot-com crash in 2000. Nvidia and the other Magnificent Seven members are in a codependent relationship when it comes to AI hype. They are Nvidia’s biggest customers, feeding the bull run by pushing demand for GPUs beyond even what chipmaker TSMC can supply. At the moment, Nvidia can pass those prices on to their customers, the only clusters big enough for AI computing. But should demand for AI fall, all seven will tumble with it. … in the style of Roy Lichtenstein For the tech industry, DeepSeek is a threat to its incredible bull run because it proved three things. First, frontier AI models could be trained much more cheaply and efficiently than the current Silicon Valley approach of building massive models requiring hundreds of thousands of GPUs to train. From a capital perspective, the U.S. strategy is wasteful, relying on at least ten times the investment to make similar model progress. Second, DeepSeek showed you could train a state-of-the-art model without the latest GPUs, calling into question the current demand for the latest GPUs that is so hot customers have been facing delays of six months to a year to get their hands on them. Finally, the high valuations of leading AI startups depend on a technical lead in their models to charge prices anywhere near what they need to recoup their computing costs, but that technical lead, enabled by a combination of closed-source models, billions in capital expenditure, and export controls blocking Chinese companies like DeepSeek from accessing the latest GPUs, is gone. Should demand for GPUs fall or even not hit the exponential increases the billions invested are betting on, the bubble will pop. Given the stock market’s dependence on tech companies for growth, the trigger may not come from the AI industry itself, but any pullback in spending will crater the current trajectory of the AI industry. Many potential triggers abound: a crypto crash; President Trump’s trade wars with Canada, Mexico, and China; the stated goal to cut more than $1 trillion of government spending by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency; or a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, where nearly 70 percent of the world’s advanced computer chips are manufactured. You can tell Wall Street is worried about a bubble, because Nvidia is hit the hardest by any bearish AI news, and even when the market panic has nothing to do with the tech industry, like when the Japan currency trade happened last summer, the Magnificent Seven suffer punishing losses. The AI bubble wobbles more precariously by the day. Some bubbles, like that of the dot-com crash, end up being positive in the long run, despite the short-term economic pain of it bursting. But some, like the 2008 housing bubble, leave permanent scars on the economy and can knock an entire industry off its growth trajectory for years. To date, the U.S. housing industry has not recovered to pre-2008 growth trend lines, a major contributor to the housing crisis gripping the U.S. That is the fire that the tech industry is playing with today. This is not the Silicon Valley of lore. Venture investors, for all their tech manifestos celebrating “little tech” and entrepreneurship, have come to resemble more traditional financial firms, raising money from pension funds, hedge funds, and sovereign wealth funds. Silicon Valley has gone corporate and managerial; even private equity invests in the Valley today. The fusion of venture capital and Wall Street threatens to bring the unbridled speculation of unregulated finance and the breathless tech industry hype together in a single, massive bubble. Inimical to the old ethos of the Valley and emblematic of a bloated, rotten investing strategy, in Silicon Valley now the money chases founders rather than founders chasing money. Maybe, after the fallout of the AI bubble is felt and the sun sets on Silicon Valley for a bit, the tech world can do a hard reset and return to its more innovative days again.

POSTED BY Amanda Coopersmith RELATED READING Nick Schäferhoff Ben Sailer Ready to build your first website but confused by the technical lingo? In this post, we’ll provide a glossary of terms you might encounter as you build a website. We recommend bookmarking this page for easy reference—like a pocket dictionary you can return to whenever you encounter an unfamiliar term. We’ll focus on WordPress websites throughout, but most of the principles and definitions apply to websites built on any platform. Every website requires a few key technical components. Understanding what each does can help you choose the right location for your site and evaluate different providers. Your site must be stored on physical servers through a website host. Hosting is essentially your site’s place of residence on the internet. Managed hosting (like the hosting plans we have on WordPress.com!) is often an ideal choice for website owners because they take on an active role in running your website. In the case of WordPress.com, we take care of your server setup and the day-to-day management of your website, including security, uptime, and software updates, all for one flat price. A domain is a website’s address, like mygroovywebsite.com. Like physical addresses, every website must have a unique domain name. Domain prices vary depending on the web extension (like .com, .net, .org) and which domain provider you choose, and you can use a domain lookup tool to see what domains are currently available. WordPress.com offers affordable domains with over 350 different domain extensions and averaging just $13/year! Similar to domains, URLs are the specific page addresses for your web pages. URLs are a version of your domain with added information that tells your computer which page to load. So if a website’s homepage is mygroovywebsite.com, subpages have additional path information, like mygroovywebsite.com/about, which would load the website’s about page. Permalinks are permanent URLs that point to a specific piece of content (you can update your default permalink structure on a WordPress site with just a few clicks), while slugs are part of the URL that identifies a specific page (like “about” in our example above). A content delivery network, or CDN, hosts your website on a system of distributed servers instead of one individual server. By utilizing location-specific servers, a CDN improves site speed by delivering content from a server that’s geographically closer to your visitors. Multiple servers also create redundancy, ensuring your site works even when you have a lot of visitors or if a server goes down. All WordPress.com plans have a CDN, powered by 28+ data centers across 6 continents, that puts your content as close to your visitors as possible. An XML sitemap is a list of all of the crawlable URLs on your website so that search engines (like Google) can index and show them in search results. A sitemap helps search engines better understand your site’s structure and how your content is related. A CMS is a tool that helps you build and manage a website without needing to code it from scratch. It provides a user-friendly interface to make it easy to build pages, write posts, and share other content. What is the most popular CMS in the world? WordPress! “Code” is a computer-readable direction written in programming languages. Even if you use a CMS like WordPress to build your site, there’s still a bunch of code running behind the scenes to make everything work and run smoothly. There are many programming languages, but some that you’ll most commonly see when working with WordPress are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) defines the content structure of your website. Think of this as a computer-readable version of your website that includes all the page’s core content, including titles, text, lists, buttons, and images. HTML uses “tags” to define each of these building blocks of your website, like <H1> for top-level headings and <p> for paragraphs. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) defines the style of your website. It is a design reference glossary for the browser, indicating what fonts, colors, sizes, and other elements to use when displaying your website. The cool thing about CSS is that your site updates automatically everywhere when you change a style in your glossary. For example, if you have an <H1> primary header tag in your HTML, the computer will look to the CSS to see what <H1> headers should look like. The CSS might define an <H1> as Arial font, bolded, and 36 pixels. Anywhere that the computer sees the <H1> on your website, it will show that text in Arial font, bolded, and 36 pixels. JavaScript controls the interactive elements of your website that move or change on your otherwise static web pages. JavaScript runs on the user’s side to create animations, popups, banners, alerts, and more. For example, you might use JavaScript to alert users if they didn’t properly fill out a form or to change the screen once they submit it to show them that their response has been received. PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is similar to JavaScript in that it “makes things happen” in real-time on your website. One big difference with PHP is that it runs “server-side,” meaning it changes data or dynamically updates a page’s content before it loads for visitors. PHP is an open source programming language and the language that powers the WordPress software. Metadata helps search engines identify what kind of content is on your website. This allows search engines to know when your website is relevant to someone searching the web for specific information. A title tag is an HTML element used by both search engines and visitors to understand what your webpage is about. Usually, this is the same as the post or page’s headline or title. Meta descriptions are short paragraphs (ideally 120 to 160 characters) that offer additional information to engines about your content. These often include important keywords and phrases. These descriptions may appear in search engine results, so it’s important to write strong, clear descriptions to make your website shine. Schema markup is computer-readable information added to your site’s code to identify different types of content on your webpage. This helps search engines better understand your site’s purpose. Schema markup improves site SEO, contributing important information for search engine snippets and AI-powered search results. For example, recipe plugins provide search engines with this kind of markup, enabling them to showcase recipes in search results with extra details such as images, ingredients, and cook times. Your website’s navigation elements define how site visitors move across your website. You will likely use a variety of navigation elements across your site to meet the specific goals of each page. Your menu is the primary navigation tool for your website, linking to its high-level sections. Menu options may vary depending on your template, including primary navigation menus in your header and footer, sidebar menus from specific pages, and dropdown submenus. “Hamburger menus” are common on mobile views, where detailed headers can take up too much space. These menus are hidden inside a button instead of always being visible in the header. Links are clickable text that take the site visitor to another page. They may direct users to another page on your site (internal links) or an external website (external links). They also help search engines better understand the importance of your site pages—when a page has many relevant links that allow users to navigate to it, search engines will understand that it is a valuable page on your site. Site breadcrumbs show users the “path” they took to reach their current page. For example, on a blog, a user may go from Home > Category > Blog Post. Breadcrumbs are useful on sites with many layers of interconnected pages like stores, forums, or Wikis. Buttons are clickable visual elements that encourage users to take a specific action or navigate to a specific page. A site usually has three “levels” of buttons, with the primary buttons being the biggest and brightest, followed by secondary and tertiary buttons for less important navigation items. Buttons should be strategically placed on your pages to nudge visitors to the most important content or action, such as your storefront or blog. Sharing buttons enable site visitors to easily share content from your website on other platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram, or Pinterest. They are a great way to promote your content cross-platform and build your following organically. Sharing buttons are included for free on WordPress.com with Jetpack. The website header is the content at the top of every page. This section usually includes your logo, site name, tagline, and top-level site navigation (your menu!). The footer is the bottom section of your site, visible below your content on every page. It can contain additional information such as website copyright, contact forms, newsletter subscription boxes, physical addresses, social media links, or lower-priority navigation items like your privacy policy or refund policy. Your website content is what makes your website unique. Whether you are a blogger or a virtual store, your content helps you to create a personalized presence on the web. Your website’s text or copy is anything you write or customize, from menu labels to page titles, blog posts, about pages, and more. Want to learn how to write truly excellent blog copy? Use this blueprint. High-quality and relevant images are an essential part of any website. You can use your own high-quality images, license images through a stock image company, get free unlicensed imagery from sites like Pexels, or generate images with tools like Jetpack AI. Check out our WordPress image size guide to ensure your images are optimized for the web. Videos are widely used on websites because they’re often more engaging than static images. If you have a WordPress site, you can use the YouTube block to easily embed YouTube-hosted videos on your posts or pages. You can also upload your videos directly onto your site. WordPress.com offers 4K video hosting with VideoPress on the Premium plan and above. Sandwiched between your header and footer is your main page. Regardless of the page content or layout, many pages have a few standard parts. Your headline, known in HTML lingo as the <H1>, describes what your page is about; this could be something short like “About” or more specific, like the title of your blog post. You should only ever have one <H1> on a webpage. A website tagline, similar to a brand tagline, is a short, memorable phrase that explains your site’s purpose. Site taglines are usually displayed in the site header next to or under the site title or logo, in search engine results, and in social media blocks. The body content is the meat of your webpage, located between the header and footer. It is specific to each page and includes all of its content elements, such as text, images, and videos. WordPress makes it incredibly easy to add different kinds of content to your posts or pages with its block editor. There are many different blocks that come standard with any WordPress site, allowing you to customize your content exactly how you want. Website pages can vary depending on your site’s purpose, but we recommend a few standard page types for every site. Your homepage is the first page people will visit on your site, so it’s key that it is visually appealing, explains who you are and what you do, and directs visitors to other important pages across your site. Businesses use product or service pages to explain their products and provide pricing. These pages vary in complexity, from simple text lists to full ecommerce stores. Some product and service pages are purely informational; others are interactive, allowing users to purchase products directly from the page. An about page tells your site’s story, whether you’re an individual or a business. This should cover who, what, and why—that is who you are, what you do, and why you do it. You may include your personal or company history, awards or accolades, brand values, and individual or team biographies. Your contact page is where site visitors can find information on how to reach you, whether they want to schedule a meeting, contact you via email, or visit a physical location. This can be a simple text page or include forms, maps, and scheduling tools. A 404 error page alerts visitors if they are trying to visit a web URL that won’t load because the page they’re trying to access doesn’t exist. Users may see a 404 if they mistype a URL or try to access a page that you haven’t created on your site. For example, they may try to go to example.com/about-me when your about page URL is actually example.com/about. You may want to optimize your 404 page to provide assistance to anyone who accidentally sees it with a search bar and links to helpful pages on your site. For many personal and professional websites, the blog is the heart of your site: this is where you will regularly create and post new content. Unlike standard web pages, a blog is designed for easy, ongoing publishing, engagement, and sharing. Need to start a blog? Check out our 12-step guide. A post is a piece of content on your blog. Posts can include text, photos, and videos, but they also have unique elements like status, publish date, author, tags, and categories. These elements enable better navigation, search, and sorting. Posts can be structured in many different ways, but there are a few common types of posts, including lists, how-tos, personal stories, case studies, features, interviews, product reviews, and news articles. Categories help you catalog and sort your blog posts. Categories split your content into a few high-level buckets. Categories should be broad enough to organize all of your posts but specific enough to be meaningful to your readers. Category pages serve as an archive for all content grouped together under a specific category. Similarly, tags group posts together, but they’re more specific ways to describe your content. For example, you may have a “Movies” category and “Adventure,” “Rom-Com,” “Horror,” and “Sci-Fi” tags. You can use multiple tags on a single post, but to avoid clutter and to ensure your tags are useful for finding relevant content, you should only add tags for keywords that recur frequently across your website. There are a variety of reasons people may want to reach out to you through your website. Contact information—whether it’s a public email address, physical address, or form—is an important aspect of any website. You’ll also want to ensure that you have ways for visitors to stay in the loop with what you’re up to. Whether you’re sending out a regular newsletter to your subscribers or sharing your content on social media, content sharing is a key component of a sustainable brand. Contact forms allow website owners to receive messages—like questions, service requests, or feedback—without sharing their email addresses publicly. Visitors put their contact information and requests into a contact form, and the submitted form information is securely forwarded to an email address of your choosing. There are many contact form plugins available, and the Form block is free to use for WordPress.com users with Jetpack. Newsletter signup forms allow site visitors to sign up for your newsletter. These forms have inputs for a visitor’s email address and sometimes their name, and then this information is added to your mailing list. Subscribe blocks are available out-of-the-box for sites hosted on WordPress.com. Plugins are also available for third-party newsletter providers. Social media integrations allow you to connect your blog to your social media platforms. Once these integrations are in place, you can easily pass content back and forth between your website and your social media platforms, posting directly from your blog to your social media sites or embedding your social media feeds directly on your website. An ecommerce website sells goods or services online. WooCommerce, an open source plugin, is a sister company to WordPress.com. This plugin adds key ecommerce features like product pages, shopping carts, and payment processing to your site. Checkout carts are virtual shopping carts that allow visitors to select or save products they want to buy in one place. Checkout carts enable users to keep track of their items and buy multiple products in one transaction. In order for site visitors to be able to make a payment online, you need to use a payment processing software to securely accept credit card information and finalize payments. For sites hosted on WordPress.com, you can easily collect payments through Stripe, the Paid Content block, and PayPal. WordPress websites have their own internal language for different aspects of your site. If you use WordPress as your CMS or WordPress.com for hosting, these terms will help you better understand the tool and all that’s possible with it. WordPress themes are professionally designed templates that you can install and customize. Themes make it simple to start with a base design you really love to then make your own with fonts, colors, images, text, and layouts. WordPress.com has many different themes available to suit every website’s needs and visual style, including free themes and paid third-party themes. You can also install your own third-party themes on the Business plan and above. Plugins are like apps for your website—they extend your site’s functionality and features. The WordPress plugin library offers free and paid plugins for security, SEO, marketing, forms, and more. All WordPress.com users receive free essential functionality through the Jetpack plugin, with additional Jetpack features available at higher tiers. Third-party plugins can be added to sites on the Business plan and above. Patterns are professionally designed page layouts for commonly used web pages, like about pages, photo galleries, storefronts, and contact pages. Patterns use a series of WordPress blocks to build eye-catching layouts that are easy to customize. Blocks (aptly named) are the building blocks of your WordPress website. Blocks are drag-and-drop elements that you can add to any post or page. There are around a hundred unique block types available for text, media, formatting, embedded content, theme-specific designs, forms, and more, with new block types added regularly. With WordPress.com, you get even more with Jetpack-enabled block types. Site backups save previous versions of your website so that you can easily revert your site if something breaks. This can be useful when adding or updating plugins or updating your WordPress version or theme. WordPress.com offers backups with VaultPress on the Business plan and above. Web security is essential to ensure that both your data and your visitors’ data are protected. Security features include general site security to verify your website and block phishing or spam attacks, user-based permissions, and domain privacy to protect your personal data. One benefit of using a managed hosting provider like WordPress.com is that many core security features—like automatic updates, SSL certificates, firewall protection, brute force attack prevention, downtime monitoring, and vulnerability scanning—come included, providing peace of mind for non-technical professionals.

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team Contributor. META Stock Meta Platforms stock (NASDAQ:META) price surged 4% on Monday, March 24, following reports that the Trump administration might refrain from imposing sector-specific tariffs on April 2. [1] At its current price point of around $620, META stock presents an attractive investment opportunity. Our comprehensive analysis evaluates the stock through multiple critical lenses: growth potential, profitability, financial stability, and resilience during market downturns. After a detailed examination of Meta Platforms' recent operational performance and financial health, we find the company demonstrates exceptional strength across key metrics. Despite its seemingly elevated valuation, the underlying fundamentals suggest significant potential for investors. Our assessment reveals a robust financial framework that positions META as a compelling investment choice, supported by its consistent performance and strategic market positioning. The detailed evaluation considers not just surface-level metrics, but a holistic view of the company’s operational capabilities, financial robustness, and capacity to navigate challenging market conditions. This in-depth analysis underpins our confidence in META's investment potential. That said, if you seek upside with lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High-Quality portfolio presents an alternative - having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, META stock looks slightly expensive compared to the broader market. Meta Platforms' Revenues have grown considerably over recent years. Meta Platforms’ profit margins are considerably higher than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. Meta Platforms' balance sheet looks very strong. META stock has been more resilient than the benchmark S&P 500 index during one of the two recent downturns. While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy, how bad can things get if there is another recession? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes. In summary, Meta Platforms' performance across the parameters detailed above are as follows: • Growth: Extremely Strong • Profitability: Extremely Strong • Financial Stability: Extremely Strong • Downturn Resilience: Strong • Overall: Very Strong Overall, despite the stock's elevated valuation, META remains an attractive investment opportunity, bolstered by its strong underlying performance. The company's strategic AI investments are beginning to yield tangible results, particularly in driving user engagement across its platforms. Meta’s core revenue model remains firmly anchored in advertising across its extensive app ecosystem, including Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp. By strategically deploying artificial intelligence, the company is not only refining its ad targeting capabilities but also exploring innovative AI-powered content generation technologies. These initiatives position Meta to potentially unlock new revenue streams and enhance its competitive advantage in the rapidly evolving digital advertising landscape. The convergence of AI technology with Meta’s robust user base and established advertising infrastructure suggests promising growth potential. While it doesn’t look like there is much upside to META stock, the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices) to produce strong returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid- and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provided a responsive way to make the most of upbeat market conditions while limiting losses when markets head south, as detailed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

March 24, 2025 14:31 ET | Source: Levi & Korsinsky, LLP Levi & Korsinsky, LLP NEW YORK, March 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Levi & Korsinsky, LLP notifies investors in AppLovin Corporation ("AppLovin" or the "Company") (NASDAQ: APP) of a class action securities lawsuit. CLASS DEFINITION: The lawsuit seeks to recover losses on behalf of AppLovin investors who were adversely affected by alleged securities fraud between May 10, 2023 and February 25, 2025. Follow the link below to get more information and be contacted by a member of our team: https://zlk.com/pslra-1/applovin-corporation-lawsuit-submission-form?prid=137746&wire=3 APP investors may also contact Joseph E. Levi, Esq. via email at jlevi@levikorsinsky.com or by telephone at (212) 363-7500. CASE DETAILS: According to the complaint, defendants provided investors with material information concerning AppLovin’s financial growth and stability. Defendants’ statements included, among other things, confidence in AppLovin’s launch of its AXON 2.0 digital ad platform and using “cutting-edge AI technologies” to more efficiently match advertisements to mobile games, in addition to expanding into web-based marketing and e-commerce. Moreover, defendants publicly reported impressive financial results, outlooks, and guidance to investors, all while using dishonest advertising practices. The truth emerged on February 26, 2025, when analyst research reports emerged stating that AppLovin was reverse engineering and exploiting advertising data from Meta Platforms. The reports further alleged AppLovin was utilizing manipulative practices to artificially inflate their own ad click-through and app download rates, such as by having ads click on themselves or utilizing design gimmicks to trigger forced shadow downloads, erroneously inflating installation numbers and, in turn, its profit figures. Following this news, the price of AppLovin’s stock declined from $377.06 per share on February 25, 2025 to $331.00 per share on February 26, 2025. WHAT'S NEXT? If you suffered a loss in AppLovin during the relevant time frame, you have until May 5, 2025 to request that the Court appoint you as lead plaintiff. Your ability to share in any recovery doesn't require that you serve as a lead plaintiff. NO COST TO YOU: If you are a class member, you may be entitled to compensation without payment of any out-of-pocket costs or fees. There is no cost or obligation to participate.

To test his theory, Kendrick created a hypothetical "Mag 7B" index, a spin on the Magnificent 7 index, that replaces Tesla with Bitcoin. Normally, the Mag 7 refers to tech giants Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, and Tesla. And traders who had done so in 2017 would be up 5% now, he concluded. If you add Bitcoin to the mix, its $1.7 trillion market capitalization makes it the sixth largest among the group. At the time of writing, Bitcoin has been retracing slightly after getting close to retaking $88,000. BTC has gained 3.7% in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko data. There's more evidence that traders are feeling less uncertain. Open interest in Bitcoin futures contracts has swelled by more than 10% in the past day, according to CoinGlass data. There are currently $57 billion worth of open Bitcoin derivatives contracts. Earlier this month, when markets were acutely feeling the effects of President Donald Trump's tariff troubles, that figure had dropped as low as $45 billion. But now that macroeconomic jitters have eased, traders seem more comfortable buying back into BTC. If BTC had been swapped into the altered Mag7 index—starting in 2017, when Bitcoin had just hit what was then an all-time high—it would have outperformed the Mag 7 by about 5%, Kendrick writes. In addition, traders who swapped Bitcoin for TSLA over the past seven years would have seen fewer price fluctuations, as well. "Perhaps more importantly than returns is Mag 7B’s lower volatility relative to Mag 7 in every year," he added. "Over the full period, average annualized volatility is almost 2% lower for Mag 7B than for Mag 7." Stock correlations have been a hotly contested topic among Bitcoin investors. In the last quarter of 2024, BTC appeared to break away from gold and equities completely and outperformed "every asset class," NYDIG noted. "Furthermore, during the period since President Trump’s inauguration on 20 January, BTC has traded like most of the Mag 7 stocks," Kendrick wrote. "If we compare price declines against [volume] levels over this period, BTC trades in a similar vol-adjusted fashion to NVDA, while TSLA trades a lot like ETH."

Title: Female executives are fighting back against alpha male CEOs
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/female-executives-fightback-alpha-male-tech-bro-zuckerberg-musk-bezos-new-opponent-2025-3
Time Published: 2025-03-24T11:47:17Z
Full Content:
Good morning. Baby boomers' hopes for a comfortable retirement could be at risk if the stock market keeps falling. Financial experts shared key strategies with BI to help protect their savings. In today's big story, female executives are fed up with alpha male CEOs acting like "billionaire boys in the sandbox." Now, they're fighting back. What's on deck Markets: Faith-based investing is having a moment. (And we don't mean confidence.) Tech: Cybersecurity researchers are role-playing with ChatGPT. Business: The rich are taking to the skies for their commutes — Ubers be damned. But first, deprogramming the bro-code. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Lately, boardrooms are brimming with the bro-ish bravado you'd expect to find in a locker room. A buff Mark Zuckerberg wants Meta to celebrate a culture of "aggression." He also likes martial arts and butchering his own meat. 200 push-ups while wearing a weighted vest? No problem. Jeff Bezos (also now buff) laid down the hammer at The Washington Post, demanding editors give him a "hell yes" to affirm they're all in on "personal liberties and free markets." Let's not forget Elon Musk, who over the last several years, has been challenging anyone from Zuckerberg to Vladimir Putin to single combat. Not in the least surprised by all this chest-thumping: women in business. The return of the alpha male CEO has engendered a new opponent, BI's Amanda Hoover writes. Female executives are fed up with the "billionaire boys in the sandbox," as one sociologist put it — and instead of waiting to be let in, some are building their own arenas. Fabrik founder Jaclyn Pascocello told BI that she is seeing a collective of women coming together and starting to build companies to address issues sometimes ignored by men. When companies won't offer the flexibility that working parents need, it can embolden people to become more entrepreneurial and build under their own terms. "Oftentimes the easiest way to find that is to build it yourself," Pascocello said. Amanda spoke with female founders, psychologists, and sociologists about the resurgent machoism in corporate America — and how female executives are fighting back. 1. Praying for returns? Look no further than religious ETFs. Faith-based investments are a small part of the ETF world, but rising religious fervor and President Trump's leadership are driving interest. However, these funds can be picky about what to include. 2. President Trump could be making the same mistake as Biden. Trump's economic policies have some worried about a potential recession, and the stock market has taken a hit. With the 2026 midterms not far off, Trump risks political damage by continuing to ignore the elephant in the room. 3. Has bitcoin already peaked this year? Betting markets seem to think so. They expect the cryptocurrency to reach $110,000, barely above its record price. Wall Street bulls beg to differ. 1. Jensen made a joke, but who's laughing? At Nvidia's big AI conference, CEO Jensen Huang joked that new Blackwell GPUs would render the company's older chip models obsolete. Its cloud giant customers might not find that very funny, though, since it would cost them billions. 2. You can get ChatGPT to make password-stealing malware. Just play pretend. Researchers cracked some LLMs' security features to generate code that could breach Google's password manager. The key? Make the chatbot pretend to be a superhero. 3. A former Point72 exec's new data startup wants to level the playing field. Kirk McKeown's Carbon Arc allows small funds and businesses to purchase private data by the megabyte — sometimes for less than $1. The startup's goal is to make it more accessible for anyone looking to trade or feed AI models. 1. Out: Ubering. In: Blading. The wealthy are ditching hired cars for helicopter services like Blade, where a nine-minute ride from Manhattan to JFK airport starts at $95. When a rush-hour Uber in the city can cost more than $100, that sounds like a deal. 2. Law firms split over Trump's attack. Elias Law Group rebuked Trump's Friday memo that warned firms against "frivolous" suits against his administration. Marc Elias said in a statement on Saturday that there would be "no negotiation" about the clients his firm represents. Meanwhile, after Paul Weiss struck a deal with Trump on Friday, its chairman, Brad Karp, sent an email to staff addressing their unease over the decision. 3. Freebies for federal workers. DC businesses are offering perks like free workout classes and financial planning sessions to federal employees as they navigate the uncertainty around their jobs. BI heard from five businesses on why they're stepping up. The Insider Today team: Dan DeFrancesco, deputy editor and anchor, in New York (on parental leave). Hallam Bullock, senior editor, in London. Grace Lett, editor, in Chicago. Amanda Yen, associate editor, in New York. Lisa Ryan, executive editor, in New York. Ella Hopkins, associate editor, in London. Elizabeth Casolo, fellow, in Chicago.

Title: SEBI Tightens Social Media Ad Rules for Registered Intermediaries
URL: https://www.medianama.com/2025/03/223-sebi-tightens-social-media-ad-rules-for-registered-intermediaries/
Time Published: 2025-03-24T11:45:21Z
Full Content:
MEDIANAMA Technology and policy in India The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has directed registered intermediaries uploading advertisements on social media platforms to use email IDs and mobile numbers registered on the SEBI intermediary (SI) portal while signing up. In an advisory issued on March 21, the regulator also directed such intermediaries to update their contact details on the SI portal by April 30, 2025. Further, Social Media Platform Providers (SMPPs) like Google and Meta would later conduct advertiser verification of such entities. SEBI’s new guidelines come amid rising frauds in the securities market on social media platforms including YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, X, Telegram, and app stores. The regulator noted the patterns like perpetrators luring victims in the guise of providing online trading courses and seminars, furnishing misleading testimonials, or guaranteeing risk-free returns on social media. Besides this, Ananth Narayan, SEBI’s whole-time member (WTM), also announced in a speech that the regulator, in collaboration with social media companies, has removed 70,000 misleading posts and handles since October 2024. However, this is not the first time SEBI has cautioned users and registered intermediaries of such activities on social media. In December 2024, the Board advised investors to not conduct transactions or share sensitive personal details on unauthorised or unregistered electronic platforms, noting that such platforms violate laws like the Securities Contract (Regulation) Act, 1956 and the SEBI Act, 1992. Previously, in August 2024, the Bombay and National Stock Exchanges furnished a joint report urging investors to refrain from joining social media forums like WhatsApp, Telegram, or Instagram channels providing stock recommendations or falsely offering trading opportunities through fake SEBI-issued certificates. The exchanges also highlighted other illegal online activities like offering “dabba” or illegal trading services, claims to facilitate pre-IPO subscriptions with false promises of assured profits, impersonating applications of registered trading members, etc. The intermediaries clarified that victims of such fraud communications can report these through the Sanchar Saathi Portal, the National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal, or the 1930 cybercrime helpline number. Notably, in 2022 SEBI conducted raids in multiple cities across the country for operating Telegram channels which made recommendations of selected listed scrips, creating artificial volume and price rise. In 2024, SEBI also released a consultation paper highlighting when a platform is recognised as a ‘Specified Digital Platform’ (SDP), stipulating that these portals take measures like leveraging AI and ML to curb illegal activity on their platforms and prohibiting associations between unregistered influencers and registered intermediaries. Further, SDPs were directed to enable SEBI and its registered entities to escalate or report unlawful content alongside establishing a mechanism to report misleading content or advertisements. Debating the justification of this regulation, speakers at MediaNama’s discussion on “SEBI Platform and Influencer Regulations” disclosed that the law is all-encompassing and could even impact platforms like WhatsApp where users forward trading advice. Capital Mind Founder and CEO Deepak Shenoy also compared individuals offering free trading advice on platforms like YouTube to similar advice furnished on TV channels, with SEBI cracking down on the former and taking down videos from different creators and channels. Returning to the advisory, it also notes that SMPPs must conduct advertiser verification post the onboarding of such users. Google’s advertiser verification for financial services stipulates that entities must demonstrate that they are licensed by the relevant financial regulatorâSEBI in this caseâand later obtain third-party verification from Google’s vendor G2. Notably, advertisers, such as search engines or e-commerce platforms, who don’t promote financial services but have a “compelling reason to target users” seeking financial advice must also apply to G2. And evidently, only authorised representatives can submit such applications. This requirement for authorisation by relevant regulatory authorities extends to Meta’s advertiser verification process for countries like Taiwan, Australia, and the UK.

New research into how marketers are using AI and key insights into the future of marketing with AI. Updated: 03/24/25 Published: 03/14/25 AI agents are like the backstage crew at the concerts we attend: Operating independently on the backend to deliver a smooth experience on the user end. They power many of the tech we use – and have for a while – but haven’t gotten that visibility until recently. In this article, we’ll break down real-world examples of how AI agents are used across industries. Every time you sift through recommendations on your Netflix, you’re seeing AI agents at work. AI agents take action without constant human intervention by recognizing patterns and predicting behavior. When Netflix is recommending you shows to watch, that rec list has been compiled by an AI agent tasked with analyzing your watch history and ratings for trends and genre preferences. Brands like Amazon, YouTube, and Spotify all use similar agents to personalize user experience. New research into how marketers are using AI and key insights into the future of marketing. All fields are required. Click this link to access this resource at any time. Hotels, ride-hailing apps, and airlines all have one thing in common: Surge pricing – powered by AI agents. These companies operate on a flexible pricing structure that fluctuates based on factors like supply, demand, and user trends. Source Take Lyft for instance. If I order a ride at 2 a.m. on a Saturday during Art Basel, it will surely cost me more than on a Tuesday night at 8 a.m. When the user even places the request for a ride, the AI agent evaluates these factors, sets the price, and responds to the user’s request. OpenAI and Google have both introduced AI agents, – Operator and Mariner respectively – that can search the web independently and serve as a true assistant, filling up shopping carts and getting answers to your most pressing questions. “It can understand that it needs to press a button to make something happen,” Demis Hassabis, who oversees Google’s core A.I. lab, said in an interview with The NYT. “It can take action in the world.” Source While AI assistants escalate support requests and direct users toward self-service options, AI agents are working behind the scenes to: Sites built on user-generated content – think Reddit, YouTube, Meta – require advanced content moderation practices to keep users safe. Human moderators rely on AI agents to do some of the legwork of flagging, reviewing, and sorting content that goes against the site’s policies. Think about how good YouTube has gotten at flagging when a video includes copyrighted music. There’s no human reviewing each upload – instead, Google relies on AI systems to analyze content as they’re uploaded to the site and take actions if they’re not compliant. For instance, on YouTube, an uploaded video will be muted automatically if it includes copyrighted music. On TikTok, a content creator’s video will be first muted, then removed for review. These steps allow moderation teams to focus on higher priority work and automate routine tasks. When you’re spending money on an ad, you’re looking for return on investment (ROI). Doing so entails optimizing your ad after it’s placed – that can mean anything from doubling down on the version that performs the best to customizing the ad based on user history. While this can be done manually, it’s not scalable – and that’s where an AI agent comes in. Based on historical trends and performance data, advertisers can optimize their campaigns in real time, which saves them money and increases ROI. Recruiters on LinkedIn can now automate routine tasks like finding and following up with candidates, and scheduling interviews. Source According to LinkedIn, recruiters report spending around 20 hours a week on these tasks, and these AI agents can cut that time by half – at least. While I haven’t had the chance to (read: the guts to) ride in a Waymo, Google’s robotaxi, I can tell you a bit about how it works. To operate safely, Waymo vehicles must rely on AI systems to perceive their surroundings, understand other drivers’ behaviors, control the vehicle, and make safe driving decisions. It relies on real-time and historical data to guide and adapt its actions. Tesla’s AutoPilot feature is another example of an AI agent at work. The stock market is unpredictable. Imagine if you had an AI agent tracking it during pre- and open market hours to recommend strategies? Beyond recommendations, consumers and businesses alike are beginning to leverage AI agents to make trades based on their own risk profiles and investment strategies. U.S. hospitals and healthcare orgs, like Mayo Clinic, are piloting the use of AI agents for a series of administrative tasks, including: “For some years now, we‘ve collected mountains of data in EHRs and data lakes but struggled to translate those insights into meaningful impact. Too often, it’s added more burden to clinicians instead of relieving it," said the executive director for Atlantic Health System, an org overseeing over 550 medical care sites, to Becker’s Health It. The next time you get a fraud alert notification from your bank, you’ve likely got an AI agent to thank. (Or rather the team who configured it.) In the banking space, AI agents monitor users’ transaction activity and track spending habits. When they flag behaviors that fall outside of routine, they’ll respond by freezing cards, alerting users, and requesting transaction approvals. BMW is one of many companies using AI-powered robots to streamline production lines. They operate through a series of complex AI systems that assign them tasks and program them to adjust their behavior based on historical data. Alongside humans, production lines function much more smoothly, allowing workers to focus on higher-impact tasks that require human oversight. As you can now see, AI agents are working all around us.

Title: Google ignored Android XR at GDC 2025, and indie VR devs are concerned

One Quest gaming dev told us that "Google is treading the same path towards failure" as Stadia and Daydream by shutting smaller devs out. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Google made no effort to reach out to indie VR and XR game developers at GDC 2025. Combined with social media reports that most top-selling Quest devs were "rejected" from Google's Android XR boot camps, it's painting a worrying picture about what to expect from Android-based headsets like Project Moohan. Google loves GDC; it has a huge presence there every year. This year, its panel on real-world AI applications in game development filled up 45 minutes before it started. It had several Android gaming panels and a large Play Store exhibition in the West hall, and it partnered with Samsung on another Galaxy panel. GDC is well-known for its private hotel demos off the show floor. Perhaps Google made an Android XR push behind closed doors with larger VR publishers. But Google's decision not to court indie VR devs publicly with panels or demos — at the same conference where Meta pushed its new passthrough tech and reassured devs how profitable their store is — seems pretty telling. It's all but guaranteed that the Google I/O 2025 program in May will have workshops on Android XR — to court 2D app devs. Gaming rarely comes up at I/O, and this platform is public, so it's not as though Google needs to wait for some big reveal. Will Google have the same disdainful approach to VR gaming that Apple does with the Apple Vision Pro? At least one VR gaming dev we spoke to thinks that Android XR is already heading in the wrong direction by spurning the people who made Quest headsets so popular. The Quest Store is flooded with meme games, social multiplayer targeting teens, and indie content you'd typically see on Steam. It turns off many VR elites and frustrates VR devs making "serious" content, but these games strike a chord and keep people returning to the Quest 3S headsets more regularly to spend money. Get the latest news from Android Central, your trusted companion in the world of Android Android XR is compatible with Unity, OpenXR, and WebXR, with controller support built into the UI. During our press preview, they suggested that headsets like Samsung's Project Moohan "support gaming use cases." They said that "hopefully" this universal compatibility "will lead to incentives for people to port over to Android." You'd think the owner of the Play Store would recognize the power of smaller developers to strike it big and reach out to those developers to give Android XR greater visibility. Instead, according to developer RJ White at Soaring Roc Studio, "9/10 top devs for the Quest platform" have been rejected from Android XR coding boot camps, and he sees this as a premature death knell for the platform. I've seen 9/10 top devs for the Quest platform rejected for @GoogleARVR's bootcamps for Android XR now. I'm talking about devs / people with games that were in the top 5 top selling. Google is so quick to repeat their mistakes from Daydream, see y'all on @killedbygoogle soon pic.twitter.com/JOH2AJ7gwiFebruary 20, 2025 "Google is treading the same path towards failure that they did with Stadia and Daydream. By shutting out some of the most experienced and smaller studios and developers, they're showing they've learned zero lessons with how to manage or grow a modern software platform," said White in a discussion with Android Central senior editor Nick Sutrich. White, whose indie studio has made several Quest titles like Spiders and FireZone, says that studios and games from "humble origins" power huge successes from major platforms. However, he believes Google is "too focused on trying to force a polished diamond out of a large team as quickly as possible" instead of "cultivating an environment that lets those smaller teams thrive and carve a gem out on their own." "XR developers aren't just game developers; they're 3D interaction experts," says White. However, by rejecting them and prioritizing the same "just make things flat" approach as Apple, Android XR will be "2D dependent to a fault." White's thoughts don't prove Android XR is bound to fail, and we don't have evidence that Google is fully ignoring Quest developers beyond word of mouth. Rather, it reflects a perspective among some VR developers that without overtures from Google, it's hard to know how much stock to put into Android XR — or whether Google knows what it needs to do to make it successful. Big Tech wants to make productivity XR headsets the new alternative to laptops, but none of the big-name consumer products have sold at a massive scale. Apple allegedly sold 500,000 Vision Pros, and Samsung wants to sell 100,000 Moohan headsets. VR gaming remains the one definitive use case that has attracted millions of users. So, is there a reason why Google wouldn't prioritize it? Samsung's Project Infinity headset is rumored to have Sony-made micro-OLED displays with 13.64 million pixels per eye, arriving in the second half of 2025 with a hefty price tag. Beyond that, other announced Android XR devices include a Sony enterprise headset that'll cost almost $5,000, Xreal AR glasses, and an unconfirmed Lynx XR headset that may trend toward the pricey side. So perhaps Google wants to focus its outreach to the enterprise and productivity app creators because it knows people won't spend thousands of dollars to play Gorilla Tag when the Quest 3 is already here. It needs a "killer app" to justify its existence, and Google must assume that app won't be a game. Maybe Google truly believes that gaming developers don't need an Android XR boot camp because they can easily port over OpenXR games without much effort. Perhaps, as White suggests, they're underestimating these XR developers' ability to do more than gaming software and create useful 3D app content, whether for headsets or AR glasses. We know Android XR will have similar camera tech to the Quest's new passthrough API, but Google didn't come to GDC to appeal to XR devs as Meta did. Or maybe Google is following the lead of its hardware partners, who don't care as much about gaming. If Samsung decides to make a Quest rival, then Google could prioritize gaming, right? Frankly, whatever Google's reasoning, I'm not a fan of Google potentially downplaying the importance of gaming for the future of Android XR. It should be building up momentum now so that devs are ready to overload Project Moohan with content by the end of the year. Hopefully, by Google I/O in May, VR gaming devs will have more reason for optimism that Android XR is a viable new platform for them.

Title: Five Critical Indicators To Gauge Recession Risk

Time Published: 2025-03-23T11:00:00Z

ByBill Stone ByBill Stone Contributor. The decline in stock prices combined with plunging consumer sentiment and uncertainty surrounding ... More tariffs has uncreased uncertainty about future economic growth. Since stock prices ultimately depend on earnings, the pace of economic growth is crucial input to future stock performance. After briefly hitting correction territory in the previous week, which is defined as a 10% decline from an earlier high, stocks had a modest rebound last week. The S&P 500 sits 7.6% below its mid-February high. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has faired worse with a drubbing of 18.5% since mid-December. The pressure on stocks stems from an economic growth scare and policy uncertainty surrounding tariffs. Market Returns With the S&P 500 closing over 10% below its February 19 high on Thursday, March 13, stocks officially entered a correction. In the twenty-one U.S. stock market corrections since 1980, the average return in the 12 months following was 13.4%, which on the surface would lead to significant optimism regarding future returns. If the data is sorted between periods when the U.S. economy entered recession within those 12 months after the correction, the results are less compelling at a 1.9% average gain. Of course, if an economic downturn is avoided, the results have been spectacular on average at 19.1%. Average Stock Returns After S&P 500 Correction The strong bond between avoiding recession and better returns following a stock correction makes monitoring the economy's health even more critical. Economists' consensus estimate of 2025 economic growth has dipped slightly to 2.2%, nowhere near recessionary levels. Unfortunately, economists have a poor track record of accurately predicting economic growth with enough lead time, and consensus estimates tend to lag behind real-time data. Consensus U.S. Economic Growth Forecasts Economic models attempting to forecast the current quarter of GDP growth were developed to address the challenges associated with consensus estimates. These estimates adapt to the most recent economic releases to predict growth. This methodology has its challenges but adds additional color to the economic backdrop. The Atlanta Fed model points to a contraction in economic activity in the first quarter, which is probably overstated because much of that downward estimate comes from a marked increase in imports to avoid future tariffs. The St. Louis Fed’s model remains in positive territory. The forecast difference between the two is vast for their first-quarter GDP estimate. After last week's Federal Reserve meeting, the committee noted that “uncertainty around the economy outlook has increased.” Estimated Frist-Quarter U.S. Economic Growth While accurately forecasting an economic downturn in advance with any accuracy is exceptionally challenging, monitoring some high-frequency data can help get an early warning about increased recession risks. These indicators were chosen because they are updated weekly or daily and have shown a strong correlation with economic activity. Indeed, other indicators are crucial, but they are typically only available monthly, sometimes with a significant time lag. The labor market is probably the most crucial part of the economy since consumer spending eventually wanes without wages to fund the purchases. Initial claims for unemployment benefits are reported weekly, but the four-week moving average of claims is used here to reduce volatility. While initial claims are above the lows, the level is not exhibiting a strong uptrend or at a level consistent with economic woes. Initial Jobless Claims The other weekly job data is ongoing claims for unemployment benefits, which are also off its lows and show a slow uptrend. This indicates that it is taking longer for those losing their jobs to find a new one. Remember that the number of employees in the U.S. has more than doubled since 1970, so even though the current roster of those receiving unemployment benefits is as high as it was during the 1969-1970 recession, the numbers aren’t comparable. The bottom line is that the labor market is softening but has not yet reached recessionary levels. Continuing Claims The corporate bond market should undoubtedly be part of the mosaic to monitor the economy’s health. Baa corporate bond data has a long history and arguably provides a look at the “typical” credit quality of companies, as Baa credit rating is the lowest level of investment-grade bonds. The spread is the yield investors demand beyond U.S. Treasury bond rates to compensate for the default risk from buying corporate bonds. These spreads expand when investors worry that more bond defaults could be on the horizon, typically driven by deteriorating economic conditions. While the spreads on Baa corporate debt are above recent lows, the increase seems insufficient to trigger substantial fear of any impending economic downturn. Corporate Bond Spreads The Chicago Fed produces the National Financial Conditions Index weekly. It looks at 105 measures across three categories, risk, credit, and leverage, to create a measure of financial conditions. According to the Chicago Fed, “Positive values of the NFCI have been historically associated with tighter-than-average financial conditions, while negative values have been historically associated with looser-than-average financial conditions.” The chart shows that these periods of tighter-than-normal financial conditions have often been associated with recession. Like the previous measures, financial conditions have worsened but remain below warning levels. Financial Conditions The more economically sensitive cyclical stocks have recently been underperforming the less economically sensitive defensive stocks. This suggests that an economic growth scare is one cause of the recent stock weakness. While it should continue to be monitored, the relative weakness of cyclical stocks has improved off its most recent lows and isn’t at the level seen before past recessions. Performance Of Cyclical Stocks The 10-year Treasury minus 2-year yield is probably the most well-known predictor of recession. Historically, when the yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury falls below the 2-year yield, also called yield curve inverting, a recession is coming. Since the 1970s, a yield curve inversion has occurred before every recession. The only blemishes on its record are the 1998 and mid-2022 inversions, which produced no subsequent economic recessions. The U.S. economy did see a significant slowdown in the first half of 2022 but rebounded in the second half. Unfortunately, even when the signal is correct, it has variable lead and lag times. The yield curve still has a better prediction track record than the economists and is used in about every Federal Reserve model, so it is worth watching despite its warts. The curve is not currently inverted, so this model forecasts no recession. The Yield Curve & Recessions The economic calendar releases for the week are not of the highest importance. The two most notable are February durable goods orders on Wednesday and personal income and spending on Friday. Last week, the Federal Reserve left its projected rate cuts at two but increased the inflation and unemployment forecasts. In addition, the median forecast for GDP growth was lowered. Markets saw this as a somewhat dovish signal and pushed expectations closer to three cuts for 2025, with the first in June. Number Of Fed Rate Cuts Expected Correctly forecasting a recession is challenging in the best of times, but the post-COVID-19 period, with its irregular economic cycles, makes it even more perilous. These high-frequency indicators should provide a reasonable early warning system for a sizable economic contraction. Currently, the odds point to an economic slowdown rather than a recession, which bodes well for reasonable returns from the correction bottom. As always, there are no easy calls when it comes to forecasting the short-term movement of stocks or the economy, especially in a period of increased uncertainty around the severity of the tariffs. For example, though most are rightly concerned about the downside risk from tariffs, there is an upside if somehow this pressure results in better trade terms for U.S. companies. There is always uncertainty. So, investors should have a portfolio with enough cash and bonds to cover short-term expenses. This cushion can help moderate the impact of stock declines on a portfolio and allow one to withstand the inevitable stock declines to experience the benefits of long-term ownership. Within the stock portion, focus should be paid to companies that can weather economic dislocations and perhaps even take advantage of them, regardless of their stock price movement.

Title: Trump Wants to Boost Crypto ‘Stablecoins’ (Which Are Far From Stable)

By Mark Hays President Donald Trump’s recent cockamamie proposal to create a strategic cryptocurrency reserve has been the big crypto news, and not without good reason: It’s an illogical idea, has already caused a small crypto bubble featuring insider trading, and appears to be a quid pro quo for crypto political donors. Even some crypto enthusiasts think it’s a bad idea and a waste of taxpayer money. But the crypto industry has been laser-focused on something more significant: A bill that was voted out of the Senate Banking Committee earlier this month would greenlight a class of crypto assets known as “stablecoins.” Normalizing stablecoins into the fabric of the financial system is critical to broader acceptance of crypto and the crypto casino by banks and other financial firms. Trump appeared to endorse the legislation on Thursday in a video address to the Digital Asset Summit 2025, saying that he has “called on Congress to pass landmark legislation creating simple, common-sense rules for stablecoins and market structure.” If this weak bill becomes law and legitimizes these not-so-stable-coins, the next crypto crash could be far more calamitous for crypto enthusiasts as well as the real economy. What, you might ask, is a stablecoin? Well, most cryptocurrencies lack tangible underlying value, making them highly speculative — people will pay whatever they think other people are willing to pay for them. This makes them infamously volatile and not especially useful to make transactions or as a replacement for money. It’s hard to pay for a loaf of bread, a gallon of milk, or a stick of butter if your crypto token is worth one dollar now, one cent an hour later, or ten cents the hour after that. Enter stablecoins. These cryptocurrencies are assigned a consistent price tied to (or pegged to) an existing currency (such as the U.S. dollar), and they are backed by a reserve of collateral assets that theoretically can repay investors quickly. People buy stablecoins from an issuer with the promise that their price will stay stable and that they can sell them back to (or redeem them with) the issuer at any time, in full, at their stated price, because the issuer has enough collateral assets on hand to pay them back. Editor’s picks The 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time The 250 Greatest Albums of the 21st Century So Far The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time The 200 Greatest Singers of All Time Stablecoins are largely used for crypto investing, like poker chips in a casino. You use your regular money to buy chips to play roulette, then cash out your winnings with the house when you’re done. Crypto investors use stablecoins to buy and sell far more volatile cryptocurrencies. Using stablecoins for these purchases can have lower transaction or conversion fees than using cash. Most crypto investors use stablecoins as a pool of relatively stable, liquid assets more easily available for crypto investing. But the holy grail of stablecoin promoters is using them for payments. Boosters want stablecoins to replace your debit or credit card as a tool for buying ordinary goods and services, claiming blockchain technology will make that whole process faster and cheaper. In some countries with highly volatile currency and clunky payment systems, some people use stablecoins for cross-border transactions. But in the United States, it is far easier to use your card; the idea we would convert our paychecks to stablecoins to buy groceries is a bit laughable. Which means the only practical use for stablecoins is gambling on crypto. But there’s truly nothing new under the sun. Stablecoins resemble two existing financial products — bank deposits and money market mutual funds. Banks hold your money, keep records of your account transactions, and give you your money on demand, which theoretically stablecoin issuers also do. And money market mutual funds are used as a slush fund for other investments, like stablecoins are for crypto speculation.

The history of banking includes bank runs and failures, including in recent years — even with safety and soundness regulations and deposit insurance. And runs on money market mutual funds helped amplify the 2008 financial crisis. Investors had lots of money parked in what they assumed were safe accounts. But, when big firms like Lehman Brothers failed, investors rushed to cash out, fueling the stock market meltdown that reverberated throughout the financial system. Stablecoins have already exhibited these same problems that have left investors in the lurch without any guardrails. Stablecoins frequently become unhooked from their pegged value and many of them lack reliable reserves so that people can get their money out promptly. In fact, a study by international economists that looked at 60 different stablecoins found that they all had lost their peg at least once. Meaning they are anything but stable. Terraform Lab’s Terra/Luna stablecoin, an esoteric algorithmic stablecoin backed by little more than fancy computer code, was touted by crypto bros as a revolution in finance and was a darling of crypto venture capitalists. But it was a fraudulent house of cards. When Terra’s delicate algorithm began to melt down, investors bailed and Terra collapsed, triggering the 2022 crypto crash. The episode revealed that Big Crypto is just like Big Wall Street, where a handful of deeply intertwined firms can rapidly spread financial contagion. When one collapsed, the others soon followed. Tether is the number one issuer of stablecoins, and it is seen as a kind of central bank of crypto that props up global crypto trading. But Tether has already settled with the New York Attorney General and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to resolve claims it misled investors about whether it had enough reserves to cover its coins, and failed to complete audits of its reserve assets. It’s also increasingly the stablecoin of choice for money launderers. Even Circle, considered a more serious U.S.-based stablecoin issuer, became unhitched from its price peg in 2023 when the crypto friendly Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) collapsed. $3.3 billion of Circle’s allegedly safe reserves were held in uninsured deposits at SVB. Had federal regulators not quickly stepped in and spent billions to keep Circle and SVB depositors whole, the entire crypto industry could have imploded. Right now, these stablecoins have almost no federal oversight even though they behave like some pretty ordinary and regulated financial products. So, enacting some regulations for these sketchy things sounds good, right? Not so fast. The Senate proposal has been largely crafted by industry and would essentially allow stablecoin issuers to have their cake and eat it too. It would give stablecoins many of the privileges associated with banking, but fewer of the same responsibilities. For example, the bill would not require stablecoin issuers to get private deposit insurance or have truly stable and robust reserves. Regulators would have little ability to look under the hood, and stablecoin issuers could seek out states with light-touch regulatory regimes to approve their coins. But the bill’s greatest risk is that it would allow Big Tech platforms like Amazon, Meta, or X to become stablecoin issuers. Congress has long prohibited non-financial firms from becoming banks because the combination of commerce and banking is a recipe for disaster. Company-owned banks have incentives to make imprudent investments in their affiliates, and if the affiliate stumbles, the bank can go down with it. But this bill ignores that firewall almost entirely. A Big Tech-issued stablecoin would be company scrip for the 21st century. An Amazon with Bezos Bucks would be not only the dominant retailer of goods, but also a de facto bank, issuing its own currency and holding deposits for millions of customers. It could control access, surveil transactions, manipulate the pricing of goods, and the price of its bespoke money. Or, if X printed Musk Bucks, it could cut off access on a political whim. And if either company went under due to a supply chain crisis or bad management, the collapse could wipe out people’s stablecoin accounts and crater the real economy. In 2019, when Meta (then Facebook) proposed its own Libra stablecoin, there was bipartisan opposition that ultimately tanked the idea. Today, stablecoin backers include both Republicans and Democrats like Senator Gillibrand. What’s changed is that the crypto industry has poured a gusher of money onto a now sycophantic Congress. They have installed crypto hucksters in the White House and in federal financial agencies. Trump has embraced the industry, saying the U.S. will be the crypto capital of the world and creating his own crypto meme coin, while his family operates their own crypto exchange. This week, he called on Congress to pass stablecoin legislation during a taped address to a crypto trade group summit. Now the cryptocrats have their best chance to enshrine their anti-government and self-interested ideas into federal law. This is all part and parcel of Elon Musk and his so-called Department of Government Efficiency’s assault on the federal government, including trying to dismantle the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and defang banking regulators (just as Musk launches his own financial services platform).

Stablecoins are really only good for gambling in crypto markets, and this bill is the lynchpin to exposing the entire financial system to the crypto casino. The crypto bros are high fiving over soaring crypto prices now, but once the banks and financial firms are exposed to not only the booms but also the busts, the real economy will be put at greater risk. In 2022, the crypto industry lost over $2 trillion in value. But your bank probably didn’t go under because it wasn’t up to its neck in crypto. But this stablecoin bill — and likely worse bills to follow — could change that, if we’re all suddenly exposed to the risk, fraud, and instability this industry represents. We want to hear it.

Title: The SEC Resets Its Crypto Relationship

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is looking to reset its relationship with the crypto industry, even before a permanent chair is confirmed by Congress. The latest effort was Friday's roundtable, hosted at the SEC's headquarters in Washington, D.C. and featuring a dozen attorneys representing different views and positions within the crypto industry. You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government. Click here to sign up for future editions. The SEC's reset began when Acting Chair Mark Uyeda launched a crypto task force and oversaw his agency withdraw Staff Accounting Bulletin 121, drop a number of ongoing lawsuits, pause a few more and publish multiple staff statements about how the agency might look at memecoins and proof-of-work mining. The SEC is arguably the most important federal regulator in crypto at the moment. While its sister agency, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, may be the regulator that might one day oversee crypto spot markets, right now it's the SEC that most companies in the sector look to for guidance on what, exactly, it is they can do. The roundtable was split into two portions (three, if you count introductory remarks from the three commissioners): A roughly 90-minute moderated panel discussion, led by former SEC Commissioner and Paredes Strategies founder Troy Paredes, and a 90-minute town hall still moderated by Paredes but featuring questions from the general public. You can read CoinDesk's coverage of the panel discussion at this link. Though the central question during the discussion was — as it has been for years — when and how exactly is a crypto or crypto transaction a security, panelists touched on everything from the role of crypto in boosting ransomware to how exactly companies should operate. Chris Brummer, the CEO of Bluprynt and professor at Georgetown Law, opened up the discussion with his analysis of what the Howey Test actually means: We're basically saying when you have savings, there's an issue of investor protection. The common enterprise prong that we're all familiar with is really addressing a kind of providing problem." "It really just goes to information asymmetries, and then the question of profits goes to investor psychology, greed and fear, the kinds of things that can distort decision-making," he said. "And basically, when you have all those factors together, you have a mandated disclosure [rule]." The SEC's approach thus far has limited a number of crypto projects, Delphi Ventures General Counsel Sarah Brennan said. While many crypto projects are intended to have a broad initial distribution, "the specter of the applications of securities laws" means many projects act more like they'll go public than actually embrace the crypto aspects of their projects. "We see more and more the token is the product … there's different ways that people are artificially supporting price and it's generally been, I'd say, sort of toxic to the market," she said. John Reed Stark, a former SEC attorney, said that the "economic reality of the transaction" is critical. "However you want to look at it, the people buying crypto are not collectors," he said. "We all know that they're investors, and the mission of the SEC is to protect investors." It remains to be seen how the SEC's efforts will continue, but the agency is taking a more active role in publicly engaging with these questions and the industry seems to be responding. The SEC auditorium was about three-quarters full at times, to say nothing of anyone who tuned into the livestream.
