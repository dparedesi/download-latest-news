AI Stat Padding Google and Meta love bragging about how widely their AI tools are being used by consumers. But are those metrics legit? For example, Mark Zuckerberg noted during Meta’s quarterly earnings in October that “more than one billion monthly actives already use Meta AI.” Wow! Sounds like a lot. Usage has also increased, Zuckerberg added, as the underlying models improve. But guess what? The basic search function on Instagram was recently replaced by Meta AI, and the app’s entire user base now defaults to that experience even if someone doesn’t want to use the feature. Meanwhile, Google is funneling people to its AI Mode for search regardless of their search engine preferences. As noted by Search Engine Roundtable, anyone who uploads a photo or document to Google is now sent to AI Mode by default instead of a traditional Google Search or Image Search. Meanwhile, in September, Google quietly began sliding a button into the Chrome URL address bar that directs queries straight into AI Mode rather than traditional search. The Defrayed Desk It’s been knives out for The Trade Desk’s 20% take rate all year. And now the largest independent DSP actually appears open to cutting its own fees. Although The Trade Desk historically has been inflexible in pricing negotiations, it’s offering agency discounts and incentives this Q4, Digiday reports. What’s changed? Mainly, increased competition from other top DSPs, Amazon in particular. Amazon DSP has been courting agencies with 0% tech fees for Amazon-owned media and 1% fees for third-party ads. Plus, TTD is under pressure to meet or exceed expectations this Q4, after missing its fourth quarter 2024 revenue guidance earlier this year. One indie agency buyer says TTD offered 1% to 2% discounts on ad tech fees for individual clients – if the agency committed to spending $500,000 more in Q4 than originally budgeted. Another buyer says they were offered post-auction discounts if they spent at least $750,000 in Q4. At the holding company level, one buyer says, TTD is making its development team available for working on tailored programmatic solutions free of charge. Another observes that TTD’s account reps are more responsive lately. All told, evidence is accumulating of an increasingly cutthroat DSP market. Open Up The Elsagates Good news: YouTube has finally found a reliable audience for the AI-generated content that’s been flooding the platform. Bad news: It’s toddlers (again). YouTube creators are increasingly monetizing by generating generic, low-quality AI slop videos intended for children, reports Bloomberg. The trend is particularly popular among entrepreneur-focused creators that make content about making money on YouTube, such as Monique Hinton and Isabella Kotsias. Both have posted videos specifically advocating that their viewers attempt to copy popular YouTube Kids trends and products, like “Baby Shark” and “Cocomelon.” This might trigger alarm bells for those who remember 2017’s Elsagate, a YouTube epoch marked by nonsensical videos of popular children’s characters (mostly Spider-Man and Elsa from “Frozen”) engaging in strange or disturbing activities. This “luridly-colored vomit,” as Forbes called it at the time, became enough of a problem that YouTube changed its community guidelines, purged thousands of videos and removed monetizable ads from millions more. Although, some might argue that these content farms didn’t disappear so much as move into new genres. But Wait! There’s More Let’s get real about agentic AI.

December 03, 2025 17:29 ET | Source: Orezone Gold Corporation Orezone Gold Corporation VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Dec. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Orezone Gold Corporation (TSX: ORE | ASX: ORE | OTCQX: ORZCF) (the “Company” or “Orezone”) is pleased to report shallow, high-grade confirmatory grade control drill results from the P17 Zone at its flagship Bomboré Gold Mine. The P17 Zone is a high-grade hard rock deposit outcropping at surface located at the southern end of the Bomboré mining lease. In addition to several phased oxide pits, which have locally been advanced into the hard rock, the P17 Zone will be a primary mill feed source in 2026 for the new hard rock plant, currently being commissioned. Selected Drill Highlights1: Patrick Downey, President and CEO stated, “The results of the near-surface P17 Zone grade control drill program were successful in confirming the P17 resource and reserve models. Furthermore, the results serve to underscore the high-grade nature and overall continuity of mineralization within the P17 Zone. This initial grade control drill program is centered on the first six months of planned production from the P17 Zone. Mining activities in this area of the pit are now underway, with mined ore scheduled to be fed to the mill in early 2026 once commissioning is complete. ___________________________________1. True widths of mineralization are between 75-80% of drilled lengths. Commissioning of the stage 1 hard rock plant is well advanced, with the jaw crusher now commissioned and a crushed ore stockpile established. The SAG mill is now turning, with grinding media being added and first ore through the mill expected to follow very soon. Water testing of the CIL circuit is now complete, with the tanks to be filled and fresh carbon to be added by the end of the week. Overall, commissioning activities remain on schedule, with first gold expected in the coming days. This is truly an exciting time for the Company, and I want to thank everyone involved for all their hard work and dedication. The commencement of production from the stage 1 hard rock plant represents a major milestone for Orezone, with overall gold production at Bomboré set to increase by 45% to 170,000 to 185,000oz in 2026. This will mark a significant cash flow inflection point, underscored by the Company’s solid balance sheet and record high gold prices.” Figure 1: Stage 1 Hard Rock Expansion Commissioning Figure 2: Bomboré Plan Map – Highlighting Location of P17 Grade Control Drilling and Associated Sections Figure 3: P17 Composite Long Section – Highlighting Location of Grade Control Cross Sections and Further Exploration Upside Down Plunge of US$1,740/oz Pit Shell (Looking West) Figure 4: P17 Grade Control Cross Section A-A’ (Looking North) Figure 5: P17 Grade Control Cross Section B-B’ (Looking North) Table 1: P17 Grade Control Drill Results * Mineralized intervals are reported as downhole lengths.

Title: This Meta Quest 3 charging dock won't stop beeping at me, but damn does it keep my VR setup neat and tidy

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The PrismXR charging dock is certainly one of the neatest stands for the Quest 3 you'll find on the shelves. It keeps things low-profile, charges the headset and its controllers, and doesn't take up much room on a shelf or desk. But there are some definite annoyances that prevent this from being an easy recommendation. Charges the controllers and the headset Supplies rechargeable batteries for the controllers Neat, tidy look while on display Handy indicator LEDs to show how much each element is charged Compatible with headstraps from other brands Annoying, incessant beeping Doesn't seem to turn itself off when the headset is fully charged Separate version for the Quest 3S -Not the fastest method of charging Why you can trust GamesRadar+ Our experts review games, movies and tech over countless hours, so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about our reviews policy. Pretty soon after setting up my Quest 3, I realised how quickly the controllers lose battery. In fact, even if I didn't use them or the headset for a week or two, I'd frequently come back to find them completely drained. Having only used a charging stand that gave power to the headset itself, I knew my budget for batteries would thank me if I tried something that charged the controllers too. So, to the best Meta Quest accessories I turned, and of all the available charging stands, PrismXR's filled the most gaps in the market for me. It charges the headset and the controllers, but also feels perfect for anyone who wants a pretty low-profile way of displaying their VR loadout. It doesn't have fancy RGB or stand too high for a lot of shelfing units, and its aesthetic matches the Quest 3's as though it was made by Meta itself. For $69.99 / £69.99, it's roughly on par with the cost of most other charging docks, so let's see how it performs. Having just reviewed the PrismXR charging belt for Quest 3 and 3S, I had high hopes for this dock as a follow-up. Just like the charging belt, this is fairly self-explanatory. The Carina D1 is a dock that you can plug in via USB-C that'll magnetically charge your headset and controllers. Rather annoyingly, because this was designed with the Meta Quest 3 in mind before the 3S arrived on the scene, it has a fairly snug design that's bespoke for the original VR headset. For that reason, you'll need to opt for a separate version of this device for the Quest 3S, which leaves the door open for wrong purchases, but does help to create a neater match with whichever headset you own. From a quick search of both charging docks on Amazon and at PrismXR's own website, they seem to do the exact same thing, and for the most part, are the same price. That said, I'd think about looking into the price history of either at your own leisure because, like any and all Quest 3 accessories, their prices fluctuate madly. To keep the controllers charged, the D1 dock comes with rechargeable batteries, as well as different grip plates for your controllers so that they can attach magnetically. These feel exactly the same as the stock ones when using the controllers during VR play, and only take a minute to swap out. Weekly digests, tales from the communities you love, and more Magnetics are the name of the game here, as magnetic charging pins are used to connect the bottom of the headset to the charging dock. For the overall aesthetic of the Carina D1, this helps to keep things nice and neat - there are no cables to be seen from the front. Perhaps my favorite thing about the dock's design is that it has a handy head strap pedestal at the back, which allows for more compatibility with third-party accessories. I was worried my KIWI Design Comfort Battery Strap wouldn't fit, but thanks to this handy add-on, I had no problems. In terms of technicals, the Carina D1 Charging Dock can Fast Charge up to 27W, which PrismXR says will take your Quest 3 from 0% to 50% in 45 minutes, and fully charge in 1hr50. The controllers have a quoted charging time of 2hr30. There are also some handy LED indicators on the front of the stand that tell you what level of battery the headset and two controllers are, and as I'll come on to, there are audible indicating bleeps too. I really like the look of the PrismXR charging dock. Its nest design means I was spoiled for choice for where to put it in my living space. It could fit in one of the shelves in my cube unit because it isn't too tall. It's not obnoxiously wide, so it can sit nicely with the other gaming hardware on my desk or a shelf. But at the same time, it still looks neat and tidy, and its white design lines up exactly with the color of the headset. The only real test of this dock, besides its looks, is how it charges the headset and controllers. If I'm honest, I'd like it to be a bit quicker, but that's mainly because I'm used to plugging it in at the wall with a super-fast charger and seeing it juice up pretty speedily. Arguably, for a charging stand, I don't think it necessarily needs to be super quick because it's where you put it when you know it'll be sitting to rest between sessions. Still, I found it took around an hour to charge the headset up to its 50% mark while the controllers were also connected - which I suppose matches up with the quoted 45-minute mark that I'll assume refers to just the headset being connected. The times when I've used this charging stand and haven't been faced with annoying bleeps fill me with more confidence that this isn't an issue you'll definitely run into At least the indicating LEDs are a handy way to keep tabs on charging progress. What isn't so handy is a very loud beeping tone that the D1 will pierce your eardrums with. When you first connect the headset and controllers, it'll beep. When it finishes charging them? It'll beep, and sometimes, keep beeping. I've seen reports of these bleeps being buggy and incessant for multiple users. Certainly, the first time I used the D1, that's the experience I had when my headset reached full charge. Other reports seem to suggest that the beeping is due to a faulty connection, which would line up with my experience of other times when the headset reached full charge, then didn't beep at all. Either way, these beeps are loud and a very annoying point of convenience-gone-wrong if they continually bug out for people. What's more unclear is whether or not the dock can turn itself off when the Quest 3 reaches full charge, because if not, it could cause you battery life issues further down the road. Unless you go and unplug the dock entirely or remove the headset so the magnetic pins aren't connected, it could keep charging your headset, or, in my case, beeping loudly. The times when I've used this charging stand and haven't been faced with annoying bleeps fill me with more confidence that this isn't an issue you'll definitely run into, but since this is a known issue for other users who have had larger connection problems, it's all a little unclear. Considering this brand's charging belt will turn itself off when it detects a fully charged headset, it's a bit of a shame that the charging dock isn't more upfront that it will do so as well. If you touch the LEDs, they'll go to sleep, but I'm not sure whether that actually turns the charging power off. Thankfully, I've found that my headset will still sit fine on the dock when it's just out of place enough that the pins aren't touching. This isn't ideal though, and goes against the snug aesthetic the charging stand is going for. Irritating beeping aside, I do think this charging stand is one of the better and more versatile ones available for the Quest 3. PrismXR has made something that's well designed and caters to a large cross-section of VR gamers who have lots of storage needs and headstraps already integrated into their setups. It's a shame that the charging isn't quicker, and there's definite friction with those indicating bleeps - which seem to be the most frequently reported issue in most customer reviews. Regardless, this is a charging stand I'll be keeping in my loadout, mainly thanks to its convenience of charging the headset along with its controllers, which can prove tricky otherwise. I integrated the PrismXR Carina D1 Charging Dock into my gaming setup for a number of weeks before this review was written. Since receiving the testing sample from PrismXR, it's been my main method of charging my VR headset and controllers. To put it to the test, I set a timer on how long it took to charge the headset in various scenarios: when it was at 0%, when it was at 50% going to 100%, and a full charge. I compared my experience to my time spent with other Quest 3 accessories. For more on how we test the latest gadgets, check out the GamesRadar+ hardware policy. Happy with flat screen games for now?

Michael Burry warns the U.S. stock market could face a crash worse than 2000. He says AI and tech stock valuations are dangerously inflated. Over half of U.S. equities are in passive funds, leaving few active investors to stabilize the market. Nvidia, Palantir, and AI-heavy firms could see sharp sell-offs. Accounting tricks, like stretched depreciation on hardware, hide real risks. Burry has closed his hedge fund and taken bearish positions personally.

PPC Trends is back for its eighth edition, bringing together top industry experts to share field-tested insights on how to stay visible, maintain control, and drive performance in increasingly AI-first ad ecosystems. Reserve your seat to see where your brand stands in the 2026 AI search race. 2026 marks the beginning of the “Agentic Era,” where AI stops just consuming the web and starts writing to it. Previous predictions: 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 This is my 8th time publishing annual predictions. As always, the goal is not to be right but to practice thinking. For example, in 2018, I predicted “Niche communities will be discovered as a great channel for growth” and “Email marketing will return” in 2019. It took another 6 years. That same year, I also wrote “Smart speakers will become a viable user-acquisition channel in 2018”. Well… Boost your skills with Growth Memo’s weekly expert insights. Subscribe for free! For the past three years, we have lived in the “generative era,” where AI could read the internet and summarize it for us. 2026 marks the beginning of the “agentic era,” where AI stops just consuming the web and starts writing to it – a shift from information retrieval to task execution. This isn’t just a feature update; it is a fundamental restructuring of the digital economy. The web is bifurcating into two distinct layers: A big question mark is advertising, where Google’s expansion of ads into AI Mode and ChatGPT showing ads to free users could alleviate pressure on CPCs, but AI Overviews (AIOs) could drive them up. 2026 could be a year of wild price swings where smart teams (your “holistic pods”) move budget daily between Google (high cost/high intent) and ChatGPT (low cost/discovery) to exploit the spread. It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent; it is the one most adaptable to change. — Leon C. Megginso Prediction: I forecast an “Extinction Event” in Q3 2026 for the standalone AI visibility tracking category. Rather than a simple consolidation, our analysis shows the majority of pure-play tracking startups might fold or sell for parts as their 2025 funding runways expire simultaneously without the revenue growth to justify Series B rounds. Why: Context: Consequences: Prediction: It’ll be harder for spammers to influence AI visibility in 2026 with link spam, mass-generated AI content, and cloaking. By 2026, agents will likely use Multi-Source Corroboration to eliminate this asymmetry. Why: Context: Consequences: Prediction: AI Overviews (AIOs) scale to 75% of keywords for big sites. AI Mode rolls out to 10-20% of queries. Why: Context: Consequences: Prediction: By 2026, “identity spoofing” will become the single largest cybersecurity risk for public companies. We move from, Is this content real? to Is this source verified? Why: Context: Consequences: Prediction: OpenAI shifts to a hybrid pricing model in 2026: An “ad-supported free tier” and “credit-based pro tier.” Why: Context: Consequences: Prediction: Perplexity will be acquired in late 2026 for $25-$30 billion. After its user growth plateaus at ~50 million MAU, the “unit economics wall” forces a sale to a giant that needs its technology (real-time RAG), not its business model. Why: Context: Consequences: Prediction: Nvidia stock will correct by >20% in 2026 as its largest customers successfully shift 15-20% of their workloads to custom internal silicon. This causes a P/E compression from ~45x to ~30x as the market realizes Nvidia is no longer a monopoly, but a “competitor” in a commoditized market. (Not investment advice!)

Reserve your seat to see where your brand stands in the 2026 AI search race. Maximize ad profit. Stop wasting budget on weak pages. Learn the strategic landing page audit process to boost your conversion rates. Your campaigns are only as strong as the pages they lead to. You can have the most targeted ads, the sharpest copy, and a budget that makes your CFO nervous. But if your landing page doesn’t deliver on what the ad promised, you’re leaving money on the table and feeding poor signals back into your campaign algorithms. Landing pages are where intent meets experience. When they align, conversion rates increase. When they don’t, even high-quality traffic bounces, and your cost-per-acquisition (CPA) spirals upward. This post walks through the core elements of a high-performing landing page strategy. This strategy is one that not only converts visitors, but also strengthens your ad campaigns. Whether you’re running Google Ads or Meta campaigns, these landing page strategies apply. Most advertisers focus heavily on the ad itself: the creative, the targeting, the bid strategy. That makes sense. But the landing page is where the actual conversion happens. It’s the final step in the funnel, and it has a direct impact on campaign performance. Here’s why landing page audits should be a regular part of your paid media workflow: When more visitors convert, your cost per conversion drops. That gives you more room to scale or reinvest budget into other channels. Platforms like Google and Meta rely on conversion data to optimize your campaigns. If your landing page isn’t converting, the algorithm receives weak or misleading signals, which limits its ability to find high-intent users. Google rewards landing pages that are relevant, fast, and user-friendly. A higher quality score can lower your cost-per-click (CPC) and improve ad placement. In short, your landing page isn’t just a conversion tool. It’s a feedback loop that shapes how well your campaigns perform over time. The first rule of landing page optimization is simple: Match the message. If your ad promises “free shipping on running shoes,” your landing page should immediately confirm that offer. If the ad targets “B2B marketing automation tools,” the page should speak directly to that audience and use case. Message match builds trust. When a visitor clicks an ad and lands on a page that looks, feels, and sounds different, they bounce. Fast. Here’s how to ensure relevance: The fewer mental leaps a visitor has to make, the more likely they are to convert. Your call-to-action (CTA) is the most important element on the page. It’s where intent turns into action. But too many landing pages bury the CTA, use vague language, or overwhelm visitors with multiple competing actions. That creates friction and kills conversions. Here’s how to get CTAs right: Your CTA should feel like the natural next step, not a sales pitch. Zoho CRM’s website is an excellent example of a landing page leveraging these points: Specific offer: The header “Get started with your 15-day free trial” is highly specific, clarifying the duration and type of offer, addressing the vagueness of a simple “Get Started.” Visual contrast: The primary CTA button, “GET STARTED,” is a high-contrast, bright red that immediately draws the eye away from the surrounding white and blue elements. Action-oriented copy: While the button copy is “GET STARTED,” the text immediately below it clarifies the action as a free trial sign-up, maintaining clarity. Furthermore, the page limits distractions, focusing the user on the single action of signing up for the trial. This approach effectively guides the user toward the intended conversion. Visuals aren’t just decoration. They communicate value, build trust, and guide the visitor’s attention. The right images can make your offer feel tangible and desirable. The wrong ones create confusion or undermine credibility. Here’s what works: Strong visuals support your copy. They don’t compete with it. Superside’s landing page demonstrates using a portfolio of images to support the message that they can handle diverse creative needs for clients across different industries: Show the outcome: Instead of a single generic image, the page prominently features a collage of actual client deliverables (app interfaces, product packaging, social media graphics) for brands like Amazon, Reddit, and Zapier. This directly illustrates the quality and range of the service’s outcome. Communicate value and trust: By showing recognized brand logos and diverse project types, the imagery instantly builds credibility and reinforces the claim that they can “Scale your in-house creative team with top global talent.” Avoid clutter (in context): While it’s a collage, the consistent presentation style and the grouping of images in a grid are purposefully designed to communicate a broad portfolio quickly, which directly reinforces the main headline: “Your creative team’s creative team.” This strategy uses visuals to provide immediate, tangible proof of the service’s capability. Your landing page needs to answer one critical question: Why should I choose you over the competition? This is where you articulate your unique value proposition (UVP). It’s not just about listing features. It’s about showing how your product or service solves a specific problem better than the alternatives. Here’s how to communicate your UVP effectively: Your UVP should be immediately visible, ideally above the fold. If a visitor has to scroll to understand what you’re offering, you’ve already lost some of them. Social proof reduces risk. It shows visitors that other people (ideally, people like them) have chosen your product or service and been satisfied. But not all social proof is created equal. The key is to use a mix of formats and place them strategically throughout the page. Here are the most effective types of social proof to look for when you are doing a landing page audit: Short, specific quotes from real customers carry more weight than generic praise. Include the customer’s name, title, and company (if B2B) to increase credibility. “We increased conversions by 30%” is more compelling than “Great service!” Quantifiable outcomes resonate, especially with data-driven buyers. If well-known brands use your product, feature their logos. Recognition builds instant trust. Aggregate ratings (e.g., “4.8/5 stars from 1,200+ customers”) provide quick validation. Link to third-party review sites like G2, Trustpilot, or Capterra for added credibility. Security seals, industry certifications, and compliance badges (e.g., SOC 2, GDPR) that are visible on landing pages reassure visitors that their data is safe. Place social proof near your CTA. That’s where hesitation peaks, and reassurance matters most. The Reddit Ads landing page demonstrates the effective use of logos of recognizable clients or partners to build instant trust and social proof: Client credibility: At the bottom of the page, a prominent line on the landing page reads, “Trusted businesses across all industries and sizes use Reddit Ads to meet their goals.” This statement is immediately backed up by a scrolling horizontal display of recognizable brand logos, including Mars, GameStop, Capital One, and Maybelline. Instant trust: For a potential advertiser, seeing global, established brands using the platform reduces the perceived risk of signing up. If major companies trust Reddit Ads with their budget, a new user can be reassured the platform is legitimate and effective. Strategic placement: The logo section is placed below the main registration form and the tool to explore audience, providing reinforcement just before a user might scroll away or hesitate. It offers a final, compelling piece of proof that supports the core message of reaching a “niche audience.” This visual list of successful clients serves as powerful validation for the service. A beautiful landing page means anything if it doesn’t load quickly or breaks on mobile devices. Technical performance directly impacts conversion rates and campaign quality scores. Google prioritizes fast, mobile-friendly pages, and visitors abandon slow-loading sites within seconds, noting that 53% of visits are likely to be abandoned if pages take longer than three seconds to load. Here’s what to audit: Technical problems aren’t just annoying. They cost you conversions and damage your campaign performance. Where you place your CTA matters just as much as what it says. Most landing pages include a primary CTA above the fold, and that’s a really good start. But high-converting pages use multiple CTAs placed at natural decision points throughout the page. Here’s a strategic approach: Each CTA should feel contextual, not pushy. It should align with where the visitor is in their journey down the page. Your landing page isn’t just a conversion tool. It’s a data generator. Every click, scroll, and form submission sends signals back to your ad platform. These signals teach the algorithm which audiences convert, which creatives work, and how to allocate budget more efficiently. When your landing page converts well, those signals are strong and accurate. The algorithm learns faster and optimizes better. When your landing page underperforms, the data becomes noisy. The algorithm struggles to find patterns, and your campaigns stagnate. This is why landing page audits are essential. A small improvement in conversion rate doesn’t just boost revenue. It improves the quality of data feeding back into your campaigns, creating a compounding effect over time. Start by identifying your lowest-performing landing pages. Run A/B tests on headlines, CTAs, and imagery. Measure the impact not just on conversions, but on downstream metrics like CPA, return on ad spend (ROAS), and customer lifetime value (LTV). The better your landing pages perform, the smarter your campaigns become.

Title: DeFi markets are finally pricing fundamentals — but only after months, new study shows

About us Copy link A version of this article appeared in our The Decentralised newsletter on December 2. Sign up here. Hey all, Liam here. Decentralised finance has a reputation for pulling projects’ valuations out of thin air, but new research suggests those values aren’t just a fugazi. Greenfield, a Berlin-based venture firm, argues that three key metrics provide far more explanatory power for why valuations move in any direction than any other variable. By closely tracking the fees a protocol generates, its total value locked, and its revenue, Greenfield concludes that investors can typically make better bets on which projects will succeed. What’s more, a model that uses these indicators typically outperforms analytical models that track Bitcoin and Ethereum performance, as well as models that incorporate social sentiment, such as followers on X. This thesis holds at three and six-month horizons. Most importantly, however, it shows that the so-called fundamentals narrative that’s been kicking around X this year is much more than a meme. “The longer you give the market to play out, the more you actually see that there is a divergent performance based on fundamentals versus just everything being correlated to broader market moves,” Felix Machart, a partner at Greenfield and the paper’s co-author, told DL News. It’s not a silver bullet, of course. Investors also need to be aware of temporary spikes in activity related to token incentives, as well as a product’s defensibility amid mounting competition. And fickle social sentiment can create a noisy investing landscape, at least in the short term. Over one month, for example, fundamental measures offer less explanatory power for valuations than the model that tracks the price of Bitcoin and Ether alone, according to Greenfield’s analysis. The analysts also highlight the importance of a token’s volume on decentralised exchanges, active users, daily transactions, and a protocol’s treasury value as additional metrics, albeit with less explanatory power. For those outside of the crypto space, the analysis seems pretty intuitive. A company’s stock will typically rise if it experiences higher revenues quarter after quarter. So, why shouldn’t DeFi protocols? For one, protocols aren’t companies. Their decentralised nature and how they create investor value can differ. Machart says, for instance, that one can consider token buybacks and yield from staking as revenue, since value accrues to token holders regardless. DeFi protocols are also far younger than traditional capital markets. Greenfield’s analysis, spanning 2021 to 2025, isn’t the final word on the matter, either. Far from it. The report ends with additional research questions to expand the data set used, incorporate even more onchain analytics, and extend the timeline for measuring the thesis. Still, the analysis is meaningful — especially as institutional investors begin tiptoeing into the sector. “It just proves that you can invest based on an expectation of future fundamentals playing out,” Machart said. “Market outcomes are not just random and purely hype driven.” “We actually can see trends that show the market is maturing.” Liam Kelly is DL News’ Berlin-based DeFi correspondent.

Title: Criteo CEO Michael Komasinski on agentic commerce, experiments with LLMs, and M&A rumors

Save 50% on a 3-month Digiday+ membership. Ends Dec 5. In early 2025, Criteo entered a new chapter, with its current CEO, Michael Komasinski, taking the reins as the fourth chief executive of the company in its 20-year history — a sign that investors expect bold strategic recalibration for the Nasdaq-listed outfit. That transition comes amid a turbulent backdrop: over the last several years, its share price and market cap have fluctuated amid speculation over “signal-loss,” albeit Google’s U-turn on its earlier plans for Chrome augured well in Komasinski’s time in office, not to mention the disruptive emergence of AI. In response, Criteo has attempted to rebrand itself from a heavy-hitting retargeting outfit to a commerce media platform that’s now experimenting with LLMs, publishers, and retailers alike to hone monetization in the AI-first era. Komasinski sat down with Digiday to discuss these efforts on the sidelines of a recent press event, explaining his strategy as he approaches his one-year anniversary in office. The conversation below has been edited for brevity and clarity. I think there are two tracks in terms of how it changes things. The first is the self-service… we will launch Commerce Go as a self-service tool by the end of Q1 next year. That means an advertiser can go online, put in their credit card information, and have campaigns up and running in 10 minutes. It is competitive with some of the self-service tools from Meta with Advantage+ or from Google with Performance Max –the differentiation versus those platforms is that it’s cross-channel. Criteo has always had a healthy amount of managed service that was required to drive the platform, and I see that changing quite a bit over the next couple of years. The second track around agentic with retail, that really is an extension of what we do today — the ability to power sponsored ads or improved relevancy for a retailer — that’s just an extension of capabilities that we serve on product detail pages currently. Nothing to disclose on revenue models or forecasts yet, but it is exciting. One of the reasons it is exciting is that it leverages existing infrastructure, so we don’t have to reinvent the way crawling monetization is resolved. It’s using the RTB pipes that the BidSwitch is built on, and for mid-to-longtail publishers, which is a segment that’s like really underserved in the LLM free-for-all that’s going on. So, we’re encouraged by the pilot with RTB, and looking to find other publishing partners to do further testing with, then we’ll start to refine that monetization model, and hopefully that will turn out to be a viable product for mid-to-longtail publishers and us. When you’re a publicly traded company, right, you are always looking for ways to maximize value for shareholders. But no, we’re not in a process of any kind today; the redomiciling of the parent-level entity is really designed to improve our ability to attract passive capital to our shares and to improve trading liquidity. It doesn’t really change the operations of the business. Our tech team is still based in Paris, as are many of our back office functions, and we don’t see any changes to that. So it should help the stock become more easily included in passive indices like ETFs, which should be good for our shareholders. I don’t have anything firm to say on that, other than, again, as a publicly traded company, you always have a responsibility to look at your portfolio of assets and to make sure that everything’s a good fit for the strategy that you’re pursuing. As we continue to make progress with the whole set, commerce media is the north star, and all of the different segments are laddering up to that pretty well, but it is a responsible thing to always be looking at your portfolio. We are excited about it, but I think the reason we don’t talk more about it is that the test isn’t complete yet. There’s testing that’s happening over the course of this month, so we don’t want to get ahead of that, although I’m pretty confident that the test results will be positive. When you’re dealing with a third party that you’re dependent on, it’s not about what you think; it’s about what they want to do, but I think the results show an uplift in relevancy. It’s up to them as to what they want to do with that. Is that something they want to pay for, or is that something that shapes how they think about native ad units powered by intelligence?

Title: Trump DOJ Sides With Roundup Manufacturer Over Cancer Victims in Supreme Court Case

To donate by check, phone, or other method, see our More Ways to Give page. Daily news & progressive opinion—funded by the people, not the corporations—delivered straight to your inbox. Bottles of Roundup weed and grass killer are stacked at a Costco Wholesale store on March 11, 2025, in San Diego, California. An attorney at Food & Water Watch said the DOJ sent a "clear message... to sick Americans harmed by toxic pesticides: Trump has Bayer’s back, not theirs." The Trump administration is pushing for the US Supreme Court to shield the manufacturer of Roundup from thousands of state lawsuits alleging that its widely used herbicide product causes cancer. On Monday, US Solicitor General D. John Sauer recommended that the high court agree to hear a challenge to a Missouri jury's verdict in 2023 that awarded $1.25 million to a man named John Durnell, who claimed that the product caused him to develop non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Bayer, the agribusiness giant that purchased the manufacturer of Roundup, the agribusiness giant Monsanto, in 2018, immediately challenged the verdict. In 2015, the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup, as "probably carcinogenic to humans" based on "limited evidence." That evidence became less limited in 2019, when a prominent meta-analysis by a team of environmental health researchers found that people exposed to glyphosate at the highest levels had a 41% higher risk of developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma than those who weren't. There are nearly 4,500 Roundup claims currently pending in federal court, and at least 24 cases have gone to trial since October 2023. They make up just a fraction of the more than 170,000 claims filed. According to Bloomberg, Bayer has already been forced to pay out more than $10 billion in verdicts and settlements over the product, which has caused a massive drain on the company's stock price. In what it said was an effort to “manage litigation risk and not because of any safety concerns,” Bayer removed glyphosate-based herbicides from the residential market in 2023, switching to formulas that “rely on alternative active ingredients.” That didn't stop the lawsuits from coming. Durnell's victory was the first successful case brought against Bayer outside California, the only state that labels the product as carcinogenic. That in Missouri opened the floodgates in other states, and plaintiffs subsequently won sizable payouts in Georgia and Pennsylvania. But now the Trump administration is trying to help the company skirt further accountability. Sauer, who is tasked with arguing for the government in nearly every Supreme Court case, filed a 24-page brief stating that there is a lack of clarity on whether states have the authority to determine whether Bayer and Monsanto violated the law by failing to warn customers about potential cancer risks from Roundup. Bayer argues that these cases are preempted by the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), which forbids states from enacting labeling requirements more stringent than those recommended by the federal government. Sauer agreed with Bayer, stating in the brief that the US Environmental Protection Agency "has repeatedly determined that glyphosate is not likely to be carcinogenic in humans, and the agency has repeatedly approved Roundup labels that did not contain cancer warnings." In 2016 and again in 2020, the EPA indeed classified glyphosate as "not likely to be carcinogenic to humans" following agency assessments. However, in 2022, the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals voided this assessment, finding that the agency applied “inconsistent reasoning” in its review of the science. Among the justifications for the ruling were that the EPA relied heavily on unpublished, non-peer-reviewed studies submitted to regulators by Monsanto and other companies that manufacture glyphosate. The agency also largely disregarded findings from animal studies included by the IARC, which showed a strong link between glyphosate and cancer. "The World Health Organization has recognized glyphosate as a probable carcinogen while the EPA continues to twist itself into pretzels to come to the opposite conclusion," Lori Ann Burd, a staff attorney and director of the Center for Biological Diversity's environmental health program, told Common Dreams. Notably, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. built his national profile campaigning against the dangers of pesticides and railing against regulatory capture by big business. Kennedy served as an attorney for Dewayne Johnson, the first plaintiff to win damages against Monsanto in 2018, where a jury determined that Roundup had contributed to his cancer. "If my life were a Superman comic, Monsanto would be my Lex Luthor," Kennedy said in a 2020 Facebook post. "I've seen this company as the enemy of every admirable American value." During Kennedy's 2024 presidential run, he pledged to "ban the worst agricultural chemicals already banned in other countries." But after he was sworn in as President Donald Trump's HHS Secretary, he began to sing a different tune. As Investigate Midwest noted, his "Make America Healthy Again" commission's introductory report made no mention of glyphosate. Meanwhile, he reassured the pesticide industry that it had nothing to worry about: "There’s a million farmers who rely on glyphosate. 100% of corn in this country relies on glyphosate. We are not going to do anything to jeopardize that business model," he said during a Senate Appropriations Committee hearing. The Trump EPA has deregulated toxic chemicals across the board over the past year. It rolled back protections against per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), often referred to as "forever chemicals," in drinking water, which have many documented health risks. It has also declined to ban the widely used insecticide chlorpyrifos, which has been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders in children. Elizabeth Kucinich, the former director of policy at the Center for Food Safety, described the US Department of Justice's effort to shield Bayer as another "betrayal of MAHA health promises." Her husband, the two-time Democratic presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich, worked as the campaign manager for RFK Jr.'s 2024 presidential bid. “This is regulatory capture, not public protection,” she said. “This action shields chemical manufacturers from accountability by elevating a captured federal regulatory process over the lived harm of real people. That is anti-life, and it is exactly what millions of MAHA voters believed they were voting against.” Food & Water Watch staff attorney Dani Replogle said the DOJ filing "encourages the Supreme Court to slam judiciary doors in the faces of cancer patients across the country." "No political posturing can undo the clear message this brief sends to sick Americans harmed by toxic pesticides," she continued. "Trump has Bayer’s back, not theirs." The Trump administration is pushing for the US Supreme Court to shield the manufacturer of Roundup from thousands of state lawsuits alleging that its widely used herbicide product causes cancer. On Monday, US Solicitor General D. John Sauer recommended that the high court agree to hear a challenge to a Missouri jury's verdict in 2023 that awarded $1.25 million to a man named John Durnell, who claimed that the product caused him to develop non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Bayer, the agribusiness giant that purchased the manufacturer of Roundup, the agribusiness giant Monsanto, in 2018, immediately challenged the verdict. In 2015, the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup, as "probably carcinogenic to humans" based on "limited evidence." That evidence became less limited in 2019, when a prominent meta-analysis by a team of environmental health researchers found that people exposed to glyphosate at the highest levels had a 41% higher risk of developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma than those who weren't.

Title: Audio language model startup Gradium raises $70M to create more realistic voice AI systems

UPDATED 07:00 EST / DECEMBER 02 2025 by Mike Wheatley Audio artificial intelligence startup Gradium is launching today after closing on an impressive $70 million seed funding round, just three months after it was founded. The startup is backed by investors that include FirstMark Capital and Eurazeo, which led the funding round, as well as DST Global Partners, Korelya Capital and Amplify Partners, and high-profile angels such as former Google LLC Chief Executive Eric Schmidt. Gradium’s mission is to commercialize audio language models, which are specialized AI systems that are designed to process, understand and generate natural language using audio-text data. Natural language is leveraged as a “supervision signal,” allowing ALMs to perform tasks such as audio classification and speech synthesis more effectively than general-purpose large language models. The startup says ALMs are the “audio-native counterpart” to LLMs and are meant to support more natural and expressive voice interactions with dramatically lower latency, making conversations with AI feel more realistic. The concept was first developed by Gradium’s founders during their time at Kyutai, a nonprofit AI research lab. ALMs are trained on datasets that pair audio with descriptive text, enabling them to learn the complex relationships between sound and language. The natural language supervision technique replaces traditional labeling, using natural speech as a guiding signal to teach them how to understand and say specific words. Co-founder and Chief Executive Neil Zeghidour explained that his company wants to help ALMs lock the true potential of “voice AI,” which is still reliant on what he says are subpar systems. “Existing systems are brittle, costly and unable to deliver truly natural interactions,” he said. “Our goal is to make voice the primary interface between humans and machines.” According to Zeghidour, ALMs can outperform LLMs in any kind of voice AI task, including areas such as speech recognition, where spoken language is transformed into written text, as well as audio generation, such as creating original speech, and audio classification, which refers to identifying and categorizing different audio signals. Ultimately, Gradium wants to transform the capabilities of AI assistants and agents, making conversational interactions between them and humans feel more natural and realistic. “To achieve this, we’re eliminating the longstanding tradeoff between quality and scalability: combining ultra-realistic expressivity, accurate transcription and ultra-low-latency interactions at a price point that finally makes high-quality voice ubiquitous,” Zeghidour said. Zeghidour has assembled a talented team to make good on this promise, comprised of researchers and engineers who previously worked at Google’s DeepMind, Meta Platforms Inc.’s FAIR research team and Jane Street Capital LLC. He said the company possesses one of the industry’s highest concentrations of generative audio expertise assembled so far, and it has already developed a number of production-ready systems that are being used by early adopters and generating revenue. Those early adopters include companies in gaming, customer care, language learning, healthcare and AI agents. Gradium is launching its platform and enabling access to its first models today, with support for English, French, German, Spanish and Portuguese. It says it offers flexible plans catering to the smallest developer teams all the way up to the largest enterprises. The startup said it will continue its ongoing collaboration with Kyutai, ensuring it has access to the latest frontier research in generative audio so it can remain at the forefront of the latest innovations in ALMs. Support our mission to keep content open and free by engaging with theCUBE community.

Title: Here's why everyone's talking about a 'K-shaped' economy
URL: https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/12/01/k-shaped-economy/
Time Published: 2025-12-01T21:00:04Z

By CHRISTOPHER RUGABER, AP Economics Writer WASHINGTON (AP) — From corporate executives to Wall Street analysts to Federal Reserve officials, references to the “K-shaped economy” are rapidly proliferating. So what does it mean? Simply put, the upper part of the K refers to higher-income Americans seeing their incomes and wealth rise while the bottom part points to lower-income households struggling with weaker income gains and steep prices. A big reason the term is popping up so often is that it helps explain an unusually muddy and convoluted period for the U.S. economy. Growth appears solid, yet hiring is sluggish and the unemployment rate has ticked up. Overall consumer spending is still rising, but Americans are less confident. AI-related data center construction is soaring while factories are laying off workers and home sales are weak. And the stock market still hovers near record highs even as wage growth is slowing. It also captures ongoing concerns around affordability, which is much more of a concern for middle and lower-income households. Persistent inflation has received renewed political attention after voter anger over costly rents, groceries, and imported goods helped Democrats win several high-profile elections last month. “Those at the bottom are living with the cumulative impacts of price inflation,” said Peter Atwater, an economics professor at William & Mary in Virginia. “At the same time, those at the top are benefiting from the cumulative impact of asset inflation.” Here are some things to know about the K-shaped economy: Atwater actually popularized the label “K-shaped economy” during the pandemic after seeing it crop up on social media. Other economists were discussing different letters to describe how the COVID recession in 2020 could play out: Would it be a V-shaped recovery, meaning a sharp decline and then rapid bounce-back? Or would it be U-shaped, meaning a more gradual rebound? Or, worse, L-shaped: A recession followed by extended stagnation. “There was sort of this land-grab for letters,” Atwater said. “To me the letter that made the most sense was K.” Back then, it captured the differing fortunes between white-collar professionals still employed and working at home while stock prices rose, even as massive layoffs at factories, restaurants, and entertainment venues pushed unemployment to nearly 15%. Inequality was somewhat reversed in the aftermath of the pandemic, when businesses offered large raises for blue collar workers as the economy reopened and demand surged. Many companies — restaurants, hotels, entertainment venues — were caught short-staffed and sought to rapidly increase hiring. Lower-income workers saw larger pay gains than higher-paid ones. In 2023 and 2024, inflation-adjusted wages for the bottom quarter of workers rose at a yearly rate of 3.9%, outpacing the 3.1% gains for the top quarter, according to research by the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. “We had that kind of two-year period where the bottom was catching up and that talk of the K-shape went away,” Dario Perkins, an economist at TSLombard, said. “And since then, the economy’s cooled down again,” he added, bringing back K-shape references. This year, however, inflation-adjusted wage growth has weakened as hiring has fallen, with the drop more pronounced for lower-income Americans. Their wage growth has plunged to an annual rate of just 1.5%, the Minneapolis Fed found, below that of the highest earning quarter of workers at 2.4%. Slower income growth has left many lower-income workers less able to spend. Based on data from its credit card and debit card customers, Bank of America found that spending among higher-income households rose 2.7% in October compared with a year ago, while lower-income groups lagged at just 0.7%. And a Federal Reserve Bank of Boston study in August found that consumer spending in recent years has been driven by richer households, while lower- and middle-income Americans have piled up more credit card debt even as they’ve spent less. Corporate executives are paying attention and in some cases explicitly adjusting their businesses to account for it. They are seeking ways to sell more high-priced items to the wealthy while also reducing package sizes and taking other steps to target struggling consumers. Henrique Braun, chief operating officer at Coca-Cola, for example, said in late October that the company is pursuing both “affordability” and “premiumization.” It is generating more of its earnings from higher-end products such as its Smartwater and Fairlife filtered milk brands, while at the same time introducing mini cans for those looking to spend less. “We continue to see divergency in spending between the income groups,” Braun said in a conference call with analysts last month. “The pressure on middle and low-end income consumers is still there.” Sales of first- and business-class tickets have been fueling revenue and profit for Delta Air Lines, its CEO Ed Bastian said in October, while lower-end consumers have been “clearly struggling.” And Best Buy CEO Corie Barry on Tuesday said that the top 40% of all U.S. consumers are driving two-thirds of all consumption. The remaining 60% are focused on getting the best deals and are more dependent on a healthy job market, she said. “One of the things we’re watching closely is how does employment continue to evolve for particularly that cohort of people who are living more paycheck to paycheck,” she added. The massive investment in data centers and computing power has also contributed to the K-shaped economy, by lifting share prices for the so-called “Magnificent 7” companies competing to build out AI Infrastructure. Yet so far it’s not creating many jobs or lifting incomes for those who don’t own stocks. “What we see at the very top is an economy that is sort of self-contained … between AI, the stock market, the experiences of the wealthy,” Atwater said. “And it’s largely contained. It doesn’t flow through to the bottom.” Driven by big gains for companies like Google, Amazon, Nvidia, and Microsoft, the stock market has risen nearly 15% this year. But the wealthiest 10% of Americans own roughly 87% of the stock market, according to Federal Reserve data. The poorest 50% own just 1.1%. Many economists worry that an economy propelled mostly by the wealthiest isn’t sustainable. Perkins notes that should layoffs worsen and unemployment rise, middle- and lower-income Americans could pull back sharply on spending. Revenue for companies like Apple and Amazon would fall. Advertising revenue, which is fueling companies such as Google and Facebook parent Meta, typically plunges in downturns. Such a cycle could even force the “Mag 7” to pull back on their AI investments and send the economy into recession, he said. “Then you’re talking about the bottom of the K essentially pulling down the top,” he added. Perkins, however, sees a different path as more likely: Many U.S. households will receive larger tax refunds early next year under the Trump administration’s budget law. And Trump will likely appoint a new Federal Reserve chair by next May who will be more inclined to cut interest rates. Lower borrowing costs could accelerate growth and wages, though it could also worsen inflation. AP Retail Writer Anne D’Innocenzio in New York contributed to this report.

Title: Here’s why everyone’s talking about a ‘K-shaped’ economy

By CHRISTOPHER RUGABER, AP Economics Writer WASHINGTON (AP) — From corporate executives to Wall Street analysts to Federal Reserve officials, references to the “K-shaped economy” are rapidly proliferating. So what does it mean? Simply put, the upper part of the K refers to higher-income Americans seeing their incomes and wealth rise while the bottom part points to lower-income households struggling with weaker income gains and steep prices. A big reason the term is popping up so often is that it helps explain an unusually muddy and convoluted period for the U.S. economy. Growth appears solid, yet hiring is sluggish and the unemployment rate has ticked up. Overall consumer spending is still rising, but Americans are less confident. AI-related data center construction is soaring while factories are laying off workers and home sales are weak. And the stock market still hovers near record highs even as wage growth is slowing. It also captures ongoing concerns around affordability, which is much more of a concern for middle and lower-income households. Persistent inflation has received renewed political attention after voter anger over costly rents, groceries, and imported goods helped Democrats win several high-profile elections last month. “Those at the bottom are living with the cumulative impacts of price inflation,” said Peter Atwater, an economics professor at William & Mary in Virginia. “At the same time, those at the top are benefiting from the cumulative impact of asset inflation.” Here are some things to know about the K-shaped economy: Atwater actually popularized the label “K-shaped economy” during the pandemic after seeing it crop up on social media. Other economists were discussing different letters to describe how the COVID recession in 2020 could play out: Would it be a V-shaped recovery, meaning a sharp decline and then rapid bounce-back? Or would it be U-shaped, meaning a more gradual rebound? Or, worse, L-shaped: A recession followed by extended stagnation. “There was sort of this land-grab for letters,” Atwater said. “To me the letter that made the most sense was K.” Back then, it captured the differing fortunes between white-collar professionals still employed and working at home while stock prices rose, even as massive layoffs at factories, restaurants, and entertainment venues pushed unemployment to nearly 15%. Inequality was somewhat reversed in the aftermath of the pandemic, when businesses offered large raises for blue collar workers as the economy reopened and demand surged. Many companies — restaurants, hotels, entertainment venues — were caught short-staffed and sought to rapidly increase hiring. Lower-income workers saw larger pay gains than higher-paid ones. In 2023 and 2024, inflation-adjusted wages for the bottom quarter of workers rose at a yearly rate of 3.9%, outpacing the 3.1% gains for the top quarter, according to research by the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. “We had that kind of two-year period where the bottom was catching up and that talk of the K-shape went away,” Dario Perkins, an economist at TSLombard, said. “And since then, the economy’s cooled down again,” he added, bringing back K-shape references. This year, however, inflation-adjusted wage growth has weakened as hiring has fallen, with the drop more pronounced for lower-income Americans. Their wage growth has plunged to an annual rate of just 1.5%, the Minneapolis Fed found, below that of the highest earning quarter of workers at 2.4%. Slower income growth has left many lower-income workers less able to spend. Based on data from its credit card and debit card customers, Bank of America found that spending among higher-income households rose 2.7% in October compared with a year ago, while lower-income groups lagged at just 0.7%. And a Federal Reserve Bank of Boston study in August found that consumer spending in recent years has been driven by richer households, while lower- and middle-income Americans have piled up more credit card debt even as they’ve spent less. Corporate executives are paying attention and in some cases explicitly adjusting their businesses to account for it. They are seeking ways to sell more high-priced items to the wealthy while also reducing package sizes and taking other steps to target struggling consumers. Henrique Braun, chief operating officer at Coca-Cola, for example, said in late October that the company is pursuing both “affordability” and “premiumization.” It is generating more of its earnings from higher-end products such as its Smartwater and Fairlife filtered milk brands, while at the same time introducing mini cans for those looking to spend less. “We continue to see divergency in spending between the income groups,” Braun said in a conference call with analysts last month. “The pressure on middle and low-end income consumers is still there.” Sales of first- and business-class tickets have been fueling revenue and profit for Delta Air Lines, its CEO Ed Bastian said in October, while lower-end consumers have been “clearly struggling.” And Best Buy CEO Corie Barry on Tuesday said that the top 40% of all U.S. consumers are driving two-thirds of all consumption. The remaining 60% are focused on getting the best deals and are more dependent on a healthy job market, she said. “One of the things we’re watching closely is how does employment continue to evolve for particularly that cohort of people who are living more paycheck to paycheck,” she added. The massive investment in data centers and computing power has also contributed to the K-shaped economy, by lifting share prices for the so-called “Magnificent 7” companies competing to build out AI Infrastructure. Yet so far it’s not creating many jobs or lifting incomes for those who don’t own stocks. “What we see at the very top is an economy that is sort of self-contained … between AI, the stock market, the experiences of the wealthy,” Atwater said. “And it’s largely contained.

Title: The K-shaped economy means inflation hurts at the bottom and swells the assets at the top

Just because Cyber Monday is over doesn't mean you missed out. We've spent the past several days (and nights!) tracking some of the best deals of the year, and while some of the best Cyber Monday sales ended promptly at midnight, we were pleased to see so many of them extending their discounts through this week. Some of the best ongoing deals we've spotted include 30% off a pair of Sony WH-1000XM5 headphones, the best overall headphones we've tested, and 55% off the Dyson V9 Motorbar vacuum. We're also still seeing multiple discounts on Apple smartwatches, including the brand-new Apple Watch SE 3, which is $50 off. And if you're starting to shop for the holidays and looking for something for the kids in your life, several giftable items are on sale, including up to 33% off the classic Razor scooter that you (and your ankles) might remember from your own childhood. Some stores share the details surrounding their promotional periods, while others don't have a specific publicized end date, so we recommend acting now if you see something you're interested in. Keep scrolling to explore some of the best deals still available, including offers on tech, streaming, home, kitchen, beauty, pets, and more. Our whole team has been working around the clock to cover all of this holiday's best deals, but as the editor who keeps a close eye on all categories year-round, I have a few favorite discounts. These are five sales that are especially rare or low, including some products that weren't even on sale during Black Friday or Cyber Monday. — Sarah Saril, Editor, Deals and How to Watch This massive 14-qt. air fryer is equipped to handle large family-sized meals with two racks to cook double the food. It also uniquely has a built-in rotating rotisserie rack to make your own chicken roast. The Magnus Pro has incredibly thoughtful cable management and supportive add-ons that make it a great choice for gamers, streamers, and anyone who uses multiple monitors and accessories. The Switch 2 comes with a range of new features for Nintendo gamers, including enhanced Joy-Con designs, improved performance, and more. This bundle comes with Mario Kart World, one of the console's exclusive titles, so you can get started playing right away. With their celebrity creators, high production value, and intuitive app, MasterClass videos feel more like edutainment than traditional online courses. STARZ offers blockbuster movies and popular original series like Outlander, Party Down, and Power. This deal on the annual plan makes the service incredibly affordable, and even better, it comes with zero ads. There are five deals that I was pleased to see extend past Cyber Monday, ranging from can't-miss streaming service bundles to discounts on beloved hair dryers. A few of these offers will stick around until January, but others will most likely have a more limited lifespan. — Lillian Brown, Senior Associate Editor of Streaming This bundle combines ad-supported Disney Plus and Hulu with ESPN Unlimited, pulling together three massive libraries for one discounted price. This compact massage gun boasts a convenient, travel-friendly design that remains powerful enough to deliver effective results. We also love its heated head, which we've found to speed up recovery. Garmin's Forerunner 165 is a runner's best friend. It offers key features like performance monitoring, personalized training plans, and recovery details. This Nespresso model pairs the brand's centrifugal brewing technology with a small countertop footprint and an elegant profile. Pair it with the bundled Aeroccino frother, and you have a coffeehouse setup at home. It may be pricey, but if you're looking for a high-tech hair dryer that actually lives up to the hype, the Dyson Super Sonic may be for you. We've logged several solid price drops over the past few days, including discounts on headphones, gaming consoles, and smart home tech. You can also still save on electronic services like VPNs (virtual private networks) or cellular providers. The WH-1000XM5 are one of Sony’s top over-ear headphones. They boast excellent noise-canceling performance along with great audio quality and a truckload of convenient features. JLab’s Go Air Pop are the most affordable wireless earbuds that are actually still worth buying. This simple two-channel soundbar is an affordable yet capable audio system. It delivers good stereo separation and Bluetooth support. However, though it's technically capable of Dolby Atmos playback, it lacks the ability to showcase that format properly. Bose’s oil can-sized Portable Smart Speaker offers big sound, wireless charging capability, and compatibility with both Amazon’s and Google’s virtual assistants. It also boasts versatile connectivity options and strong functionality. If you're new to smart lighting, then the Philips Hue Starter Kit is a great place to begin. The Philips Hue light bulbs are easy to use and set up. This kit includes four bulbs and a Hue Bridge, a wireless hub that connects to your router. Mint's Unlimited plan offers unlimited talk, text, and data, now with no data caps. We recommend signing up for this option to maximize your savings, as it's typically the most expensive option in the lineup. Mint Mobile's annual unlimited plan offers unlimited talk and text and truly unlimited high-speed data on T-Mobile's network (subject to deprioritization) for an unrivaled value at $15/month with a limited-time discount. Surfshark's VPN deal is one of the most affordable around and comes with three months extra for free, with prices starting from $1.99 a month. Unlike much of the competition, you can use it on an unlimited number of devices at once. The starter tier is more than enough for most users as it features robust encryption and will unlock international streaming with ease. The middle tier is only a touch more expensive and has extra features like a private search engine, antivirus, breach alerts, and more. NordVPN is one of the top VPN services in the business. It offers excellent value with a strong selection of features and a low monthly price. A wide selection of international servers, high-end security, fast connections, and audited privacy protection have made the brand a household name in the world of VPNs. This new VPN deal drops the per-month price as low as $2.99 on a two-year plan, and you get an additional three months extra for no charge. Looking for an alternative VPN still packed with useful features and servers in over 110 countries? Then ProtonVPN is well worth a look, and it has a sizable discount on its two-year plan. If you'd prefer a shorter-term deal, the one-year plan is great value too and only costs $3.99 a month with the current 60% discount. Both plans can be used across 10 devices at once and feature a great ad-blocker, split tunneling, and more security-conscious features. TVs can get pricey, but these deals can help cut down on some of the costs of enhancing your home theater. We've found sales for some notable models, including gorgeous OLED sets with incredible contrast, wallet-friendly QLED options that still deliver plenty of brightness, and even stylish Frame TVs that double as artwork when they're not in use. Though we think the larger versions of Amazon's Omni QLED TV are overpriced for what you get, the 50-inch model offers an excellent balance between cost and performance. It has handy Alexa features and is one of the only 50-inch TVs available with local dimming, which enables solid contrast performance. The Hisense U8QG impresses with one of the brightest pictures on the market, and pairs that searing luminance with excellent contrast for a dynamic, punchy picture. Samsung's Frame TV is designed to look like a piece of art on your wall thanks to its flush mount, matte screen, and magnetic frame bezels. Its image quality is mediocre, but its style makes it a great pick for design-focused buyers. Walmart's Onn TVs are entry-level displays sold at highly competitive prices. Although their image quality is lacking, they still offer reliable Roku streaming. Onn TVs are decent budget buys if you're looking for an inexpensive set for casual viewing or a secondary room. The Roku Plus Series is the brand's most affordable QLED TV model. This new 2025 edition uses a Mini LED backlight for improved local dimming but it still can't match the HDR brightness capabilities of the step-up Pro Series. If you're looking for a more affordable alternative to Samsung's Frame TV, Hisense's Canvas is a solid option. It has a similar matte screen, slim mount, and bezel system. That said, it lacks the Frame's One Connect Box, and its viewing angles aren't great. TCL's S5 is one of the brand's entry-level 4K TVs. Brightness and contrast are limited compared to pricier models, but the S5 still offers a wide range of colors and has Alexa built-in. The QN90F is one of the few premium QLED TVs made in a 50-inch screen size. It offers a bright image and features Samsung's anti-reflective matte screen, which significantly reduces glare. The S90F is an impressive midrange OLED and one of our favorite new displays of 2025. It gets a bit brighter than last year's S90D and offers better color volume than similar LG OLED models. The 83-inch C5 is a standout midrange OLED TV in this size. It offers an infinite contrast ratio and inky black levels while providing a modest boost in brightness compared to last year's C4 model. Several streaming sales ended with Cyber Monday, but there are still a few stellar offers available. Services with ongoing deals span from family-friendly apps, such as Disney Plus, to more targeted streamers, like Starz. A few of these deals can help you save on up to 12 months of service, a great way to temporarily ward off potential price hikes. This bundle combines ad-supported Disney Plus and Hulu with ESPN Unlimited, pulling together three massive libraries for one discounted price. STARZ offers blockbuster movies and popular original series like Outlander, Party Down, and Power. This deal on the annual plan makes the service incredibly affordable, and even better, it comes with zero ads. The MyEntertainment package offers lifestyle and entertainment-centric channels (plus a few other surprises). Channel offerings include Bravo, FX, TLC, and more. Subscribers also gain access to ad-supported Disney Plus, Hulu, and HBO Max. DirecTV's MySports pack carries popular sports channels, from mainstays like ESPN to niche offerings like the ACC Network. With their celebrity creators, high production value, and intuitive app, MasterClass videos feel more like edutainment than traditional online courses. Gaming gear is often one of the last items to go on sale, and things like PCs and consoles have been particularly pricey lately. But these sales offer a rare opportunity to cash in on some savings. Whether you're eyeing a PS5, a controller, or a new laptop, today's deals bring some of the steepest discounts we've seen in a while. The Switch 2 comes with a range of new features for Nintendo gamers, including enhanced Joy-Con designs, improved performance, and more. This bundle comes with Mario Kart World, one of the console's exclusive titles, so you can get started playing right away. The PS5 Pro has more powerful specifications compared to the standard PS5, enabling enhanced graphical settings and better frame rates on supported games. However, its high price tag will only appeal to big tech enthusiasts who demand the very best performance. Sony's DualSense controller improves on the classic PlayStation design with haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, USB-C, charging, a built-in mic, and a longer battery life. Microsoft’s Xbox wireless controllers already come in a huge variety of colors, but you can also create your own custom controller with the Xbox Design Lab. The online tool will let you or your gift recipient decide how each part of the controller looks, including the buttons and thumbsticks. Pricing starts at just $10 more than a standard Xbox controller, and Microsoft recently opened customization to the premium Xbox Elite controller, which has extra buttons and a rubberized grip. Acer's budget gaming laptops offer a lot of power for a great price. This model includes one of Nvidia's newest GPUs, ensuring smooth performance in nearly any game. The Logitech G305 keeps it simple without compromising incredible performance. It's perfect for gaming, work, or whatever you use it for. The Logitech G502 is an iconic gaming mouse, and offers long battery life and a massive amount of customization. It's a cult favorite model that can hold up for hundreds of gaming sessions. The Razer Basilisk V3 Pro delivers smooth movement, cool RGB lighting, plenty of buttons, and a high-quality design that feels great in-hand. It’s our pick for the best wireless gaming mouse you can buy. The Magnus Pro has incredibly thoughtful cable management and supportive add-ons that make it a great choice for gamers, streamers, and anyone who uses multiple monitors and accessories. The Secretlab Titan Evo excels in every field, offering durability, style, adjustability, and supreme comfort. It's a great time of year to stock up on items that you might not normally think of, including home products that you need to buy anyway. From vacuums to space heaters, these are the best deals to hop on now. Carpet and upholstery cleaners can often be large, bulky contraptions that clutter busy closet floor space. The portable Bissell Little Green Mini is a great option for small spaces like apartments and condos because it's small enough to fit in cupboards, on shelves, or even under your sink. The eufy Omni C20 is more compact, both the robot and its base station, but it doesn’t sacrifice auto-emptying dirt or auto-washing its mop pads. It’s a solid alternative to the growing size of some combo units, at an approachable price point. Dyson's V9 Motorbar has slightly less suction than the V8, but it shares the LCD screen found on higher-end models, which displays cleaning time, power mode, and maintenance alerts. It offers up to 40 minutes of cleaning time and has three cleaning modes. The Shark PowerDetect NeverTouch Pro packs a cleaning punch, vacuuming and mopping with a ferocity few robots can muster. And it does so at a reasonable price. iRobot has managed to offer a budget-level vacuum-only robot with smart home mapping, meaning you can clean certain spaces as you wish and set no-go zones. It uses lidar technology to map your home to maximize coverage and navigate your space. It offers four suction levels. The Solo Stove Bonfire 2.0 is the best fire pit we've tested because its design facilitates blazing fires with minimal smoke. Plus, it's available in seven colors. This cute, vintage-looking Vornado space heater is modeled after the company's original 1945 Vornado fan. It has few bells or whistles, but it's super effective at warming up small-to-medium-sized rooms. The Dyson Bladeless Heater isn't just a great heater and air conditioner — it's beautifully designed, too, so it'll fit well in any room. The Lasko Duo Comfort Heater did the best job of heating our test room. It features intuitive controls and doubles as a tower fan for year-round use. It's also a good time to upgrade your sleep setup, whether you're shopping for a new pillow or looking to take the plunge on a new mattress. Some of our favorite mattresses, beds, and sheets are marked down, including cozy picks from trusted brands like Brooklinen and Leesa — perfect if you've been meaning to refresh your bedroom without overspending. The Leesa Sapira Hybrid Mattress provides great edge support and motion isolation. Its mix of memory foam and pocket springs produces an average firmness, making it an outstanding solution for back pain sufferers of any sleeping style. Save an extra $25 with our exclusive promo code INSIDER25. The Saatva Classic Mattress is designed to suit a variety of sleeping styles and features a plush top for luxurious comfort. Its patented lumbar zone technology helps support proper spine alignment. The gel memory foam of the Nectar makes it a versatile mattress that conforms to the contours of your body to relieve pressure. It's a premium sleep experience, but its price tag is way under a grand. The Bear Hybrid mattress has six layers of foam and spring coils for a customized fit and great night's sleep. It's also made with a moisture-wicking cover, making it a great choice for hot sleepers. The DreamCloud Premier Hybrid Mattress performed well in all of our tests, which makes it ideal for most sleeping types, couples, and people who tend to overheat at night. Also receive a free sleep bundle worth $599 with a mattress purchase that includes pillows, a sheet set, and a mattress protector. Linen is breathable all year round and great for warm sleepers, and Brooklinen's set doesn't disappoint with its immediate softness. The hardcore bundle includes flat and fitted sheets, a duvet cover, and four pillowcases. Brooklinen's Luxe Sateen Core Sheet set is designed with an incredibly smooth feel that gets softer over time. Its tight weave is silky, soft, and versatile for year-round use. The Mellanni Iconic Collection Microfiber sheets are incredibly affordable with solid cooling properties, a wide range of color options, and OEKO-TEX certification. One of the best-selling items across the entirety of Wayfair, this upholstered storage bed uses a hydraulic lift mechanism to reveal ample space for storing extra bedding or off-season clothing. It's available in seven colors. The Silk & Snow Wooden Bed Frame is a reasonably priced bed frame made of sustainable wood that doesn’t require any tools or screws for assembly. You can also add on a headboard design, too. This upholstered wingback platform bed frame oozes sophistication but at a very accessible price point. It's available in five colors and full, queen, and king bed sizes. Couches, desks, coffee tables, and even Christmas trees are among the best furniture deals we've found. Don't miss out on these great savings from Wayfair, Joybird, Flexispot, West Elm, and more. This rich navy faux leather sofa with brass legs looks far more expensive than it really is. Reviewers say it's comfortable and easy to put together. The oversized Wilder Sleeper Sectional is comfortable from day to night. It features a classic pull-out design and a Tempur-foam mattress. This feminine and small-space-friendly writing desk features two storage drawers with reeded diamond fronts and shiny brass florette ring pulls. The soft blue-gray finish works as a unexpected neutral. Flexispot's most premium and heavy-duty offering, the E7 Pro has a powerful motor, greater adjustability, and a semi-C Leg structure for added stability and comes with a 15-year warranty. This mid-century West Elm coffee table is the pinnacle of versatility with built-in storage and a lift-top table for working on a laptop. We love it's mixed materials, with a marble inset top for visual interest. Invest in a piece of iconic Danish design. The Pacha Chair will be right at home in any living room seating arrangement or in a bedroom nook. The oversized low profile design is made for lounging. This sculptural wood console adds textural interest (and necessary storage) to your dining room, entryway, or living room. This classic grey-wash dining set includes four chairs, but the table can extend to comfortably seat up to 8 people. Gorgeously full and lush, the Balsam Hill Fraser Fir Artificial Christmas Tree is one of the most realistic artificial trees you can buy. Cyber Monday served up great deals for anyone who loves to cook, and many of the best discounts are still available. Air fryers, coffee makers, mixers, pot and pan sets, and even outdoor grills are all on sale, offering great savings on trusted brands like Keurig, Nespresso, and Ninja. If you've been thinking about upgrading your kitchen or grilling setup, this is an ideal time to do it for less. This massive 14-qt. air fryer is equipped to handle large family-sized meals with two racks to cook double the food. It also uniquely has a built-in rotating rotisserie rack to make your own chicken roast. A gorgeous aesthetic and available colorways might be what catches your attention, but these pans by Caraway have more to offer. They combine great performance with excellent heat conductivity and ease of cleaning. The set also comes with a smart storage solution. The Ninja Dualbrew Pro offers all the same features and brewing options as the Ninja Specialty, with the addition of an attachment that allows the user to brew coffee from pods. This Nespresso model pairs the brand's centrifugal brewing technology with a small countertop footprint and an elegant profile. Pair it with the bundled Aeroccino frother, and you have a coffeehouse setup at home. Save space, time, and money with Keurig's Express brewer. It's not as narrow as the K-Mini, but it has a strong brew setting and a 42-ounce water tank, making it more practical for couples or small offices. The Technivorm Moccamaster is a premium drip coffee maker from the Netherlands known for its exceptional build quality, precise temperature control, and ability to brew a full pot of coffee that meets Specialty Coffee Association (SCA) standards. It delivers consistently flavorful, well-extracted coffee with a short brew time. The Breville the Barista Express is the best all-in-one, semi-automatic espresso machine you can find. Though newer, more expensive models have been released, this one is still our favorite. With its massive 26-quart size, the Ninja Foodi DT201 10-in-1 XL Pro Air Fry Convection Toaster Oven is one of the largest countertop air fryers you can buy, large enough to fit a 12-pound turkey. The Instant Vortex Plus was the best air fryer in our tests and features a window into the basket to monitor your food. Available in several candy-colored shades with a matte finish, Bella's Fit's Anywhere design is space-saving without compromising on capacity.

The Dreo Aircrisp Pro Air Fryer is the best compact air fryer we tested, making it perfect for single servings of wings and fries. This Traeger model might sound like it's aimed at professionals, but it’s simple enough for anyone to operate. It can be controlled with the spin of a dial or remotely via a mobile app. Best of all, it has 970 square inches of cooking space, so big parties or intimate dinners are both possible. The new Weber E-325 is a great mid-size grill for casual backyard cooks. Our two favorite features are the one-handed ignition and the Flavorizer bars that give the perfect sear. If you're headed into the winter looking to upgrade your home fitness game, you might be interested in some of the helpful sales on everything from trackers to gym equipment. Select deals on rowing machines, massage guns, and Apple Watches are still live. The Apple Watch SE 3 marks the most capable generation of the brand's budget smartwatch yet. It now comes powered by the S10 chip, with better battery life, and more. The Ultra 2 has been replaced by the new Ultra 3, which offers improved battery life and a more powerful processor, yet it remains one of Apple's top-tier smartwatches. If you can find it discounted for less than the Ultra 3, it still offers great value for athletes and adventurers. The Charge 6 boasts a more expansive feature set than the budget-friendly Inspire 3, catering to both fitness amateurs and enthusiasts. While it's a pricier option, it's still an amazing value for such a capable fitness tracker. Garmin's newest watch in the Vivoactive line adds 50 preloaded activity modes, more on-watch running data, and side buttons for better control during workouts. It's a big upgrade over the Vivoactive 5, and is a solid option for those who want a robust fitness watch without the bulk.

The Ergatta Lite Rower offers the brand's game-like rowing experience and beautiful design with a smaller footprint and lower price. It's not too late to pivot your wardrobe for the cooler weather, especially with these deals on apparel and accessories. Some of our favorite brands are still offering sales right now, including discounts from SKIMS, Vuori, Allbirds, and more. This modal slip dress's slinky silhouette is designed to hug and accentuate your curves. It has a flattering square neckline. We haven't found Columbia's coats to be perfectly warm when it dips below freezing, but they're well designed nonetheless. This style comes in plus sizes too. It's made with a water-resistant material to keep you dry. This season, brown is the new black. Wear this warm, fuzzy number under a parka for an extra layer of protection from the cold. With this simple sleek dress it’s all about the hidden details, like a built-in bra and ventilated four-way stretch. The Inversion Rib Support Tank adds a sneaky amount of support without losing its cute factor.

We love Spanx AirEssentals for the breathable fabric, stylish cut, and huge variety of color availability. Equal parts cute and cozy, this half-zip pullover has a flattering, roomy drape. The Classic Ultra Mini Snugscape features a mix of suede and shearling with a modern twist. The Wool Runner 2 introduces design tweaks that make the shoe even more comfortable and durable. That includes increased height and width in the sole cushioning, resulting in a higher profile and more comfort. Whether you're in need of new dress shoes or just some casual layers, these sales have you covered. Some of our favorite brands, like The North Face and Naadam, are still offering notable deals. With DryVent waterproof technology, a 550-fill down power rating, and a faux fur hood, The North Face's Explore Farther Parka is well-equipped for winter. A straightforward 5 mm band like this is ideal for someone who wants an understated, comfortable wedding ring that will never feel out of place. The polished 14k yellow gold adds warmth and shine without any extra embellishment. This versatile layering piece works across the seasons with its breathable fabric and ribbed detailing. It's made of Naadam's premium 16-gauge cashmere for an ultra-fine and silky soft fit that you won't want to take off. There’s a tricky balance to strike when it comes to flannel shirts, neither too heavy nor too light for daily wear. This Bonobos shirt lives up to its title, with an Oxford shirt-like build and ultra-soft fabric made for the office and holiday date nights. The comfort of sweats meets the utility of bungee pants in these warm and fleecy pants. Designed to be moisture-wicking, breathable, and two to three times cooler than regular Cotton, the Cool Cotton Boxer Brief is super comfortable. The Nike Pegasus Trail 5 are versatile shoes that provide a smooth ride, whether running on trails or pavement. Made with leather, these UGGs are an elevated take on a classic silhouette. Makeup fans and skincare lovers are in for a treat, since several major brands are still on sale, including items from Urban Decay, Ulta, and Tarte. You can save on everything from skin serum to makeup. The Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence uses snail mucin to repair and fortify your complexion. If you're going to splash out on a tried-and-true serum that is super-effective and that dermatologists swear by, the Skinceuticals C E Ferulic Serum is it. The Laneige Gentle Gel Cleanser is a lightweight formula, as its name would suggest. It contains Blue Hyaluronic Acid for optimal hydration, allantoin to smooth the skin, and an amino-acid complex to support the skin barrier. The Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask is like a lip balm version of the brand's cult-favorite Water Sleeping Mask. The Tarte Maracuja Lip Plump offers a creamy, smooth-gliding formula similar to a balm or lipstick. It also burns less than other plumpers, with more of a cool, minty-fresh feeling. Your hair deserves better, and with these deals, you can give it just that without breaking the bank. Notably, big-hitters like Dyson and Olaplex are still on sale. It may be pricey, but if you're looking for a high-tech hair dryer that actually lives up to the hype, the Dyson Super Sonic may be for you. The Dyson Supersonic Nural is a feature-packed luxury hairdryer with smart personalization and heat protection that make styling faster and easier. It’s lightweight, ergonomically balanced, and far less tiring to use than traditional dryers. If a high-end hair dryer is within your budget, the Nural’s intelligent design and best-in-class features make it worth the splurge. This updated Airwrap adds Bluetooth features for customizing settings, tracking routines, and even automating curls with a single button.

This tilt-pan AI camera combines pet-focused tracking and alerts with solid home security features, providing pet parents with flexibility, peace of mind, and reliable performance at an affordable price. With the holidays coming up, there are big discounts on toys, board games, and Lego sets with great picks for giftees of all ages. You can get something for the kids in your life or your inner child. These scooters are durable outdoor toys that feel like a big gift yet they're pretty affordable. Because these scooters also fold up, they are easier to store and take on the go than a bike. As a parent, KiwiCo crates give me peace of mind that I'm providing developmentally appropriate activities for my daughter, and my favorite part is that the Panda Crate comes with a magazine full of additional activity ideas. This tiny plant set from Lego is designed for adults to enjoy assembling and then displaying. They're a fun way to display some greenery without worrying about any maintenance. One of Lego's many sets for adults, this 878-piece set lets you create a bonsai tree to decorate any room, minus the upkeep. It includes pieces to add cherry blossoms.

CNET's Scott Stein reviewed the Switch 2 and gave it 8.5 out of 10, noting that the new console has a great design, display and notably better graphics than competitors, like the Steam Deck. The Switch 2 is an excellent overall upgrade and earned an Editors' Choice award from our team. Thanks to its sleek design, the Beats Pill has landed on our list of the best Bluetooth speakers.

More post-Cyber Monday home tech deals: Cyber Monday fell on Dec. 1 this year, which means it’s officially over, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t still deals to be found. The shopping day always lands on the Monday right after Thanksgiving, and as expected, hundreds of price cuts and major online sales went live across the biggest retailers. Now that the day is done and dusted, remaining deals are starting to run dry, so time is running out to shop. Almost all major retailers offered discounts for Cyber Monday, including Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart and Target, as well as specialized retailers like B&H Photo, GameStop and Dell. Keep in mind that physical locations can run out of stock quickly, so online shopping often gives you the best shot at grabbing what’s left. Many retailers launched their deals last week for Black Friday, and some extended them into Cyber Monday. While the official event is over, a handful of last‑minute bargains are still live today, but they won’t last much longer. Some CNET readers are concerned about tariffs and how they could affect holiday shopping. It’s possible tariffs could impact pricing, as we’ve seen related hikes in the past, including on Nintendo Switch consoles. But that doesn’t mean you can’t find great deals on tech and other items. The best way to determine if you’re getting a good deal is to track the item’s price history before making a purchase. Tools like CamelCamelCamel and Price Tracker, or the Keepa browser extension can help. We've rounded up several useful shopping resources, and we’ll continue to highlight the best lingering deals throughout this extended sale period. Not necessarily. Cyber Monday focuses largely on tech, home and lifestyle deals that exist both in person and online. While it started as an online alternative to Black Friday, the two events have blended together as more shopping moves online. That doesn’t mean all the deals are identical, but it does mean finding fresh discounts has become more challenging. The term “black” has historically been used to denote distressing or calamitous events. The earliest known use of Black Friday for the Friday after Thanksgiving was to describe workers calling in sick the day after Thanksgiving in the early 1950s. Around that same time, US police adopted the term to describe the traffic conditions during the first major holiday shopping date. After attempts to rebrand it as “Big Friday” failed, merchants reframed Black Friday as a positive, the profits generated put stores “back in the black” financially. Then, in 2005, the National Retail Federation coined the term “Cyber Monday” after noticing a spike in online traffic the Monday following Thanksgiving. At the time, it was believed shoppers were making online purchases at work to hide gifts from kids and take advantage of faster internet connections. Other names like “Black Monday” or “Blue Monday” were floated, but “Cyber Monday” stuck. By 2014, Cyber Monday had become the biggest online shopping day in the US.

These glasses offer UVA and UVB ray protection, enabling video and regular phone calls, as well as integration with Meta AI for capturing photos and videos. This M4 MacBook Air is the latest addition to Apple's most lightweight lineup, and it's our overall favorite laptop that you can buy right now. The basic 256GB model is on sale for $250 off, though it is temporarily out of stock. You can still order it now to lock in the sale price. Just be aware that there may be a shipping delay. Or you can get a model with double the storage, all while still scoring that $250 discount. The 15-inch model is also on sale for those who prefer a larger display. These over-ear Bose headphones are a slight step down from its pricey Ultra's, and they're a steal at 45% off. They still support active noise cancellation and high-fidelity audio, and have an impressive 24-hour battery life. The Apple Watch SE 3 just hit shelves this fall and is the most affordable smartwatch in Apple's lineup.

Take the hassle out of decorating with Govee’s Christmas Tree Lights at the lowest price we've seen.

Cyber Monday 2025 officially took place on Dec. 1, but some deals are still available at Amazon today, giving shoppers extra time to snag savings. A Prime membership isn't required to shop Amazon's lingering Cyber Monday deals, but some discounts are exclusive to Prime members -- particularly on Amazon's own devices. If you're unsure whether Prime is worth it, consider the other benefits you get with a membership, like faster shipping and bundled perks. Like most major retailers, Amazon is offering huge discounts across a wide range of tech, including headphones, TVs, speakers, tablets and more. Outside of Prime Day, Cyber Monday is the best time of year to score big savings on Amazon's own devices like smart speakers, security cameras and streaming gear (though many of these deals are Prime‑exclusive). With many of the top Cyber Monday deals still live on Amazon, now is a great time to upgrade your tech or check off holiday gifts. It's also a great opportunity to pick up holiday decorations or grab outdoor gear for next year, as retailers clear out remaining seasonal inventory. Both events deliver superb offers across categories, but Prime Day leans heavily on Amazon products such as TVs, smart home devices and Prime membership perks. Members get access to far more exclusive discounts during Prime Day. Cyber Monday, on the other hand, casts a wider net. Virtually all product types from all brands see major markdowns, and while there are still Prime‑exclusive offers, they're fewer compared to Prime Day.
