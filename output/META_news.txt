Now that Nvidia’s top-end GeForce RTX 50 series graphics cards have landed, ready to take on serious 4K gaming, it's high time for a deeper-value option for the 1440p crowd. Nvidia built its GeForce RTX 5070 Ti from the same 4nm GB203 GPU as the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 and pairs it with similar features, like 16GB of GDDR7 memory, but fewer silicon resources. At $749 for base-model cards, the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti looks to be a better value than the $999 RTX 5080: It’s roughly 11% slower at best and 21% slower at worst, but for 25% less cash at MSRP. The actual street prices of these RTX 50-series cards versus their list prices are the big question mark, though; whether you'll be able to get one easily at $749 remains to be seen. (Cards go on sale Feb. 20.) We tested the RTX 5070 Ti in a three-fan Asus Prime GeForce RTX 5070 Ti, a $749-MSRP card that represents the GPU at a decent baseline with room for overclocking. In our tests, it's behind the RTX 5080, but overclocking, if you're intrepid, could make up some of the difference in performance. For that, we give the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti our Editors' Choice award for high-end graphics cards; the RTX 5080 retains the award for "elite level" cards. To create the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti, Nvidia uses an old yet common strategy known as "binning," which sees chipmakers repurposing slightly under-spec silicon in lower-grade, lower-priced products. Nvidia didn’t do this much initially with the Nvidia GeForce RTX 40-series "Ada Lovelace" GPUs, which was surprising for various reasons. That changed with the launch of the RTX 40-series Super graphics cards, and with the RTX 50-series Blackwell parts, you can now see this strategy deployed from the beginning. Essentially, this works as follows. Nvidia starts by creating large graphics chips, like the GB203, which powers the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080, in that case with 10,752 CUDA cores, 336 texture mapping units (TMUs), 112 raster operation processors (ROPs), and 84 ray-tracing (RT) cores. TSMC provides the graphics die on its 4N 4nm fabrication process, and it is relatively large, covering an area of 378mm2 and containing 45.6 billion transistors. Creating computer chips is not a perfect process, though. Inevitably, minor defects creep in, rendering some of the hardware resources on a fabricated chip unusable. Simply tossing these chips out would be wasteful, but stockpiling them is also costly, making it surprising that Nvidia didn’t bin the RTX 40 series from the start. Binning deactivates the circuitry that isn’t functioning correctly, creating a lesser product with fewer total resources available that the chipmaker can charge less for at retail. For instance, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is also based on the GB203 GPU die, but with just 8,960 CUDA cores, 280 TMUs, 96 ROPs, and 70 RT cores active. The GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is also clocked a fair bit slower than the RTX 5080 in terms of its turbo clock, reducing performance. The memory side of the chip remains mostly unchanged, though, which is promising; that frequently gets reduced when creating cut-down cards like this. The RTX 5070 Ti and the RTX 5080 both have 16GB of GDDR7 memory connecting to the GPU over a 256-bit wide bus. The RTX 5070 Ti has slower 28Gbps GDDR7, versus the RTX 5080's 30Gbps GDDR7, reducing bandwidth. The 20% reduction in core count separates the RTX 5070 Ti from the RTX 5080. However, the roughly 6% reduction in turbo clocks and the 7% reduction in memory bandwidth also play a key role in separating the two. These disparities in hardware match up well with the $250 price difference, but real-world performance could set the RTX 5070 Ti closer or further from the RTX 5080. We'll see below. This design also allows Nvidia's GeForce RTX 5070 Ti to have considerable overclocking potential. The GB203 works at higher clock speeds in the RTX 5080, suggesting that the RTX 5070 Ti could also run faster when pushed. The RTX 5070 Ti's reduced clocks are likely in place to distance it from the RTX 5080, rather than due to any limitation of the chip itself. Asus' Prime GeForce RTX 5070 Ti, sent for review, features a large triple-fan thermal solution, predominantly black with some white stripes. The card has a metal backplate with a cutout showing the aluminum fins of the heatsink and several metal heat pipes that help with the cooling process. This cutout also allows air to pass through so that one of the three fans on the front of the card can blow air straight through the heatsink and the card. The card extends out to fill 2.5 slots on the rear I/O panel, with three DisplayPort ports and a single HDMI port. It also requires a 12VHPWR power connection to operate, but Asus includes an adapter that converts three eight-pin PCIe power connectors to one 12VHPWR connection to work with conventional power supplies. (Nvidia suggests a minimum 750-watt power supply to run the RTX 5070 Ti.) The graphics card testbed that we used to test the Asus Prime GeForce RTX 5070 Ti 16GB GDDR7 is built around a Gigabyte X870E Aorus Master motherboard with an AMD Ryzen 9 9950X processor paired with a Cooler Master 360mm Cooler Master water cooler. Two Crucial M.2 PCIe 2TB SSDs and two 16GB sticks of DDR5 RAM clocked at 6,000MHz and set in a dual-channel configuration sort out the storage and memory. Finally, a 1,500-watt Corsair power supply powers the entire system, which is housed in an Asus ProArt chassis. The primary competition for the RTX 5070 Ti comes from the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 and the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX. Though both cards are pricier, they are also older cards that are now going to have a hard time justifying their $999 price tags. Both are close to the RTX 5070 Ti in terms of performance, too. (The Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Super and the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT, at their list prices, are more competitively priced than the RTX 5070 Ti at $749.) The 3DMark results we gathered from the RTX 5070 Ti suggest it will slightly outperform or perform on par with the RTX 4080. Based on the 3DMark scores, it also has the potential to surpass all of the AMD graphics cards, though the Radeon RX 7900 XTX pulled ahead in a few of the 3DMark tests. The RTX 5070 Ti and the RTX 4080 performed similarly in the Unigine Superposition test, which also suggests they might perform similarly in games. We'll see in a moment how that shakes out. Nvidia's GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is quite capable of crunching on content creation tasks. It was essentially tied with the RTX 4070 Ti Super and the RTX 4080 in our Adobe Premiere Pro test. At the same time, it placed a notable step ahead of the AMD cards that we tested. The RTX 4080 also outperformed the RTX 5070 Ti in the GPU-centric trial that we ran in Blender, and it did so by a more meaningful margin specifically in the Monster model (one of the three renders that the test performs). The two cards were more evenly matched in Junkshop and Classroom. Nevertheless, you might be better off sticking with an RTX 4080, if you have one, if you intend to use your graphics card more for content creation work than gaming. Improving AI performance has been a core goal for Nvidia with each new generation of graphics cards, but the extent of the upgrade varies heavily depending on the task at hand. (Testing AI performance in any holistic sense is difficult, particularly as on-card AI muscle addresses a wide range of tasks--training versus inferencing, for one thing. It is impossible with current tools to test a very broad set of AI local-processing scenarios in an all-encompassing way.) This test presses the GPU on a series of text-creation inferencing tasks via four popular AI large language models (LLMs) and produces an overall score in each case. (Here, Procyon uses versions of Mistral, Microsoft's PHI, and two flavors of Meta AI's Llama.) It also reports how many tokens (or discrete units of text, in the context of text generation) the hardware can produce per second with each model. It also measures the time it takes to produce the first token, as getting as much work done as fast as possible is basically AI’s mission statement. Generally speaking, the RTX 5070 Ti topped the RTX 4070 Ti Super and the RTX 4080... The RTX 5070 Ti outpaced the 4080 by varying amounts depending on the test, with the most considerable performance advantage when using the Mistral 7B model. It is faster when using other models, but to a lesser degree. With that, Nvidia has achieved measurable generational gains in AI performance, which will become more relevant as the technology becomes more applicable to everyday users. Black Myth Wukong's benchmark utility supports Nvidia DLSS 3 and AMD FSR 3, with frame generation supported for both. It also supports Intel XeSS, making it ideal for testing these screen-optimization technologies against each other. (As a refresher: frame generation uses AI to insert predictive frames between traditionally rendered ones.) This is a highly demanding title that pushes even the fastest graphics cards to their limit, making frame generation and resolution scaling all but necessary for smooth frame rates. The RTX 5070 Ti couldn't quite keep up with the RTX 5080 in this benchmark test, but it landed in a dead heat with the RTX 4080. Activating DLSS frame generation enabled the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti to slightly outperform the RTX 4080, but enabling FSR's own frame generation also helped the Radeon RX 7900 XTX outperform the RTX 5070 Ti at 1080p and 1440p. The next set of in-game benchmarks more accurately reflects the performance of the graphics cards we test without AI-driven assistance. The results of the synthetic tests suggested that the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti should perform about on par with the RTX 4080. In most cases, this is also what the in-game benchmarks showed, but at times, the RTX 5070 Ti lagged behind the older RTX 4080. Still, 1080p and 1440p frame rates were very respectable across the board, even with the killer Cyberpunk bench. The tests in which the RTX 5070 Ti and the RTX 4080 performed pretty close to each other were Cyberpunk 2077, F1 2024, Far Cry 6, Call of Duty Modern Warfare III, and Returnal. We saw several near-ties between those two graphics cards in these games, but whenever we didn't see a tie in one of these games, the RTX 4080 tended to be on top. In Cyberpunk 2077, for example, the RTX 4080 was 5% faster than the RTX 5070 Ti at 1080p, but the two cards tied at 1440p and 4K. The test scores from F1 2024 showed the same relative results, with the RTX 4080 again slightly ahead at 1080p but tied at other resolutions. The only game that showed the RTX 5070 Ti clearly behind the RTX 4080 without ties was Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora; the RTX 4080 was about 5% faster on average across all three resolutions. Taking a brief look at the RTX 5070 Ti’s performance relative to the RTX 4070 Ti Super or the Radeon RX 7900 XTX, we see both cards are clearly behind the RTX 5070 Ti. At least in AMD's case, this is because Radeon RX 7000-series cards simply have less capable ray-tracing hardware than the Nvidia competition, which holds them back in these tests that support ray tracing. (The RTX 4070 Ti Super also has fewer RT cores.) From a value perspective, this might be Nvidia's most attractive offering in its GeForce RTX 50-series family of graphics cards to date. Nvidia’s RTX 5080 is no doubt faster than the RTX 5070 Ti, but the degree to which the RTX 5080 beats the RTX 5070 Ti is interesting. We’ll spare you a blow-by-blow of percentage differences between these two cards in each game and at each resolution, but overall, the test results showed the RTX 5080 with an 11%-to-21% advantage over the RTX 5070 Ti. That excludes Far Cry 6, which showed signs of a bottleneck by either the processor or the game engine, putting the two cards even closer together. The RTX 5070 Ti costs 25% less, so it's a compelling value. Turning to games that don’t support ray tracing, AMD's Radeon RX 7900 XTX could more competently compete with Nvidia's GeForce RTX 5070 Ti. The RX 7900 XTX didn't pull ahead here except in the Total War: Three Kingdoms at 1440p, but it could at least tie with the RTX 5070 Ti in most tests. One interesting thing these games that lack ray-tracing support show us is actually related to ray-tracing performance. In ray-traced games, the RTX 5070 Ti tended to tie with or lag behind the RTX 4080. This is due to the former's smaller count of RT cores, comparatively speaking, despite architectural improvements with Blackwell. In games that don’t support ray-tracing, the RTX 5070 Ti held a clear advantage at all resolutions. This reflects Nvidia's claimed architectural improvements to its Blackwell CUDA cores, TMUs, and ROPs over the RTX 40-series Lovelace parts. This explains why the RTX 5070 Ti pulled ahead in these pure rasterization-based game tests. At the same time, however, it also shows the ray-tracing hardware of the RTX 5070 Ti isn’t quite as capable as that found on the RTX 4080, which is why the RTX 4080 was able to pull ahead in those games that do support ray-tracing. Though the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti stole a win here from the RTX 4080, consider it a hollow victory. Total War: Three Kingdoms and Shadow of the Tomb Raider are both 2018 games, which we continue to use because they are some of the last games to feature in-game benchmarks that don’t support ray tracing. Ray tracing is now nearly universal for major AAA titles, so you likely will only enjoy this advantage on the RTX 5070 Ti in older games. We measure the power consumption of our graphics card testbed as a whole using a Kill-A-Watt wall meter. This gives us insight into the power draw of each card tested, as the card is the only part that changes between tests. All of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 50-series cards to date have been more power-hungry than their direct predecessors, and the same is true for the RTX 5070 Ti. It doesn’t use that much more than the RTX 4070 Ti Super, only about 5% more at most, according to the test results we gathered. The Asus Prime GeForce RTX 5070 Ti 16GB GDDR7 model we tested also seemed to stay reasonably cool during our tests. It did run a bit warmer than the RTX 4070 Ti Super we tested and a bit warmer than the RTX 4080, but running a bit hotter is also a trend with the RTX 50 series. However, the Prime GeForce RTX 5070 Ti 16GB GDDR7 was cooler than the RTX 5080 Founders Edition during gaming, and its temperatures were well within the typical safe range for graphics cards. The Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is a competent high-end graphics card dunked into a soon-to-be highly competitive market segment. From a value perspective, this might be Nvidia's most attractive offering in its GeForce RTX 50-series family of graphics cards so far, thus earning it our Editors' Choice award. It doesn’t cost $2,000 like the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090, and it costs 25% less at MSRP than the RTX 5080 with an 11%-to-21% drop in speeds, adding up to a better overall value. Better yet, if you're willing to push the card, overclocking could compensate for some of what you lose in performance relative to the RTX 5080. What might be more challenging to overcome for the RTX 5070 Ti is the older Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 Super. We didn’t retest the RTX 4080 Super for this review, but look at the RTX 4080 as a proxy: The RTX 4080 Super is generally about 5% faster than the RTX 4080 and priced at $999 MSRP. That price point for that card isn’t tenable anymore, with the RTX 5080 also at $999, so price drops could set the RTX 4080 Super price closer to that of the RTX 5070 Ti, if you can find one. That would make the RTX 4080 Super the better option, as it also has slightly better performance, but that all depends on what the price will fall to--if, indeed, it even does. That’s difficult to tell for now, as the RTX 4080 Super is sold out or priced above MSRP everywhere we can find it online. The RTX 5070 Ti clearly has the upper hand against AMD’s competing RX 7000-series graphics cards. The Radeon RX 7900 XTX initially launched at $999 and has since been reduced to $899, making it more expensive than the RTX 5070 Ti, which outperforms it. As the market stands, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is an excellent option for anyone looking to avoid paying out for an RTX 5080 but still get high-end 1400p and decent 4K gaming performance. The lack of in-stock competition also makes it a dominant choice in the market at publish time, but just be sure to evaluate against what is in stock when shopping. (The RTX 5070 Ti may well see its own in-stock challenges, like the first two RTX 50 GPUs have.) For the right price, an RTX 4080 Super could be more appealing. Also know that AMD has new cards coming soon, on an announced Q1 2025 timeline, and they could well be right in the RTX 5070 Ti's wheelhouse. Stay tuned, and if you can't find the card readily on sale in the weeks after launch, be patient; more options from AMD and Nvidia alike are coming soon. For as long as I can remember, I've had love of all things tech, spurred on, in part, by a love of gaming.

Now that Nvidia’s top-end GeForce RTX 50 series graphics cards have landed, ready to take on serious 4K gaming, it's high time for a deeper-value option for the 1440p crowd. Nvidia built its GeForce RTX 5070 Ti from the same 4nm GB203 GPU as the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 and pairs it with similar features, like 16GB of GDDR7 memory, but fewer silicon resources. At $749 for base-model cards, the GeForce RTX 5070 Ti looks to be a better value than the $999 RTX 5080: It’s roughly 11% slower at best and 21% slower at worst, but for 25% less cash at MSRP. The actual street prices of these RTX 50-series cards versus their list prices are the big question mark, though; whether you'll be able to get one easily at $749 remains to be seen. (Cards go on sale Feb. 20.) We tested the RTX 5070 Ti in a three-fan Asus Prime GeForce RTX 5070 Ti, a $749-MSRP card that represents the GPU at a decent baseline with room for overclocking. In our tests, it's behind the RTX 5080, but overclocking, if you're intrepid, could make up some of the difference in performance. For that, we give the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti our Editors' Choice award for high-end graphics cards; the RTX 5080 retains the award for "elite level" cards. To create the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti, Nvidia uses an old yet common strategy known as "binning," which sees chipmakers repurposing slightly under-spec silicon in lower-grade, lower-priced products.

However, the roughly 6% reduction in turbo clocks and the 7% reduction in memory bandwidth also play a key role in separating the two. These disparities in hardware match up well with the $250 price difference, but real-world performance could set the RTX 5070 Ti closer or further from the RTX 5080. We'll see below. This design also allows Nvidia's GeForce RTX 5070 Ti to have considerable overclocking potential.

We saw several near-ties between those two graphics cards in these games, but whenever we didn't see a tie in one of these games, the RTX 4080 tended to be on top. In Cyberpunk 2077, for example, the RTX 4080 was 5% faster than the RTX 5070 Ti at 1080p, but the two cards tied at 1440p and 4K. The test scores from F1 2024 showed the same relative results, with the RTX 4080 again slightly ahead at 1080p but tied at other resolutions. The only game that showed the RTX 5070 Ti clearly behind the RTX 4080 without ties was Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora; the RTX 4080 was about 5% faster on average across all three resolutions. Taking a brief look at the RTX 5070 Ti’s performance relative to the RTX 4070 Ti Super or the Radeon RX 7900 XTX, we see both cards are clearly behind the RTX 5070 Ti. At least in AMD's case, this is because Radeon RX 7000-series cards simply have less capable ray-tracing hardware than the Nvidia competition, which holds them back in these tests that support ray tracing. (The RTX 4070 Ti Super also has fewer RT cores.) From a value perspective, this might be Nvidia's most attractive offering in its GeForce RTX 50-series family of graphics cards to date. Nvidia’s RTX 5080 is no doubt faster than the RTX 5070 Ti, but the degree to which the RTX 5080 beats the RTX 5070 Ti is interesting. We’ll spare you a blow-by-blow of percentage differences between these two cards in each game and at each resolution, but overall, the test results showed the RTX 5080 with an 11%-to-21% advantage over the RTX 5070 Ti. That excludes Far Cry 6, which showed signs of a bottleneck by either the processor or the game engine, putting the two cards even closer together. The RTX 5070 Ti costs 25% less, so it's a compelling value. Turning to games that don’t support ray tracing, AMD's Radeon RX 7900 XTX could more competently compete with Nvidia's GeForce RTX 5070 Ti. The RX 7900 XTX didn't pull ahead here except in the Total War: Three Kingdoms at 1440p, but it could at least tie with the RTX 5070 Ti in most tests. One interesting thing these games that lack ray-tracing support show us is actually related to ray-tracing performance. In ray-traced games, the RTX 5070 Ti tended to tie with or lag behind the RTX 4080. This is due to the former's smaller count of RT cores, comparatively speaking, despite architectural improvements with Blackwell. In games that don’t support ray-tracing, the RTX 5070 Ti held a clear advantage at all resolutions. This reflects Nvidia's claimed architectural improvements to its Blackwell CUDA cores, TMUs, and ROPs over the RTX 40-series Lovelace parts. This explains why the RTX 5070 Ti pulled ahead in these pure rasterization-based game tests. At the same time, however, it also shows the ray-tracing hardware of the RTX 5070 Ti isn’t quite as capable as that found on the RTX 4080, which is why the RTX 4080 was able to pull ahead in those games that do support ray-tracing. Though the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti stole a win here from the RTX 4080, consider it a hollow victory. Total War: Three Kingdoms and Shadow of the Tomb Raider are both 2018 games, which we continue to use because they are some of the last games to feature in-game benchmarks that don’t support ray tracing. Ray tracing is now nearly universal for major AAA titles, so you likely will only enjoy this advantage on the RTX 5070 Ti in older games. We measure the power consumption of our graphics card testbed as a whole using a Kill-A-Watt wall meter. This gives us insight into the power draw of each card tested, as the card is the only part that changes between tests. All of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 50-series cards to date have been more power-hungry than their direct predecessors, and the same is true for the RTX 5070 Ti. It doesn’t use that much more than the RTX 4070 Ti Super, only about 5% more at most, according to the test results we gathered. The Asus Prime GeForce RTX 5070 Ti 16GB GDDR7 model we tested also seemed to stay reasonably cool during our tests. It did run a bit warmer than the RTX 4070 Ti Super we tested and a bit warmer than the RTX 4080, but running a bit hotter is also a trend with the RTX 50 series. However, the Prime GeForce RTX 5070 Ti 16GB GDDR7 was cooler than the RTX 5080 Founders Edition during gaming, and its temperatures were well within the typical safe range for graphics cards. The Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is a competent high-end graphics card dunked into a soon-to-be highly competitive market segment. From a value perspective, this might be Nvidia's most attractive offering in its GeForce RTX 50-series family of graphics cards so far, thus earning it our Editors' Choice award. It doesn’t cost $2,000 like the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090, and it costs 25% less at MSRP than the RTX 5080 with an 11%-to-21% drop in speeds, adding up to a better overall value. Better yet, if you're willing to push the card, overclocking could compensate for some of what you lose in performance relative to the RTX 5080. What might be more challenging to overcome for the RTX 5070 Ti is the older Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 Super. We didn’t retest the RTX 4080 Super for this review, but look at the RTX 4080 as a proxy: The RTX 4080 Super is generally about 5% faster than the RTX 4080 and priced at $999 MSRP. That price point for that card isn’t tenable anymore, with the RTX 5080 also at $999, so price drops could set the RTX 4080 Super price closer to that of the RTX 5070 Ti, if you can find one. That would make the RTX 4080 Super the better option, as it also has slightly better performance, but that all depends on what the price will fall to--if, indeed, it even does. That’s difficult to tell for now, as the RTX 4080 Super is sold out or priced above MSRP everywhere we can find it online. The RTX 5070 Ti clearly has the upper hand against AMD’s competing RX 7000-series graphics cards. The Radeon RX 7900 XTX initially launched at $999 and has since been reduced to $899, making it more expensive than the RTX 5070 Ti, which outperforms it. As the market stands, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti is an excellent option for anyone looking to avoid paying out for an RTX 5080 but still get high-end 1400p and decent 4K gaming performance. The lack of in-stock competition also makes it a dominant choice in the market at publish time, but just be sure to evaluate against what is in stock when shopping. (The RTX 5070 Ti may well see its own in-stock challenges, like the first two RTX 50 GPUs have.) For the right price, an RTX 4080 Super could be more appealing. Also know that AMD has new cards coming soon, on an announced Q1 2025 timeline, and they could well be right in the RTX 5070 Ti's wheelhouse. Stay tuned, and if you can't find the card readily on sale in the weeks after launch, be patient; more options from AMD and Nvidia alike are coming soon.

Look back on the day's business news and developments as it happened with our blog. Disclaimer: this blog is not intended as investment advice. By Emily Stewart Prices current around 4:15pm AEDT Live updates on the major ASX indices: By Kate Ainsworth We'll be back again tomorrow for the latest unemployment figures coming from the ABS — but if you're hungry for more news, here's what's coming up on The Business tonight: Catch The Business on ABC News at 8:45pm, after the late news on ABC TV, and anytime on ABC iview. You can also catch up on today's developments below, and download the ABC News app and subscribe to our range of news alerts for the latest news. By Kate Ainsworth The ASX 200 has ended lower on Wednesday, shedding 0.7% to close at 8,419 points. On the sectors front, energy and bank stocks dragged local shares lower — shedding 2.2% and 2.1% respectively. As for individual stocks, it was Mineral Resources which suffered the biggest hit. MinRes shares dipped by more than 21% in response to posting a loss of more than $800 million, and scrapping its interim dividend. Shares in NAB also fell during trade today, after the bank reported a 2% decline in cash earnings, and having its underlying profit increase offset by a higher credit impairment charge. The top performing stocks of the day were: And the bottom performing stocks: By Kate Ainsworth It's still company reporting season — and there's a few ASX heavyweights yet to drop their earnings results this month. Wondering who's left? Let this handy interactive calendar be your guide 👇 And if you need a refresher on how EBITDA differs EPS, look no further than this evergreen resource from the desk of Michael Janda: By Kate Ainsworth While there's more factors at play than just wages data for the RBA to consider before changing interest rates, Professor Fabrizio Carmignani from the University of Southern Queensland says he expects we will see more cuts in the next 12 months. "If I were to make a prediction, I would say that a year from today the interest rate could be somewhere between 3% and 3.25%,"he said. "That is because the overall macroeconomic picture is favourable to a reduction in the interest rate. "There are however some risks, the main risk is related to international trade policy, we will have to see what happens with tariffs. "Tariffs can obviously have an impact on prices and therefore they could represent the potential source of future inflationary pressures. "But in spite of this risk, I still believe there could be a few more cuts in the next 12 months." By Kate Ainsworth Optus's parent company Singapore Telecommunications (also known as SingTel) shared its third quarter profit update earlier today — with the telco company seeing its underlying net profit climb by 22% to S$680 million ($797,368,000). That result was largely driven by Optus, which is SingTel's biggest revenue generator. In the third-quarter, Optus's revenue rose by 3% to S$1.86 billion (roughly $2.2 billion). SingTel also noted that its profit was boosted by its stake in India's Bharti Airtel, which saw a nearly sixfold increase in its own third-quarter net profit. SingTel expects to pay a total ordinary dividend of roughly 16.5 Singapore cents per share. By Kate Ainsworth Professor Fabrizio Carmignani from the University of Southern Queensland says today's wages data shows the RBA's decision to cut interest rates was the right one. "The overall situation is one where inflationary pressures have been reduced quite significantly, and this explains why the RBA decided to cut the interest rate," he said. "This latest data on wages confirms that one of the main drivers of inflationary pressures, which is wages growth, is actually normalising. "Therefore I would say that, taken in context, the decision of the RBA aligns with the overall macroeconomic conditions that we observe in Australia." You can watch his full interview with finance presenter Nadia Daly below: By Kate Ainsworth Speaking in Adelaide, SA Premier Peter Malinauskas has stressed that the state government's decision to put the Whyalla steelworks into administration is about protecting the plant and industry more broadly. "There was an option that we could provide assistance to GFG and Mr Gupta [owner of GFG Alliance], there was an option that we could have bailed out GFC, but we are not going to do that," he said. "This is not about GFG, this is about the critical economic infrastructure that is steelmaking production in this country. "That is the future we need to focus on, not an individual owner of the steelworks. "Our mind turns to providing support for the industry and for the people that work within it to secure sovereign steelmaking in this country, not a bailout for GFG." Our colleagues in Adelaide are covering this breaking story too — you can read more about the SA government's intervention below: By Michael Janda The wage price index is designed to measure changes in base pay — it doesn't capture the effects of promotions, overtime, more people working longer hours and other factors that will push up the pay employees actually receive. A relatively new measure of total wages does, and was also released today by the ABS. It showed that employers paid a total of $102.0 billion in wages and salaries during December 2024, which was up 5.7 per cent from $96.4 billion in December 2023. "This was slower than the growth of 7.3 per cent in December 2023, which reflects the relatively weaker labour market conditions during 2024," noted Bjorn Jarvis, ABS head of labour statistics. "As an aggregate measure of total wages and salaries, the Monthly Employee Earnings Indicator captures all of the compositional changes in the labour market. This includes changes in employment, hours employees were paid for, pay rises and periodic payments. "It complements but is different to the measure of underlying wage growth reported in the Wage Price Index." The 5.7 per cent sounds a lot more impressive than the 3.2 per cent pay rise recorded by the WPI. But you also have to remember that the population grew roughly 2 per cent last year and an even larger proportion of the population entered the labour force. If you divide the total wages and salaries payments for December 2024 and December 2023 by the estimated number of employed persons (from the separate ABS labour force survey), then you find that wages and salaries per employee rose a much more modest 2.6%, or about $173 a month. This is very much a back-of-the-envelope calculation that compares two totally different datasets from different sources — one from the ATO's single touch payroll data, the other from the ABS labour force survey — so it is by no means an accurate estimate. However, it does serve to highlight that per person pay rises were a lot smaller than that headline 5.7% number suggests. By Kate Ainsworth Some breaking news out of Adelaide from our colleague Meagan Dillon — the Whyalla steelworks has been forced into administration by the South Australian government. Changes to the Whyalla Steel Works Act were rushed through both houses of state parliament this morning, before being signed off by the SA Governor. The steelworks, which was owned by GFG Alliance until today, has been in crisis after failing to pay tens of millions of dollars in royalty payments to the government, and millions in unpaid bills to creditors. Just days ago, GFG Chairman Sanjeev Gupta released a statement, saying the company would sell its stake in a New South Wales coal mine to repay Whyalla creditors. "This means that GFG is no longer running the Whyalla steelworks," SA Premier Peter Malinauskas said. By Emily Stewart You will have heard by now the big four banks have passed on yesterday's Reserve Bank interest rate cut of 0.25 percentage points to their variable home loan rates. But what about the smaller lenders? So far, 24 banks and credit unions have passed on the cut in full. Here's the list: Source: Canstar However, the lower rate won't be applied yet. The earliest date lenders will pass on the cut to customers is 21 February, the latest date is 7 March. By Michael Janda We're getting more reaction to the wage price index data out today from the ABS. With wages up 3.2% over the year to December while consumer prices rose 2.4%, workers enjoyed an average real pay increase over the year of 0.8%. In other words, you could by 0.8% more stuff with your base pay than a year ago (the WPI doesn't include pay increases from promotions, bonuses, etc). The Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) says that is a bigger increase in real wages than under nine years of the previous Coalition governments. "Wages don't just go up by accident — they are the result of campaigns by union members and the Albanese government making it easier for working Australians to collectively bargain for pay rises, stopping big business wage cutting schemes and lifting the pay of some of the lowest paid workers in Australia," argued ACTU president Michele O'Neil in a statement. But Indeed Asia-Pacific economist Callam Pickering says Australians will need to see several more years of growing real wages to catch up on the period of high inflation post-COVID. "Adjusted for inflation, Australian wages are still 6% below their peak and, based on the latest wage and inflation forecasts from the RBA, that won't improve at all in the next two years," he wrote. "It highlights just how damaging high inflation can be and how long the recovery will be." He also believes current wage increases could result in higher inflation if they are not matched by improvements in productivity. By Emily Stewart Good afternoon! Business reporter Emily Stewart jumping in here to let you know what's happening on the local sharemarket. Another lacklustre day on the markets so far, with the ASX 200 down 0.4 per cent to 8,444 points and the broader All Ordinaries down about the same amount to 8,725 points (as at 12.35pm AEDT). The worst performing sector today is financials, with NAB down as much as 8.6 per cent, after a disappointing first-quarter earning result. CBA is also in the red (perhaps because it is trading ex-dividend today). Here are the top and bottom movers so far today: By Kate Ainsworth That's the assessment of the latest wages data from Professor Fabrizio Carmignani at the University of Southern Queensland. He told finance presenter Nadia Daly on ABC News Channel that the slowing pace of wages growth is unusual to see with historically low levels of unemployment in the economy. "What we have observed over the last several quarters is a decline in the rate at which wages are growing," he said. "What we have observed is that progressive easing of labour market conditions, which is consistent with declining wage growth. "I would say that unemployment outcomes that we had for the fourth quarter of 2024 was a bit surprising in this sense, probably there was the expectation that unemployment would be a bit higher, instead it continues to be very low. "So we are indeed observing, I would say, a progressive easing of labour market conditions, although unemployment still is performing at its lowest level. "It's an interesting dynamic in the labour market, absolutely." By Michael Janda After today's decision to cut the overnight cash rate (OCR) by 50 basis points to 3.75%, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand says it expects to keep cutting at future meetings. "If economic conditions continue to evolve as projected, the Committee has scope to lower the OCR further through 2025," the bank's monetary policy committee said in its post-meeting press release. That's a contrast to the RBA's communications, which very much played down the extent of further rate cuts after yesterday's initial move to 4.1%. But New Zealand is arguably a bit further ahead in its battle against inflation. "Annual consumer price inflation remains near the midpoint of the Monetary Policy Committee's 1 to 3 percent target band," the statement notes. "Firms' inflation expectations are at target and core inflation continues to fall towards the target midpoint. "The economic outlook remains consistent with inflation remaining in the band over the medium term, giving the Committee confidence to continue lowering the OCR." But it has come at a cost. Unemployment in New Zealand is at 5.1%, even after tens of thousands of unemployed Kiwis crossed the ditch to Australia over the past year or so. The economy has basically been stuck in recession for the past 18 months, with several quarters of negative or zero growth, including a contraction over the last six months of 2024. That makes this line in the RBNZ's statement seem a piece of artful understatement. "Economic activity in New Zealand remains subdued. "With spare productive capacity, domestic inflation pressures continue to ease. Price and wage setting behaviours are adapting to a low-inflation environment. The price of imports has fallen, also contributing to lower headline inflation." But the RBNZ is hopeful of an economic revival this year. "Lower interest rates will encourage spending, although elevated global economic uncertainty is expected to weigh on business investment decisions," the bank's monetary policy committee expects. "Higher prices for some of our key commodities and a lower exchange rate will increase export revenues. Employment growth is expected to pick up in the second half of the year as the domestic economy recovers." If the RBNZ proves too optimistic, New Zealanders looking for work may be left pining for the fjords (or a plane ticket to Australia). By Michael Janda No surprises here. The RBNZ has lowered its cash rate target by 0.5 of a percentage point to 3.75%, as expected by economists and financial traders. By Michael Janda The slowdown in annual wages growth to 3.2% over the year to December was in line with forecasts the RBA published yesterday as it cut interest rates for the first time in more than four years. The ABS wage price index was also in line with most economist forecasts. However, if you look at the RBA's November forecasts, it expected stronger wages growth of 3.4%. Go back further still to the set of forecasts before that, from August, and the RBA was expecting 3.6% wage growth for the year to December 2024. So that's a massive downward revision in the space of just six months. The RBA's economics department has a lengthy track record of consistently overestimating wages growth, including for many years prior to the pandemic. Perhaps they need to have another look at their economic models and the assumptions baked into them to find out where they are going wrong. (To be fair to the RBA, they are doing this, for example this recent research paper which draws on the experience of one of the new board members who was a Fair Work president.). My guess is that the private sector economists who believe the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU) is somewhere closer to 4% rather than the RBA's estimate of about 4.5% may be on the money. After all, if wages growth is decelerating with unemployment at 4% and many other indicators of an apparently "tight" labour market, perhaps those levels are not really that "tight" at all? Why should we care if the RBA's models are wrong? Because if wages growth keeps coming in below forecasts — and the RBA expects a re-acceleration back to 3.4% for the year to June — then it can probably afford to cut interest rates more than it currently expects to. By Samuel Yang Shares of oil and gas producer Santos fall as much as 2.2% to $6.74, last down 2% The company posted lower-than-expected FY underlying profit of $US1.20 billion, a 16% decrease from a year ago, hurt by lower realised prices and slowing production. Stock fell 12.1% in 2024. By Michael Janda The Australian Bureau of Statistics has just released its latest wage price index (WPI). And, even though unemployment is near multi-decade lows at 4%, wage growth keeps falling sharply. Base pay grew just 3.2% over the year to December, down from 3.6% over the year to September and 4.1% over the year to June. It's a very rapid deceleration. "The 0.7 per cent rise this quarter was the equal lowest growth since March quarter 2022," said Michelle Marquardt, ABS head of prices statistics. "At 3.2 per cent, the annual increase in wages was down from 4.2 per cent in December quarter 2023 and is the equal lowest since September quarter 2022." By Samuel Yang The Australian share market has opened sharply lower, tracking losses on Wall Street. The ASX 200 index was down 85 points or 1 per cent to 8,396 by 10:27am AEDT, with financials (-2.5pc) and real estate (-1.7pc) leading the losses. Here are the top and bottom movers at open.

A closely followed hedge fund bet big on Reddit stock last quarter. Coatue Management, a hedge fund led by former Tiger Management employee Philippe Laffont, reported a 6.5 million share stake in the social media company in its latest 13F. The filing, made with the SEC last week and as of December 31, revealed that the nearly $1.1 billion Reddit stake made up about 3.6% of Coatue's $59 billion portfolio of publicly traded stocks. According to Bloomberg, the hedge fund returned 19% in 2024 compared to the S&P 500's gain of about 23%. The hedge fund's recently established stake in the social media company has already proven profitable if it has held onto the shares so far this year. Based on current prices, Coatue's Reddit stake is worth about $1.2 billion, representing a year-to-date gain of $141 million, assuming the hedge fund is still holding onto the stock. While the exact price the fund paid for the stock is not known, shares of Reddit have surged 14% since in 2025 and are up 193% in the last five months. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 has returned 4% year-to-date. Reddit's big gains over the past few months were driven by a strong third-quarter earnings report released in late October. The company revealed a surprise profit, year-over-year revenue growth of 68%, and a 47% surge in daily active users. The stock peaked at about $228 per share on February 10 and has declined about 20% since then. Investors are still digesting Reddit's fourth-quarter earnings results from last week, which revealed a 52% surge in expenses and a traffic hiccup due to a change in Google's search engine. "We expect Reddit to continue making progress across its full-funnel diversification while delivering strong revenue growth & improved profitability," analysts at JPMorgan wrote in a recent note, adding that future changes to Google search are a longer-term risk. The bank rates Reddit at "Neutral" and believes it is trading at about fair value with a $185 price target. Other significant moves made by Coatue during the fourth quarter included a broad sell-off of its Chinese stock holdings and newly established positions in Charles Schwab, Affirm, Okta, and Datadog. The hedge fund's three largest holdings as of December 31 were Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. Coatue did not respond to a request for comment.

LGBTQA+ pride flags in the Google sign to celebrate Gay Pride Month, Manhattan, New York. (Photo by: ... [+] Lindsey Nicholson/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) When I was younger, I had a lovely older neighbor who’d graduated from Harvard as a historian at a time when there was deep antisemitism. He’d share facts and printed old newspaper articles he’d preserved over the years to remind me of the many ways that businesses of every size turned a blind eye to fascism in Europe in the 1930s and significantly profited off of it. All of this makes the head-spinning declarations of loyalty to the Trump Administration that many companies have shown in recent weeks rather curious. Businesses ranging from Google to Meta to Target who once rushed to embrace Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion “initiatives” and celebrate Black History Month have rushed to erase signs of solidarity following the Administration’s various Executive Orders. Many consumers and shareholders feel betrayed. Small businesses and startup entrepreneurs who take their cues from corporations and big tech could be impacted by this sentiment too. But, when corporate practices are unpopular there is an opportunity to learn from their mistakes. Entrepreneurs and small businesses should consider consumer’s values and prepare to position their companies to meet the moment and stay viable as more and more people are purchasing products from businesses that align with their principles. A new Harris poll found that four in 10 Americans have shifted spending to align with their moral views in recent months. Specifically the poll results highlighted: Further, several of Target’s shareholders filed a class action lawsuit against the company on January 24, after the company said it would end DEI initiatives this year, including a program to support Black-owned small businesses that it adopted following the 2020 murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. This betrayal shouldn’t surprise anyone who has cracked open a history book. In the 1930s Hugo Boss made uniforms for the Nazis. IBM supplied the numeric codes tattooed on those ushered into the gas chambers. And Bayer –the aspirin company– is the reincarnation of IG Farben; a huge donor to Nazi political campaigns, a manufacturing beneficiary of Hitler’s invasions of European countries, and a shareholder in the company that produced the gas the Nazis used to exterminate millions of people. Horrifically, the Holocaust’s atrocities turned out to be a whole lot less interesting to the corporate world than how it could be used to profit their businesses. And as Succession’s Shiv Roy declared in a scene with a potential whistleblower: “We don’t get embarrassed.” Let’s run some numbers on where America is and why embracing difference and the uniqueness of people’s lived experiences matters. It’s not just the right thing to do, it’s good for businesses’ bottom line too, and especially for startups and small businesses who rely on forging customer brand loyalty in their early days in crowded markets. The US Presidential election between Trump and Harris was extremely close. For votes counted through November 20th, Trump’s margin over Harris was only 1.62%, according to PBS. On a percentage basis, Trump’s 2024 winning margin was the fourth smallest since 1960. Another contributing factor to the election results is that voter purges have been on the rise election over election and purges historically impact people of color, especially Black voters, according to the NYT. Furthermore, the non-partisan organization League of Women Voters, as of November 6, 2024, tracked 64 anti-voter lawsuits filed in 2024 that sought to sow distrust in the election. Factor in the recent YouGov poll which found that 19 million people who voted for Biden in 2020 abandoned Harris in 2024, and one-third of those cited the war in Gaza in their decision. It was the top reason provided, beating out the economy and immigration, costing Harris more than 6 million votes. In states that swung from Biden to Trump in 2024, 20% cited Gaza in their decision to abstain from voting entirely. Bottom line: Trump did not win the election by a landslide and the majority of people in the US don’t support fascism or authoritarianism. Even current polls show Trump’s popularity with voters sitting at only 47%. People want to support politicians and businesses that align with their values. And that is exactly what many people are now doing so businesses and entrepreneurs everywhere need to stand with the majority. The widely reported mass user exodus from X to alternative startup platforms such as Bluesky has been accelerating steadily and bleeding money from X. The platform has become so alarming to several major advertisers that Elon Musk has mounted multiple lawsuits alleging boycotts. Since Musk endorsed Germany’s far-right AfD party a month ago, Tesla’s sales are tanking across Europe. In some countries like Spain, Tesla’s sales are down as much as 75% year-over-year. The stock price is also down with analysts saying that Tesla’s favorability rating is nearing all-time lows and that this could hurt near-term sales. The unfavorable view of the brand is likely due to Musk. Target’s share price took a steep hit after eliminating DEI initiatives that its own shareholders have filed a lawsuit charging it with fraud. Meanwhile, Costco’s share price is up almost 15% after refusing such rollbacks (a decision backed by 98% of voting shares). Costco also has reported a surge in memberships compared to Sam’s Club which is facing declining memberships. “It’s a sign that consumers with liberal views are starting to use their wallets in response to politics in the private sector,” noted the Harris poll. While a mass exodus from a platform like Meta could be logistically challenging –not least because the US represents such a small percentage of its user base– and such a move has yet to materialize, it would be folly to dismiss it out of hand. More and more users are questioning Meta’s commitment to fighting disinformation and online harassment. As the US TikTok ban loomed, users swarmed to Chinese alternative RedNote, signaling both an appetite and capacity for swift mass mobilization. Such a mass abandonment of Facebook or Instagram alone would have tectonic financial implications, and not just for Meta; the carnage would cascade through the millions of businesses including many small businesses that depend on its advertising model. Even the threat of such shifts could trigger investor anxiety with consequences comparable to past service outages – a 5% dip in share price, equivalent to about $47 billion in losses. Target’s shareholders have already set a precedent for how this might happen. Ultimately, what the numbers tell us is that while some of the biggest companies are lining up to abandon their DEI policies to do business with the Trump Administration, they may find themselves at odds with their customer base who have very different lived experiences and will put their money where their mouth is. This reckless lack of foresight by CEOs should alarm shareholders because it’s consumers who hold the power of the purse. And small businesses and entrepreneurs should seize this opportunity to drive their operations strategy. Because without customers their businesses will cease to exist. *Disclosure: I was previously on the Board of Directors of the League of Women Voters.

Title: Why Intel must stay independent, spin out its foundry and rebuild its iconic brand

UPDATED 18:28 EST / FEBRUARY 16 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante and David Floyer Few brands in technology carry the storied pedigree of Intel Corp. For decades, “Intel Inside” was synonymous with progress in computing — an American icon that repeatedly raised the bar for processor performance and innovation. Today, Intel finds itself in a precarious position. Its once-vaunted manufacturing machine has fallen behind Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp., which dominates advanced process nodes. Meanwhile, Intel’s core central processing unit design business — a substantial, if bruised, revenue engine — remains overshadowed by the mounting losses and capital burn in its foundry operations. Reports swirl that Broadcom Inc. might step in and scoop up Intel’s design arm. But for those who believe in competition, national security and the long-term integrity of an American technology brand, that outcome would be deeply misguided. In this Special Breaking Analysis, we examine why Intel’s design business can — and should — remain an independent powerhouse once the company spins out its foundry operations. We’ll walk through how a spinout might unfold, including an updated scenario from our original bold plan in which TSMC anchors a U.S.-domiciled joint venture. We’ll also detail why the foundry must command a massive discount — perhaps as deep as 90% to 100% of Intel’s sunk investment — and how a “take-or-pay” wafer pre-purchase model from hyperscale cloud providers (Amazon Web Services Inc., Google LLC, Microsoft Corp., Apple Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Nvidia Corp.) can sustain a new American-based foundry while freeing Intel to focus on design excellence. Along the way, we’ll explore the role of advanced nodes such as Intel’s much-touted 18A, and dissect why we feel the assumptions of intellectual property value around 18A might not be as viable as the pundits say. We hope to convey why all these moves serve a broader purpose: to maintain robust competition, fortify national security and preserve an American chip design champion. Intel’s integrated manufacturing strategy was once a key differentiator. By aligning design and process technology in tandem, Intel could produce new microprocessors at a pace the rest of the industry struggled to match. But TSMC’s rise — fueled by enormous wafer volumes from Arm-based mobile processors and an unwavering focus on manufacturing excellence — has left Intel behind in advanced process nodes. The capital intensity of staying competitive at the leading edge has skyrocketed, and Intel’s foundry efforts have yet to attract sufficient scale or external customers. Pat Gelsinger’s return as chief executive initially reignited optimism for a U.S.-based advanced manufacturing renaissance. But the delays in Intel’s roadmap, the cost overruns in ramping new nodes, and the persistence of TSMC’s leadership suggest that Intel’s foundry plan remains outgunned. Meanwhile, the design side of Intel’s house — responsible for everything from x86 CPUs for PCs and servers to emerging artificial intelligence accelerators — still has enormous potential. The problem is that this potential remains shackled by the continuous drain of Intel’s foundry ambitions. For more context, read our Critical Analysis on the Root Cause of Intel’s Troubles. Reports of Broadcom acquiring Intel’s design business reflect a short-term mindset. Broadcom has built its empire through acquisition, focusing on cost efficiencies and leveraging synergies across enterprise software, networking and semiconductors. Intel in many ways would fit Broadcom’s strategy of acquiring durable businesses. Handing over Intel’s CPU design business — a bedrock of American microprocessor leadership — would inevitably concentrate more market power. That’s not only a threat to healthy competition; it risks overshadowing Intel’s legacy and future innovation. Given the heightened scrutiny on tech mergers and acquisitions by both U.S. and international regulators, a Broadcom-Intel design merger could and should face drawn-out investigations or outright rejection. Moreover, Intel’s stock price is depressed compared with historical peaks, in no small part because of the drag from manufacturing. Why sell the design arm now, when it’s arguably at a cyclical low? Once the foundry baggage is removed and Intel’s design group can stand on its own merits — much like Advanced Micro Devices Inc. did when it spun off GlobalFoundries — there’s every possibility for a resurgence. Selling at the bottom of the cycle would shortchange shareholders and kill an iconic brand that still has real technological capital. Intel’s board owes it to shareholders, employees and the broader tech industry to keep the design business independent. Yes, the integrated manufacturing approach has proven costly, and yes, the foundry is likely a negative-value asset as it stands. But there is precedent for this kind of strategic realignment: IBM Corp. paid GlobalFoundries to take its microelectronics division in 2014. AMD separated its fabs in 2009 and eventually became a formidable design-centric competitor. Today, AMD relies on TSMC to manufacture its designs at leading-edge nodes. With the money drain from manufacturing gone, AMD could focus on architectural innovation — an effort that has paid off handsomely. In the same vein, Intel can rebuild its design brand and engineering culture once it is liberated from the massive overhead of running advanced-node fabs. The board shouldn’t tap out and sell the design side to a competitor; it should step up and ensure that an iconic American brand continues to innovate in CPUs, graphics processing units, AI and custom silicon markets. Intel in our view has no choice but to exit manufacturing. To spin out foundry will likely require a substantial discount — some might even call it “paying someone to take it off their hands.” In 2014, IBM effectively wrote GlobalFoundries a large check to absorb its microelectronics business, transferring factories, employees and IP. Intel’s foundry operations have consumed billions in capital with underwhelming yields and missed process milestones. Critics may point to 18A as a potential game-changer, but the reality is that 18A is behind schedule, unproven and not generating revenue. To entice a partner such as TSMC to operate these fabs in the U.S., Intel must accept that much of its capital investment will not be recovered. A 90% to 100% discount relative to the book value of Intel’s foundry assets may sound extreme, yet it’s not unprecedented when the alternative is ongoing, multibillion-dollar losses. This is the cost of a strategic reset. Intel has touted 18A as the company’s hope to leapfrog TSMC. But each roadmap slip erodes market confidence and 18A’s negative profitability was never going to allow Intel to catch TSMC with this node. The deeper truth is that the real wave of future manufacturing innovation was more likely with what Intel calls 14A (or some iteration of that node) — combining backside power delivery, gate-all-around and next-generation High-NA EUV in a more mature process window. We’ve always said this was an extremely risky and unproven endeavor but in the unlikely event Intel could pull it off, it would have likely represented a leapfrog in process relative to TSMC. But the probability of success in a reasonable timeframe was always very low. However, 14A in the JV’s hands under TSMC’s guidance would likely be more fruitful. Because it has profitable advanced nodes already, it could take its time with 14A rather than trying to catch up in desperation. TSMC has the financial and operational discipline to integrate new techniques properly. If TSMC is part of a U.S.-domiciled JV, it can exercise that discipline on what remains of Intel’s advanced node R&D while leveraging some of Intel’s IP. In this scenario, 14A would find a more reliable steward in TSMC than Intel’s own cash-strapped and time-pressured foundry operation. The likely scenario is a joint venture — wholly based in the United States — where TSMC contributes expertise, intellectual property and skilled engineering teams deployed stateside. Unlike typical equity investments, TSMC might not contribute much upfront cash. Instead, it would bring intangible but invaluable process know-how, yield ramp experience and world-class manufacturing talent. The U.S. government’s CHIPS Act funds could partially offset capital expenses, while private equity players provide debt financing backstopped by either Washington or the JV’s assets. Under this arrangement, Intel’s foundry assets and workforce transfer to the JV. TSMC becomes the majority stakeholder or at least the primary operator, ensuring that day-to-day manufacturing decisions align with TSMC’s methodology. Intel, for its part, might retain a minority stake but cede operational control — effectively paying to hand over the reins to the world’s most competent foundry operator. The discount on Intel’s assets is baked into the deal; it reflects the expensive truth that Intel’s fabs have negative economic value unless someone can turn them around. Below is a revised and simplified version of our original CAP table: One of the greatest hurdles for a newly spun-out foundry is securing enough volume to achieve economies of scale. TSMC thrives on huge wafer starts from Apple, MediaTek Inc., AMD, Nvidia and many others. Intel’s x86 business alone won’t provide the necessary volume, especially if it’s behind TSMC’s own leading-edge processes. So, the solution is to bring in the U.S. hyperscalers — AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Meta, Nvidia, the U.S. military and others — that each have a vested interest in: By structuring multiyear “take-or-pay” wafer pre-purchase contracts, the hyperscalers guarantee consistent demand regardless of yield ramp challenges. This arrangement underwrites the JV’s operational costs during the toughest early years. The “take-or-pay” concept means that if yields remain low or the node is behind TSMC’s mainstream lines for a while, these cloud giants still pay for the capacity. In return, they get guaranteed supply when (and if) the JV’s yields improve, plus the political goodwill of being seen as partners in securing U.S. semiconductor independence. The crux of this model is that the guaranteed demand from hyperscalers offsets the typical scale disadvantage a new foundry would face. This approach also dovetails with the government’s desire to see advanced node manufacturing thrive on U.S. soil, thereby reducing national security risks tied to any instability in Asia. The internet giants are placing large, multiyear bets on American silicon. But it’s not a classic equity investment. Instead, each of these firms would be committing to substantial “take-or-pay” wafer agreements, locking in critical supply for advanced semiconductors without the long wait for a traditional equity return on investment. In exchange, the U.S. government would take its foot off the necks of these companies in the form of relaxed regulatory pressure and onerous oversight. For years, Apple and the hyperscalers have relied almost exclusively on TSMC’s Taiwanese fabs. That’s understandable — TSMC is the gold standard in advanced node manufacturing. But rising geopolitical tensions underscore the risk of tying all capacity to a single region. By participating in a new U.S.-based JV, these companies gain a dependable second source for high-performance chips, hedging against sudden disruptions. From iPhone systems-on-chip to AI accelerators, every hyperscaler wants an uninterrupted flow of silicon. Being first to market with new AI and machine learning capabilities or next-generation consumer devices can mean the difference between industry leadership and playing catch-up. A domestic advanced node foundry, even if initially lagging TSMC’s bleeding edge by a half-step, gives these firms a crucial foothold in American-made chips — a prospect that has become priceless. What do these hyperscalers get beyond supply assurance? A more predictable regulatory climate. In Washington, the appetite to scrutinize Big Tech — whether over antitrust, privacy or monopolistic practices — has only grown. Committing massive wafer prepayments to a strategic U.S. foundry aligns their corporate goals with the government’s national interests. By no means are we suggesting these firms get a total regulatory pass. But the sheer scale of their take-or-pay deals supports America’s push for domestic semiconductor leadership, buying goodwill and tempering how aggressively regulators wield the antitrust hammer. For these companies, predictability in the legal arena translates into billions of dollars in strategic value. Moreover, the U.S. government in our scenario would pressure EU regulators to back off as well, in exchange for a more stable supply chain for advanced silicon. Since the U.S. is funding the future of silicon, it has the moral authority to pressure EU regulators to moderate their anti-Big Tech stance against U.S. companies. By opting for wafer guarantees rather than equity stakes, the hyperscalers sidestep the classic venture capital pitfall of waiting a decade for payback. Every one of these companies is in constant need of leading-edge silicon; paying upfront for guaranteed capacity isn’t just a hedge, it’s an essential input to their day-to-day business. So unlike a typical long-horizon investment, these wafer commitments deliver near-term strategic value: a stable supply of advanced chips to fuel growth in AI, cloud services, consumer devices and more. In return, the new foundry scores sustained demand. Even if early yields lag behind TSMC’s global best, the arrangement smooths out the revenue cycle while the JV works to improve yield and process maturity. It’s a symbiotic setup: Big Tech gets supply and the foundry gets a stable customer base and a realistic shot at scale. Apple Apple has long been TSMC’s shining star, but a single point of manufacturing failure is no longer tenable. Diversifying to a domestic foundry paves the way for second-source security across iPhone, iPad and Mac chips. Over the long haul, Apple might also co-develop next-gen packaging lines at the JV, ensuring it retains a competitive edge in device performance. AWS AWS is hungry for capacity for its Graviton CPUs, Trainium and Inferentia AI chips, plus whatever HPC solutions loom on the horizon. And there’s a regulatory carrot: If Amazon helps secure U.S. semiconductor leadership, the government will commit to soften scrutiny around its e-commerce dominance. Google Google Cloud’s TPU programs demand advanced silicon to power AI/ML workloads at large scale. A domestic foundry removes the uncertainty of Taiwanese supply lines and the U.S. government would agree to lessen its scrutiny around data privacy or large-scale acquisitions. Predictability here is priceless for a company whose approach is “move fast and innovate.” Microsoft Microsoft’s diverse product suite spans cloud hardware, AI chips (Project Athena) and even Xbox SoCs. A stake in U.S.-based capacity can deflect the usual antitrust chatter around Office and Windows bundling. The real boon is ensuring timely access to advanced nodes for its AI and console businesses. Meta Meta faces heavy scrutiny on social media policy and data privacy. Securing advanced-node chips for AI inference, training, and upcoming AR/VR headsets is mission-critical. Making big wafer commitments demonstrates goodwill that could soften regulators’ stances on everything from user data to content moderation. Nvidia As the go-to provider of GPUs for AI and gaming, Nvidia constantly grapples with supply shortages — and no one knows that better than data center customers. Having a domestic fab option helps shield against overseas risk and further ingratiates Nvidia to U.S. policymakers, potentially smoothing the road for future expansions or acquisitions. Additional stakeholders in this model could include the U.S. military, Qualcomm Inc., Tesla Inc., MediaTek, AMD and possibly IBM, which could also contribute IP from its advanced research in chips. A U.S.-based advanced foundry JV, underpinned by these massive “take-or-pay” agreements, is more than a financial arrangement. It’s an ecosystem-level deal that ties the fortunes of Big Tech to America’s semiconductor resurgence. Each hyperscaler hedges against global uncertainty and gains a modicum of regulatory relief in the process. Meanwhile, the JV secures guaranteed demand from day one — enough to build momentum toward competitive yields, node maturity and long-term viability. In short, this is a bet on stability — geopolitical, operational and regulatory — and at a time when advanced silicon has become the oil of the digital economy. We believe that’s an investment well worth making. Total Upfront Payments: $25 billion Total Milestone Payments: $19 billion Grand Total: $44 billion (over five years) Note: These figures are illustrative to show a hypothetical scale. They should be adjusted based on overall fab construction costs, negotiated TSMC licensing fees, and a reasonable node volume. This structure gives the new American Foundry approximately $100 billion in capital over a five-year period. With TSMC’s leadership, process expertise and talent injection it dramatically increases the chances of having a viable advanced semiconductor manufacturing source on U.S. shores with a U.S.-domiciled company. Once the foundry is spun out, Intel can refocus on its core: designing innovative CPUs, GPUs, AI accelerators and custom silicon solutions. By removing the financial and managerial overhead of manufacturing, Intel’s leadership can redeploy cash toward R&D in architecture, software stacks, packaging innovation and go-to-market partnerships. A streamlined Intel might look a lot like AMD, Nvidia or Qualcomm — fabless (or fab-lite) — yet able to bring advanced chip designs to market quickly by tapping TSMC’s best processes. Intel could still have preferential access to the newly created JV, securing capacity for its own x86 lines at better rates or guaranteed volumes. But if that JV lags TSMC’s mainline by too much, Intel’s design arm could also choose to go direct to TSMC’s Taiwan fabs or Samsung’s foundries. This freedom would be an enormous boost to Intel’s competitiveness. No longer chained to a sub-scale manufacturing model, Intel design engineers can choose whichever advanced node best suits the product timeline and competitive environment. An independent Intel design division also satisfies the concerns of regulators who fear large-scale consolidation. Selling the design arm to Broadcom would add to the wave of semiconductor M&A that the government is already carefully scrutinizing. By staying independent, Intel remains a distinct competitor in CPU, HPC and AI markets. The U.S. Department of Defense also gains because Intel can keep focusing on specialized designs for defense-related applications, while the new JV foundry (with TSMC stewardship) handles secure manufacturing on American soil. It’s a synergy that retains critical R&D in the United States, fosters multiple points of competition, and ensures a stable supply chain for military and civilian infrastructure. TSMC has already broken ground on fabs in Arizona, though it has struggled with costs and workforce challenges. Critics question whether TSMC will allocate its best technology to U.S. sites. In the proposed JV scenario, TSMC could opt to transfer a slightly older node to ensure it retains absolute leadership in Taiwan. The new entity might operate at “N-1” levels of technology. Yet for many hyperscaler workloads — such as server CPUs, AI inference chips or specialized accelerators — being a generation behind might be acceptable when weighed against the security of local supply. Over a decade, with guaranteed volume and financial stability, that JV could close some of the gap if TSMC invests in incremental process improvements. One could argue that the U.S. government wants Intel to succeed as a standalone integrated manufacturer. But the repeated delays and huge losses reveal that Intel won’t ever catch up to TSMC alone (without unlimited capital and time). The CHIPS Act aims to ensure advanced node capacity exists in the U.S., not necessarily that Intel remains integrated if that model is doomed to fail. A TSMC-led JV, operating on U.S. soil, employing tens of thousands of Americans, and financed partly by Big Tech’s wafer prepayments, meets the spirit of the CHIPS Act. For the government, it’s a pragmatic solution to ensure advanced manufacturing doesn’t vanish entirely from American shores. A valid concern is that Intel might lose its “co-optimization” advantage by spinning out manufacturing. But the success of AMD, Nvidia and Apple’s silicon team indicates that close partnerships with TSMC can achieve better results than a sub-scale in-house approach. Intel’s advanced packaging technologies (such as EMIB and Foveros) can be licensed to or co-developed with TSMC under commercial agreements. As an independent design entity, Intel can become more nimble, not less. Take-or-pay contracts assume that advanced node yields will improve over time. Early yields might be poor. The hyperscalers, however, get two things they value: guaranteed capacity (even if it’s behind TSMC’s leading edge) and better regulatory standing with the government. Over the long haul, if yields are too low and the JV fails, the hyperscalers would still have TSMC’s mainline in Taiwan (or Samsung) as a fallback. Because these are multiyear deals, the JV has enough runway to fix process issues, guided by TSMC’s real-world experience. Rather than ceding its legacy to Broadcom or any other suitor, Intel should embrace a strategic pivot that upholds competition, national security and the spirit of American innovation. The steps are clear, albeit not easy: Intel’s board is under pressure to deliver shareholder value in the wake of ongoing foundry failures. Selling Intel’s design business to Broadcom might look like a quick fix, but it would sacrifice a venerable American brand at the lowest point of its valuation — an outcome that undermines competition, national security and the legacy of one of tech’s greatest innovators. We believe it is incumbent on this board, which oversaw the flawed IDM 2.0 strategy, to preserve Intel as an independent entity and support the hard work it will take to give rebirth to this American icon. The visionary and entirely viable route is to spin out the foundry, swallow the painful discount, and let Intel’s design house flourish independently. We’ve seen the positive results of such a strategy with AMD, which soared after distancing itself from foundry headaches. With a TSMC-led joint venture offering a U.S.-based alternative to Taiwan’s facilities — and hyperscalers incentivized to prepay for wafer volume — this scenario provides a lifeline for advanced semiconductor manufacturing in America. It keeps Intel relevant in the CPU, GPU and AI arenas. It aligns with government aims for robust competition and supply chain security. And it ensures that “Intel Inside” remains more than just a memory. In short, Intel’s next chapter need not be defined by a desperate sale to a conglomerate. The foundry spinout is a bitter pill, but once swallowed, it could liberate Intel’s design prowess for decades to come — reestablishing it as a powerhouse of American innovation, sustaining competition across the CPU and AI markets, and serving as a keystone in the broader effort to restore domestic semiconductor manufacturing leadership. It’s a vision that demands courage from Intel’s board, patience from its shareholders, and cooperation from the U.S. government and partners like TSMC and the hyperscalers — but one that could ultimately salvage Intel’s future as an iconic force in technology.

Title: Tech Insider: A big move ahead of Spark’s earnings, more Callaghan ‘chaos’, Southlander’s start-up raises A$5m – and who is NZ’s DOGE-master?

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. An investment fund backs up the truck ahead of Spark’s half-year earnings on Friday. An insider details Callaghan ‘chaos’ as the agency enters its defunding death spiral. An Invercargill-born entrepreneur scores A$5 million for his start-up. It’s 3am Eternal for owners of US shares who’ve gained access to extended trading. And an authoritative poll reveals who could lead a DOGE-like initiative in NZ - or not. Ahead of its half-year earnings this Friday, some analysts and fund managers still rate Spark a “sell”. Others say it’s been beaten down so far its shares are a “buy”. ACC has just revealed it is in Camp Buy. Our state accident insurer’s investment wing – which has leaned tech-sceptic over the past couple of years, compared to our other Crown giant, the NZ Super Fund – disclosed on February 13 that it had topped up its stake in Spark to just above the 5% major holding threshold between October 12 and February 12 by purchasing $52.2 million worth of Spark shares on the NZX and A$27.5m ($30m) worth on the ASX. Craigs is Camp Sell – or at least it put Spark in its bad books as its earnings preview clumped NZX firms into positive, neutral and negative piles. After an unusual miss for its full-year earnings, delivered last August, Spark surprised again – and again in a bad way – by lowering its FY2025 guidance in October. Craigs says there is “some chance of a further downgrade” but that this possibility is already built into the telco’s price. “A key focus will be on FCF [free cashflow] cover for dividends and the extent to which the current weakness is macro-driven or due to increased competition.” In other words, how much of a poor result could be pinned on the crummy economy and Government IT departments shelving their chequebooks, and how much can down to post-merger 2degrees being on a roll? Morningstar’s Brian Han says investors have over-sold, and Spark represents good buying as long as it sees through cost-cutting. Forsyth Barr analysts Aaron Ibbotson and Benjamin Crozier, who downgraded Spark to “underperform” on February 14, with a $2.80 12-month target (shares closed Friday at $2.90), said there is “potential for a restructuring charge to be pulled out of its ebitda [earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation] guidance”. The pair also want an update on the capital-raising push announced at Spark’s full-year result in August, when chair Justine Smyth said the telco would explore various options to raise $1b for data-centre expansion over the next five years. They want to see a construction timeline, too. A Callaghan Innovation insider alleges potential issues with commercial contracts and an ongoing hazchem disposal issues Some 350 Callaghan Innovation staff already know their agency is going to lose its funding on June 30 – with some jobs going to other agencies, if on a lag of up to six months, with enabling legislation for science sector changes not due before Parliament before the fourth quarter and not coming into effect until next year. Callaghan offers research services for early-stage firms and developers of new technologies, and administers growth grants and the Government’s tax rebate for R&D. Earlier this month, the Public Service Association said Callaghan staff did not know who would get a role with another agency under a sweeping science sector restructure or when – leading some to look offshore for work in what the union says is a “brain-drain of the Government’s own making”. Late last week, a Callaghan staffer – whose name has been withheld – wrote to the Herald about what they saw as “the chaos and widespread damage caused by the Government’s decision to disestablish this vital department. Most of us were told of the closure only on the morning the press release went out, leaving staff completely stunned and unprepared”. “I would like to particularly highlight the significant losses and the catastrophic consequences of the lack of planning surrounding this enormous decision. The situation at Callaghan is an utter shambles and it’s clear that nothing has been properly thought out. From the perspective of both staff and many established customers, it feels as though the Government is attempting to fly a plane while it is still being built,” the staffer wrote. “For example, no one at Callaghan knows when their final paycheque will come. Only the 80 staff members who were given four weeks’ notice on February 12 – mostly from the research & development team, business innovation advisors and some internal functions like marketing – have any certainty. For everyone else, there is no clarity on when we will be let go, except that it will happen in ‘waves’. “This lack of detailed information has serious consequences for employees’ ability to plan for the future and, more importantly, their mental health.” They continued: “The Gracefield [research] site has received no direction on what will happen next. Staff are being forced to figure out not only how to manage the loss of staff but also how to dispose of chemicals and other scientific materials safely. The risk of legal and compliance issues resulting from this poor planning is substantial and the administrative cost of unwinding this hasty and poorly managed shutdown will only increase over time.” Last year, a leaked memo said hazardous goods storage is not up to scratch in some of Callaghan’s laboratories, with $120m in remediatory work required over the next five years. In a letter of expectations leaked to the Herald earlier this month, new Science, Innovation and Technology Minister Shane Reti instructed Callaghan to “explore commercial opportunities to retain the Gracefield site as a centre for science and innovation” – presumably for the yet-to-be-detailed public research organisation envisioned by the Government. The staffer continued: “Callaghan scientists also undertake critical scientific research under contract for numerous businesses. “These contracts often extend well beyond the June disestablishment date, leaving customers in limbo, unsure of who, if anyone, will be able to carry on their commercial work. “Many of these businesses are now facing serious challenges, with expensive and time-sensitive R&D work halted with no plan for how to proceed. The scientists working on these projects are highly specialised and their expertise cannot be easily replaced.” Tech Insider put the staffer’s comments to Callaghan chief executive Stefan Korn. “I know this is a difficult and distressing time for our people. We’re working at pace to give staff and customers certainty about how the disestablishment of the organisation will affect them,” Korn replied. “However, winding up an organisation as complicated as Callaghan Innovation is not straightforward. We have multiple challenges to work through, including the transfer of some functions to other entities, the shutdown of other parts of the organisation and the safe and effective management of the Gracefield Innovation Quarter [GIQ]. “For example, planning work is now under way to safely deal with the disposal of a large range of chemicals and hazardous substances that have been used by the scientists at GIQ over the years.” Korn added: “As much as we would’ve liked to give people answers on day one, it’s important to work through the detail and get things right. “We’re doing everything we can to support our people and customers in this transition.” “The science sector reforms aim to ensure we focus our investment that will generate greatest value for our economy and our people,” Reti said. “Callaghan Innovation was spread too thin across many conflicting functions – it’s struggled to work to a clear focused purpose. “To better support and incentivise innovation for economic growth, we have decided to disestablish Callaghan Innovation and establish a new Public Research Organisation [PRO] to focus on delivering research in AI [artificial intelligence], synthetic biology, aerospace, medical and quantum technologies. “Some of Callaghan’s functions will be transferred to MBIE [the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment] or the new PRO. “Some functions will not be transferred, so an in-principle decision has been made for the funding to be reallocated. “I understand that in this round of change, the board of Callaghan Innovation has considered roles that aren’t currently working on customer contracts. “I acknowledge that these changes will be challenging for staff involved. I am confident that the science reforms ... will strengthen our science system and create more opportunities for economic growth over time.” Earlier this month, Callaghan senior research scientist Ben Wylie-van Eerd told the Herald that while the Government had outlined plans for a new advanced technology research organisation, the lack of a firm timeline – other than a legislative timetable indicating it was at least six months away, and probably more – meant a lot of his colleagues were already job-hunting for offshore roles. Trump’s talking up more tariffs. Ukraine is offering the US priority access to lithium as it bargains for its life. Think Tesla’s going to have a good day? Now you place a punt before the Nasdaq’s opening bell. Trading platform CMC recently launched extended-hours trading on the “Magnificent Seven” stocks (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla). The move proved so popular that CMC has now increased the breadth of extended hours trading to 80 popular US stocks, CMC’s Markets New Zealand general manager Chris Smith says. Kiwis can start pre-market trading from 10pm NZT, well before the US stock exchanges open at 3.30am NZT. “We’ve seen recently that international news can have a major impact on markets and we want to give our investors the best opportunity to react as fast as they can,” Smith told Tech Insider. Invercargill-raised Derek Troy-West has raised A$5m at a $A25m valuation for the software start-up he founded with his wife. Troy-West did a computer science degree at Auckland University then worked as a software developer for Spark before heading to the UK for a few years, where he met his wife Kylie Forge (now Kylie Troy-West), an Australian also on her OE after graduating from La Trobe. The pair settled back in Melbourne in 2012 and founded Factor House in 2019. The start-up builds developer tools that allow engineers to manage the processing of massive amounts of real-time data. Its first product, Kpow, is an engineering toolkit designed to enhance and simplify the management of Kafka – an open-source distributed-event-streaming platform developed by LinkedIn that allows data to be transported efficiently and accurately between different systems and applications. Customers include Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Block, Pepperstone and Afterpay. The A$5m seed raise was led by Australasia’s largest venture capital (VC) firm, Blackbird. Factor House said the round was supported by others including Auckland-based angel investor Steven Holmes – who made his investment in a personal capacity but is perhaps best-known in the VC community as the director of rich-lister Murray Bolton’s family office, Bolton Equities. Sorry, I had to ask. Half of my self-selecting sample of my followers on LinkedIn hated the idea of Prime Minister Christopher Luxon replicating Elon Musk’s DOGE rampage in the US with a local tech figure in charge. I would have added recent policy enthusiast Rod Drury, too, but LinkedIn only allows four choices (and doesn’t support embedding, so I had to recreate it above but see the original here). You could say former Telecom and Spark executive Simon Moutter is now in the frame, too, given he was recently made chair of Kāinga Ora (with former Spark “chief turnaround officer” Matt Crockett appointed Kāinga Ora’s chief executive around the same time). Comments ranged from “the constitutional equivalent of arson” to “I don’t think anyone in NZ has the stomach for it” to various proposals to streamline a spending purger with AI. Steven Joyce and Richie McCaw got write-ins. Feel free to leave your take in Comments below (once Comments are open). Chris Keall is an Auckland-based member of the Herald’s business team. He joined the Herald in 2018 and is the technology editor and a senior business writer. Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read.

Title: 'A total con': Scam ads featuring fake Irish shops are still appearing on Facebook and Instagram

We need your help now Support from readers like you keeps The Journal open. You are visiting us because we have something you value. Independent, unbiased news that tells the truth. Advertising revenue goes some way to support our mission, but this year it has not been enough. If you've seen value in our reporting, please contribute what you can, so we can continue to produce accurate and meaningful journalism. For everyone who needs it. SCAM ADVERTISEMENTS THAT use artificial intelligence to masquerade as independent shops in Ireland are continuing to run online, despite previous complaints about similar cons. The ads, various versions of which are running on Meta platforms Facebook, Instagram and Messenger, appeal to the consumer’s sympathy, citing financial hardship, break-ins or tragic fires as the reason for the closure of the ‘family-run’ stores. One shop, ‘Walsh Kildare’, has multiple ads running. One claims they are closing down because of a recent fire, while another says they’re closing because of a break-in. The websites the ads link to are only a few months old and people who have purchased from them say the goods are cheap and come from China, not Ireland. It’s a new take on scam ads that have been around for months, where text and images are generated by artificial intelligence, some with more convincing results than others. An ad for 'Walsh Kildare', which claims to be closing down after a break in Some of the ads have obvious AI generated images. This can be identified by dramatic imagery, bad spelling on signs and inconsistent details. Other ads use generic stock photos of shops, people and clothing. An Instagram story for Aidens Kildare that has a 'closure sale' sign spelled incorrectly Instagram Instagram When you search for the shops on Google, no physical store shows up. They also don’t have a physical address on the website. When looking at the Facebook pages that posted the ads, you can see under ‘page transparency’ that they’re not moderated from an Irish location, but rather countries such as the United States and Vietnam. Users can report ads they believe violate Meta’s policies by clicking the three dots in the upper right hand corner of the ad. The scams go against Meta’s rules. It claims it doesn’t “allow advertisers to run ads that promote products, services, schemes or offers that use identified deceptive or misleading practices, including scams to take money from people or access personal information”. Meta declined to comment on the continuous presence of the ads on its platforms. An Instagram ad for 'Byrne Cork'. There is no store with this name in Cork Aidens Kildare is another fake shop that is “closing down”. Its site, aidenskildare.com, was created less than five months ago, according to a domain age checker. Advertisement The quality of the clothing has been described as “dire” on Trustpilot, and several people say they waited months for a refund, or weren’t given one at all. On Trustpilot, where customers can leave reviews of companies, 97% of people gave “Aidan’s Kildare” a 1-star rating (the lowest one can give), with several customers accusing the shop of scamming. “Total scammers!! You will receive junk from China,” they wrote. “They say you can keep item and they’ll give you 30% off next purchase! When you finally get a return address it’s in China and you have to pay to return, and even with tracking, they say they haven’t received it.” Another unhappy customer wrote: ”Avoid this store when you see advert on Facebook or elsewhere!!! Bloody scammers pretending to be an Irish company. “Took 1 month for sub standard jackets to arrive from China. My arms couldn’t even get through the ill- fitted cheap quality clothes.” One customer said Aidan’s Kildare is “false advertising”, as there’s “no such shop in Kildare”. 'Moda Kildare' website, which is four months old Moda Kildare is another shop that operates using the same scamming techniques. Its logo has the colours of the Irish flag underneath it, but customers say it’s not based in Ireland at all. Its website was created only four months ago, and reviews report it selling “cheap crap” at a relatively high price. The fake websites are an example of dropshipping, where a seller accepts orders without keeping stock on hand or having a physical shop. The seller transfers the orders and their shipment details either to the manufacturer, a wholesaler, another retailer, or a fulfillment house, which then ships the goods directly to the customer. The Journal previously asked the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (CCPC) about what a person should do if they think they have been duped by one of these websites. The commission said that anyone who believes they have been scammed should immediately contact their bank or credit card issuer, who can place their account and card on hold while they investigate the problem. Anyone who has been caught by a scam should contact Gardaí, who have advice about online shopping fraud and how to avoid scams on their website. Coimisiún na Meán, which regulates online platforms in Ireland, also said that when users discover something that they think is illegal or against a platform’s rules, they should report it to the relevant platform. If a person can’t find a way to do this or if they’re unhappy with how the platform has responded to them, they can contact the commission.
