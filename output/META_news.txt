Title: META Stock: Path To 2x Growth

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. META stock (NASDAQ: META) has delivered 2x returns, rising from $370 in early 2024 to roughly $785 today. The company’s evolution into an AI-driven advertising leader, together with Instagram’s revenue strength and substantial infrastructure spending, creates several avenues for the stock to potentially double again. At just 28x trailing earnings versus Amazon’s 35x and Microsoft’s 38x, Meta screens as compelling value with meaningful upside. We’ll examine these drivers below. While META has rallied, if you prefer upside with a smoother ride than a single stock, consider the High Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P and delivered >91% returns since inception. Also, see – What's Happening With UNH Stock? Meta’s recent results show accelerating growth across key lines. Q2 2025 revenue reached $47.5 billion, up 22% year over year, and net income climbed 36% to $18.3 billion. Operating leverage is especially visible in advertising, where revenue hit $46.6 billion, a 21.5% increase. The 9% rise in average price per ad underscores Meta’s ability to command premium pricing through AI-enhanced targeting. Also, see – Meta’s Revenue Comparison. Meta’s core shift centers on AI embedded throughout its advertising stack. Llama models now drive ad ranking and content recommendations, marking a move from conventional social media ads to precision marketing. This is not merely a technical upgrade—it is producing tangible business results, with pricing power expanding quarter after quarter. The scale goes well beyond automation. Meta’s generative AI tools are gaining traction with users and advertisers, opening new revenue opportunities while optimizing existing placements. This positions Meta at the forefront of the industry’s transition to AI-powered marketing solutions. Instagram is Meta’s most valuable asset and fastest-growing revenue engine. The platform is on track to generate over half of Meta’s U.S. advertising revenue in 2025, up from just 7% a decade ago. This mix shift toward a higher-margin platform creates substantial room for profitability gains. Given that Meta’s global advertising revenue exceeded $160 billion in 2024, with nearly 40% from North America, international monetization remains a significant opportunity. As Instagram expands globally and rolls out new features, it provides a clear path for sustained revenue growth. Meta’s 2025 capital plans include state-of-the-art AI infrastructure, highlighted by a 5-gigawatt data center and over one million graphics processors. While the upfront spend is sizable, these investments help cement leadership in AI-driven ad optimization. The in-house Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA) program signals a push toward cost efficiency. By replacing older GPU-based servers with custom silicon, Meta can lower long-term infrastructure costs while boosting AI performance—building a durable edge in the AI arms race. Despite cumulative losses exceeding $60 billion since 2020, Reality Labs remains Meta’s largest untapped growth option. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has called 2025 a “pivotal year for the metaverse,” suggesting a potential turn from pure investment to revenue generation. Although the division posted $4.5 billion in Q2 losses, a successful transition could unlock meaningful value. Hardware sales, virtual experiences, and “personal superintelligence” applications could create entirely new revenue streams over time. For Meta to double from here, the company needs consistent revenue growth of 15–20% annually alongside margin expansion. Key levers include using AI to further lift ad performance, scaling generative AI across platforms, monetizing new surfaces like Threads, and enhancing WhatsApp’s business features. Financial scenarios suggest revenue could surpass $265 billion within three years, with earnings nearly doubling from under $24 per share in 2024 to over $45 per share in 2028. Even holding current valuation multiples steady, the stock could exceed $1,300 in three to four years. If investors assign higher multiples on stronger AI execution and profitability, shares could reach $1,500 or more—constituting a true doubling from today’s levels. The biggest challenge is intensifying AI competition. Cost-efficient offerings like DeepSeek raise the question of whether Meta’s large-scale infrastructure will preserve its technological moat. Regulatory scrutiny of social platforms could also restrict data monetization, particularly in Europe and Asia. Macroeconomic risks matter as well. A downturn could weigh on ad budgets across Facebook and Instagram, and higher interest rates may make growth stocks like META less appealing than fixed income. Related – Buy or Fear META Stock? Meta’s path to a potential doubling hinges on successful monetization of its AI investments. Its dominance in social advertising, paired with aggressive AI infrastructure scaling, provides multiple routes to sustained growth. The opportunity is real, but execution risk is elevated as competition intensifies across core markets. For growth-oriented investors comfortable with single-stock volatility, META offers compelling upside. Those seeking steadier exposure to similar themes might prefer diversified options like the High Quality Portfolio, which participates in Meta’s growth story while managing concentration risk through broader exposure.

Boost SEO results with powerful keyword research Written by Leigh McKenzie More of your customers are using AI to research products before they buy. Are you prepared? To put this into perspective: Last year, you might’ve searched “best bed sheets” on Google and scrolled through a few links or a Shopping ad. This year, you’re asking ChatGPT: “I sleep hot and have sensitive skin. Can you recommend some breathable bed sheets that won’t irritate me?” Totally different input. Totally different rules for showing up. AI Search still cares about the fundamentals — content, crawlability, internal links, and high-quality backlinks. But now, your visibility is influenced by more than just your website. AI models reflect the full picture: It’s not just keyword targeting — it’s relevance engineering. Shoutout to Mike King @ iPullRank for coining this term. That’s where AI Search Optimization comes in. In this guide, you’ll learn how to: The future of ecommerce search isn’t about rankings. It’s about being part of the answer. This guide will show you how. Before you do anything, start here: can bots actually see your product content? When people started taking AI tools and chatbots seriously in 2022/23, some site owners turned to blocking their crawlers from accessing their site. But if you block the crawler, it won’t be able to serve your pages in its responses. Unless you actively took the step to block them, you shouldn’t need to do anything here. But it’s still worth verifying there are no lines in your robots.txt file like: The other aspect of crawlability to consider is how you’re serving your content. Because right now, bots from the likes of ChatGPT and Perplexity do not appear to process JavaScript (although Google’s Gemini can). If your content is being loaded dynamically, they’re likely missing it completely. That includes: If it’s not in the raw HTML, LLMs like these can’t see it. And if they can’t see it, you won’t show up in AI-generated product recommendations. To make sure you’re not causing crawling issues here, you first need to understand how your ecommerce platform handles JavaScript. Every platform is different: Next, check your PDPs manually. You can do this by right-clicking and selecting “Inspect” in your browser. Then press Command+Shift+P on Mac, or Control+Shift+P on Windows/Linux. In the Command Menu, start typing “javascript” and then select “Disable JavaScript”: Reload the page, and you’ll see how it looks without JavaScript enabled — in other words, how LLMs like ChatGPT see the page: In the Nike example above, the LLM would still see key info like the product title, description, and price. But in the example below… …it would see nothing. You can see on the right that there’s still page code loading. But nothing is actually displayed to the user with JavaScript disabled. Meaning AI tools wouldn’t be able to pull any info from this page. If you are using apps or components that rely on JavaScript to display key content, talk to your dev team about server-side rendering (SSR) or prerendering. The goal is to ensure all critical product info is delivered in the first HTML response. Further reading: What Is JavaScript SEO? 6 Best Practices to Boost Rankings Once your product pages are crawlable, the next step is making them understandable. Structured data — specifically Schema.org markup in JSON-LD format — helps systems like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google understand what your product is, how much it costs, whether it’s in stock, and more. In the world of SEO, we’ve long used schema markup to improve how our pages appear in traditional search results. Here’s an example of a traditional Google results enhanced with schema markup, appearing as a rich snippets: But for LLM visibility, schema helps the AI tools understand key details about your products. Which makes it easier for them to pull in your products when they’re making recommendations for users. How do we know this? Because Microsoft has told us. The tech giant, a major investor in OpenAI (behind ChatGPT), said: “[Structured data] makes it easier for search engines not only to index your content, but to surface it accurately and richly in search results, shopping experiences, and AI-driven assistants.” (Interestingly, Microsoft/Bing recommends combining this with IndexNow — a service that automatically pings search engines when you update your content.) Plus, using structured data just makes sense — it helps make it easier for complex machines to understand our content. Whether that’s a search engine or an LLM, providing more context is generally always going to be a good idea. Here’s how to use structured data to improve your ecommerce store’s LLM visibility: While there’s value in marking up other templates (like category pages, blog posts, or FAQs), your product pages are where it counts most. This is the data that LLMs and search engines will use to: Here are the fields to include: Use your schema to reflect reality, not just fill fields. But also add as much context as you can. If your product is eco-friendly, US-made, sweatproof — encode it. The better your markup, the more context LLMs have to surface your product in nuanced prompts. Check your schema is valid with tools like: Make sure the schema is present in the raw HTML — not loaded with JavaScript. Once your product markup is solid, consider adding: These all help build context around your product and can influence how LLMs present or recommend it. Once you’ve marked up your product pages, the next step is scaling an effective structure across your entire catalog. That’s where a high-quality product feed comes in. Structured feeds have been essential for Google Shopping, Meta Advantage+, and TikTok Shop for a while. And now, they’re becoming equally important for AI-powered discovery. Especially as platforms like Perplexity and OpenAI build out product recommendation systems. Think of your feed as the dataset LLMs will eventually pull from when answering questions like this: Perplexity has launched a Merchant Program accepting feed uploads, called the Perplexity Merchant Program. This lets ecommerce sellers have even more control over how their products can appear in AI responses. Plus, OpenAI is quietly testing ways to let store owners upload feeds to improve their AI responses for product recommendations. These feeds will likely drive future AI shopping experiences across chat, search, and even voice interfaces. So how do you set your product feeds up in an LLM-friendly way? To optimize your product feeds for AI, start with the essentials: Note: Tools like ChatGPT may still generate their own versions of some of these (like titles). But it’ll still typically use information from places like your product feeds to inform its responses. After you’ve added the basics, layer in high-value fields like: Use the same language your customers use. This means writing product information the way your customers actually talk and search, not how your internal teams or suppliers describe things. For example: Instead of: “Athletic footwear with moisture-wicking synthetic upper” Write: “Running shoes that keep your feet dry” How do you find out how they talk? Look at your customer reviews, support tickets, and search queries that already drive traffic to your store. For example, they might search for “cozy sweater” not “knitted pullover.” This can inform your title and description choices. Here’s how to submit your product feeds for three of the biggest AI interfaces. In 2024, Perplexity launched their Merchant Program. This fuels the platform’s shopping experience for Pro users. Your products may appear in carousel-style answers and shopping-focused prompts, and shoppers can buy without leaving Perplexity. You can find out more about the program and sign up here. OpenAI is piloting product discovery via ChatGPT’s “Search + Product Discovery” initiative. They’re exploring using uploaded feeds to power future buying experiences inside ChatGP. Fill out this interest form to apply. Google’s Merchant Center feeds power Shopping Ads, organic Shopping listings, and likely influence how Google’s AI systems interpret and surface your products in AI Mode and AI Overviews. Once you’ve put all the steps in place to make your ecommerce store crawlable by LLMs, the next step is to make sure they’re actually accessing your content and product pages. Here’s how to do that: Use server logs or your CDN (like Cloudflare, Fastly, or Akamai) to track requests from: For each of these bots, track: This helps confirm they’re discovering your content and gives you a baseline to measure progress. Keyword research is still important. But you also need to think about how your customers are likely to prompt AI tools when looking for products like yours. LLMs answer questions, interpret context, and make recommendations based on how people naturally speak. That means you need to rethink how you optimize for product discovery. Not by keywords alone, but by personas, use cases, and prompt formats. Your best-performing SEO and paid search keywords are still the foundation. They tell you: Use these to anchor your prompt strategy — but expand outward. As people become more savvy with how AI tools work, more and more shoppers are going beyond just typing in “best bed sheets.” They’re asking: Medium-length prompts: Longer, context-rich prompts: Your goal is to build context around your products that lines up with this kind of language and framing. Note: You can’t predict exactly what your customers will ask, and there are infinite ways they can do it. But thinking about prompts — not just keywords — will put you in a good place to be able to optimize your ecommerce pages for LLMs. Think in layers: This is how you start to think of your items like answers and solutions, not just products. Let this prompt structure inform your: LLMs can pull from all of it — so make sure you’re using the kind of language your real customers use everywhere. Even if your site is crawlable, your schema is perfect, and your feed is super optimized — LLMs still learn about your brand based on what people are saying about you elsewhere. They’re trained on massive web-scale datasets, so third-party content — like reviews, Reddit mentions, YouTube transcripts, forums, blog posts — can carry as much (or more) weight than your owned channels. If you want to show up in AI answers, your brand needs to already exist in the wider conversation. AI tools like ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Claude all lean on third-party review sites and forums in their answers to brand and product-related queries. These are the places you’ll want to show up in order to be included in those answers: Showing up in these places is half the battle. The other component is how you show up. Ideally, you’ll want to be mentioned alongside competitors (“like Brooklinen but…”). And in the right, relevant context (“these are some of the best cooling sheets for eczema”). A lot of this is going to be completely out of your control (especially on platforms like Reddit). But good marketing practices can make it more likely that people will naturally talk about your brand in the way you want them to. Gaining LLM visibility is a byproduct of an effective multichannel marketing strategy. If you’re running a strong content program, building brand awareness, and actively participating in your category — you’re already seeding relevance. What’s new is the urgency: LLMs are already using these signals to decide which brands deserve to be recommended. Related: See our LLM Seeding Playbook for tactics, templates, and outreach strategies. In traditional SEO, visibility was deterministic: rank #1 for a keyword, get X% of clicks. That model is breaking. AI-powered discovery works differently. Your brand might appear in one version of a response, but not the next. Whether your ecommerce store is included depends on how the user phrases their prompt, how much brand recognition you have, and how often you’re referenced across the web. So, your measurement strategy needs to adapt. Start by building a prompt library — real questions your customers might ask: Here’s how it looks in Semrush’s AI SEO Toolkit: For each prompt, ask: Over time, this gives you a clearer picture of how visible your brand is across different use cases. AI-driven search is already reshaping how people discover products. The shift is subtle now, but it won’t stay that way for long. What used to be a clear SEO vs. paid search strategy is now blending into a broader question: When someone asks a smart machine what to buy… will it know you exist? This guide gave you a playbook to start answering that question: It’s a lot. But the good news? If you’ve already invested in great products, strong messaging, and a multi-channel strategy, you’re not starting from scratch. Still need help nailing the fundamentals?

Title: The 100 Best Movies of the 1970s

This site is protected by reCAPTCHA Enterprise and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply. Listing the best movies of a given decade has become something of an IndieWire tradition over the last few years, starting with the countdown we put together for our ’90s Week extravaganza in 2022, continuing with the ’80s the following year, and… then abruptly jumping forward in time to the ’00s the year after that. The problem wasn’t that we don’t love ’70s cinema — the problem was that we love ’70s cinema way too much. And way too much of it. The prospect of putting together a top 100 list that still didn’t have room for the likes of “M*A*S*H,” “Brewster McCloud,” The Long Goodbye,” or “California Split” seemed deeply perverse, and that’s just accounting for the work of a single filmmaker. No “Close Encounters of the Third Kind”? No “That Obscure Object of Desire”? No “House,” “Holy Mountain,” or “Half a Loaf of Kung Fu”!? It’s hard to even see the point of trying, and some of you might find it that much harder after parsing the movies that ultimately made the cut now that we’ve finally decided to wrap our hands around one of the most vital — and turbulent — decades the movies have known thus far. Born from the chaos of the 1960s and screaming headlong into a future that still seemed to be up for grabs (even as fears, optimistically dubbed “paranoid,” began to deepen about the powers that really hold this planet in their grip), the films of the ’70s reflect a world that was trying to make sense of its own violent potential. It was a time of ecstatic creativity that saw the emergence of New Hollywood, blaxploitation, and a blockbuster culture that was more compelled by greatness than opening weekend grosses; that saw American cinema look up to the stars with one eye and back down towards its own past with the other. It was also a time of profound reckoning, as established giants like Med Hondo, Nagisa Ōshima, and Pier Paolo Pasolini confronted the rot of history with a clarity and fearlessness that has seldom been seen since. And perhaps more than anything else, it was a time of cocaine. Just incredible amounts of cocaine. In a decade whose movies were so vast and varied, cocaine might be the only thing that many of the ones on this list ultimately have in common. Cocaine and Al Pacino. So after much consternation we present to you, at last, IndieWire’s list of the 100 Best Movies of the 1970s. This article includes contributions from: Carlos Aguilar, Christian Blauvelt, Sam Bodrojan, Wilson Chapman, Jake Cole, Rance Collins, David Ehrlich, Kate Erbland, Alison Foreman, Proma Khosla, Ryan Lattanzio, Vikram Murthi, Tambay Obenson, Katie Rife, and Christian Zilko. IndieWire’s ‘70s Week is presented by Bleecker Street’s “RELAY.” Riz Ahmed plays a world class “fixer” who specializes in brokering lucrative payoffs between corrupt corporations and the individuals who threaten their ruin. IndieWire calls “RELAY” “sharp, fun, and smartly entertaining from its first scene to its final twist, ‘RELAY’ is a modern paranoid thriller that harkens back to the genre’s ’70s heyday.” From director David Mackenzie (“Hell or High Water”) and also starring Lily James, in theaters August 22. A film like “The Sugarland Express” is proof that some legends are just built different. Directing his first theatrically released film at 28 years old, Steven Spielberg practically emerged from the womb with all of the characteristics that would make him the biggest Hollywood director of the next half century: the effortless command of spectacle that always knows when to take a backseat to storytelling, the buttery smooth camera movements that seamlessly shift focus without ever letting viewers know it’s happening, and his unapologetic sincerity and deep belief in the dreams of brighter days that Hollywood has always sold us. Many a modern viewer has watched “The Sugarland Express” expecting a trail of breadcrumbs that point to the development of a more mature Spielberg who directed his best films, but its pleasures are more immediate than that — “The Sugarland Express” is one of his best films, full stop. In Goldie Hawn’s Lou Jean, a young mom who will stop at nothing to get her baby out of the foster system, Spielberg found one of his most endearing protagonists. Her endless love, refusal to accept defeat, and good humor about the ridiculousness of riding in a cop convoy while holding an officer at gunpoint makes the character impossible to root against, and Spielberg is often happy to sit back and let Hawn’s charisma do all the hard work for him. “The Sugarland Express” is Spielberg at his funniest and most sincere, complete with stellar car chase sequences that foreshadow his blockbuster dominance, and beautiful shots of characters watching “Looney Tunes” that may well have laid the foundation for Sammy Fabelman’s eventual trips to the movies. Its legacy has been overshadowed by the colossal movies its director has made in the subsequent decades, but the film would be just as deserving of a spot on this list if Spielberg had never stepped behind the camera again. —CZ Agnès Varda’s “One Sings, the Other Doesn’t” is a musical about women’s rights, at once both polemical in its borderline-Brechtian lyrics championing birth control and body autonomy, and also eternally playful and inquisitive in the naturalistic study of its central duo’s friendship over many years. Classmates Pauline and Suzanne drift together and apart through the vagaries of life, each following a wildly different path but always retaining a connection to the other. Among other things, it is one of the most gently observed movies ever made about female friendship. One of Varda’s boldest experiments, the film blends various genres and styles. Inspired by a real abortion case, the film incorporates neorealist traits to the extent it casts one of the actual lawyers to recreate the court proceedings, but Varda also sidesteps into gorgeous tableaux vivants and adopts immersive editing patterns to convey the characters’ sense of time passing. And the occasional bursts of song add a dash of whimsy to topics the director takes seriously, using humor and warmth to bring into the open subjects that were still largely taboo in French society. —JC In a way, Edward Anhalt and John Milius’s script for “Jeremiah Johnson” crystallizes what Westerns have been chasing ever since: It’s spare, unfussy, and full of poetic character. But for all the ways in which “Jeremiah Johnson” has proven enduring and influential, this under-appreciated classic is a truly singular film at heart — a portrait of a true ‘70s loner who just happens to be living in the Rocky Mountains in the 1840s. Drawing inspiration from period vernacular and the poetry of Carl Sandburg, Anhalt and Milius’s script is laser-focused on the search for what really matters in life, and the search that happens within oneself. Director Sydney Pollack, proving his extraordinary range and gifts, opened himself up as well to find this movie in the edit, a seven-and-a-half month assembly process following a shoot all over the snowy wilds of Redford’s adopted state of Utah. Far more than “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,” “Jeremiah Johnson” is the real birth of Sundance — many of the landscapes here seem just a stone’s throw from Main Street in Park City. The result is both purposeful in the writing and loose enough to let in a real feeling of life, the kind of experiential rhythm that you can’t find in a studio. This is as quiet and most introspective as Westerns get. It also has one of the ultimate ‘70s cinematic moments, an instant that sums up the spirit of the decade onscreen better than maybe any other bit of dialogue. While those opposed to the Vietnam War burned their draft cards, Jeremiah Johnson deserts the army altogether, who were then fighting the Mexican War. Sometime after his abandonment of the fight he encounters a patrol of soldiers and asks if the war is still going. So much time has passed that the patrol’s officer isn’t sure which war he means. “The war against the president of Mexico,” Jeremiah clarifies. “It’s over!” comes the response. So then Jeremiah asks, his tone of voice perfectly calibrated to convey a mix of mild curiosity and ultimate indifference: “Who won?” —CB One of the great Upper East Side movies, Paul Mazursky’s feminist romantic dramedy “An Unmarried Woman” is also one of the most emotionally intelligent American movies of the 1970s: The story of Erica Benton (Jill Clayburgh), who must come to terms with her husband (Michael Murphy) leaving her for another, what-else-but much younger woman, and set out on the healing and hopeful path to reclaiming herself later in life. (While Clayburgh was in her mid-30s when Mazursky shot the movie, something about her feels older, wiser.) But “An Unmarried Woman” is also a sharp feminist text and richly lived-in-feeling portrait of New York City life. Clayburgh’s superb performance, which was Best Actress-nominated at the 1979 Academy Awards after winning that prize at the 1978 Cannes Film Festival, has a deft and deceptive lightness that gives Erica a sort of floating-through-life, almost gossamer quality that makes her at times tricky to read (and so therefore more fascinating to watch). It’s also extremely cathartic for the audience. Though Erica, an art dealer, eventually gets acquainted with Alan Bates as an abstract painter, “An Unmarried Woman” isn’t a romantic comedy in search of a match for its leading character. It’s a more naturalistic, minor-key character study that feels closer in spirit to an indie, landing on a great punchline of an ending as Erica trudges with a giant oversized painting in her arms down the streets of SoHo, a painting given to her by Bates’ artist. That Erica refuses to settle for an alternate relationship is what makes the empowering “An Unmarried Woman” so remarkable and even groundbreaking today. But just imagine that take in the 1970s, barely a few years into Women’s Liberation. —RL In the cinema of Jean-Marie Straub and Danièle Huillet, “The body keeps the score” is as true of the Earth itself as any human who trods upon it. Wielding a style of punishing austerity achieved through meticulous composition, movement, and editing, the filmmakers arrived at a singular meeting point between the classicism of John Ford and Charlie Chaplin and the avant-garde modernism of Robert Bresson and Bertolt Brecht. “From the Clouds to the Resistance” is one of the finest displays of their oeuvre, a testament to human struggle against oppressors ranging from ancient Greco-Roman myths of defying the gods all the way up to the antifascist resistances of the 1940s. Beneath its deliberately anti-dramatic surface of long takes and unemotional delivery of declamatory dialogue, the film communicates with lyrical beauty. Tree branches are used as proscenia to theatrically encase actors, and eyeline matches subtly establish power dynamics between their characters. Small fluctuations in natural light hint at shifts in those dynamics as one person or another asserts will against the other, and multi-planar compositions of landscape evoke painters like Cézanne while also silently testifying to the incalculable gallons of blood spilled on hills and dales over the course of human history and its endless wars. And for all the filmmakers’ Brechtian distance, they ultimately present a deeply human thesis of the capacity to endure and oppose even the harshest regimes of control. —JC Politically incisive director Lindsay Anderson found in Malcolm McDowell a wide-eyed and peculiar vessel to examine the economic inequities and ideologically corrosive nature of post-war British capitalism. Here, in the picaresque second film of their Mick Travis trilogy, McDowell embodies the perpetually cheerful lad as a coffee seller whose ambition and disposition earns him a rare upward mobility. As Mick travels across the U.K.’s northeast selling his unethically sourced product, his quick ascent and eventual downfall is interspersed with Alan Price’s musical performances. With lyrics like “Sell everything you stand for” or “Someone’s got to win in the human race/ If it isn’t you, then it has to be me,” the tracks are far from conspicuous, but their inclusion lends a cheeky undertone to a film that’s brimming with latent darkness. Anderson and screenwriter David Sherwin insert Travis’ evolution from idealism to disillusionment into the larger context of the Britain’s blood-soaked imperial past and its enduring consequences. As Travis becomes aware he’s just a disposable pawn, susceptible and perhaps even powerless to the whims of a system designed to chew him up and spit him out, McDowell’s expression turns from curious to utterly defeated. The character’s “luck” has ultimately run out. —CA Chris Marker’s three-hour ciné-essay takes a look over the preceding decade of global leftist movements and their various failures, from the student protests across the west to pushes in Soviet states for greater autonomy from Moscow. It is the latter that often proves the most compelling material for how little it has been covered in the west; in one of the film’s most transfixing sequences, Marker plays footage of Fidel Castro publicly declaring support for the Soviet Union’s invasion of Czechoslovakia to repress protests, lingering on the Cuban leader’s ambiguous expression for hints of self-awareness at betraying the higher ideals of revolution for self-determination. Marker’s pioneering form of half-studious, half-associative history has arguably become more relevant in recent years than it ever was during his lifetime, a clear forerunner to an entire genre of video content devoted to obsessive exegeses of politics and pop culture. Adam Curtis in particular is inconceivable without this film, but Marker’s overriding sense of play avoids the pitfalls of conspiratorial frenzy that besets so many of his successors. —JC Lino Brocka’s 1975 genre-bending fable is so dexterous an affair that you’d be forgiven for accidentally underselling it. It is a queer melodrama, a sociological survey of Marcos-era Filipino life, and a rollicking mystery. Without ever dulling the film’s gritty, anti-colonialist messaging, “Manila in the Claws of Light” remains prime entertainment. It feels miraculous that the film even exists in the first place — that Brocka did this, in front of a camera, with this many people, that it looks this good, and that it released to international success. Yet none of the aforementioned qualities are what lingers most vividly between individual viewings. The most striking aspect of the film is the infrastructure: The dirt piles next to a construction site, the market stalls built from sheet metal, the hand-painted menus at a restaurant. Brocka’s camera focuses so intently on these spaces because of he cares so passionately for the people whose spirit threaten to be crushed by merely inhabiting them. When I think about “Manila in the Claws of Light,” this is what first comes to mind. —SB In 1973, the Japanese equivalent of Walt Disney decided to adapt a 19th century book about the feminist history of witchcraft into an animated prog-rock musical about a medieval peasant girl who gets gang-raped on her wedding night and then turns to Satan for help with her revenge. This is really a thing that happened. See it even once and you’ll never forget that it did. Strange even by the psychedelic standards of its time, Eiichi Yamamoto’s wild and exhausting “Belladonna of Sadness” is a sinister anime fairytale inspired by the same fetish for medievalism that gripped Jacques Demy and Pier Paolo Pasolini, layered in recursive prog-rock jams, and filled with enough vaginal imagery to make Georgia O’Keeffe blush. From that imagery erupts the film’s vivid approach to sexual violence, as the heroine’s assault is symbolized by the sight of her naked body being cleaved in two down the middle like a butchered animal carcass, blood flying out of wound in the form of bats that flap off into oblivion. Few movies have ever so viscerally depicted the psychic toll of such trauma — the crime’s power to tear a person apart from themselves. Smarter than it is salacious, the film’s narrative complements its Eurocentric art style, further distancing “Belladonna of Sadness” from the world of hentai and locating it instead in a Western history where women are positioned as angels of liberty, and witchcraft their way of rebelling against institutional misogyny. History has a habit of prizing women for their sexuality one minute and punishing them for it the next, and Yamamoto’s film reflects that dynamic down to its core. This is a story about men who are in the thrall of a woman’s beauty, and then enraged by their inability to control it. It continues to prove moving, even in its (budget-enforced) stillness. —DE A tumbleweed-like tour across a broken country that’s trying to get back on its feet as the horrors of the Vietnam War come to a close, Jerry Schatzberg’s painfully unforgiving “Scarecrow” is a story about two drifters who give each other a sense of direction even though neither of them has anywhere left to go. Max Millan (Gene Hackman) is a short-tempered ex-con who looks askance at everyone he meets. Frances Lionel “Lion” Delbuchi (Al Pacino) is a stunted and guileless former sailor who dreams of reconnecting with his ex in Pittsburgh — and of becoming a father to the child he’s never met. These odd vagabonds make for a strained and unlikely pair of friends, but Lion’s puppy dog naivete turns out to be the perfect counterweight to Max’s cynicism, and it isn’t long before these two men are supporting each other in a way that no one else ever has. Shadowed by a deep and implacable darkness from the moment it starts, “Scarecrow” endures — and even offers its own strange kind of comfort — because of the lightning-in-a-bottle frisson it captures between its lead characters, whose tetchy dynamic was reflected in the conflicting styles of the actors who played them. Hackman’s introspective reserve clashed with Pacino’s method immersion, and though both actors were at the height of their powers, it took all of their combined talent to make it through a scene without snapping. That barely contained explosiveness lends an extra poignancy to the strength that Max and Lion give to and take from each other; it builds and builds until the point where their friendship starts to seem like it could point towards true north in a world that’s lost its moral compass. Alas, it leads them somewhere else in the end, as “Scarecrow” resolves as an indelibly American reminder that moving forward isn’t as simple as finding a way to get there. —DE Robert Bresson shook up his image as an imposing, aesthetically spartan moralist “Four Nights of a Dreamer,” which unmoors his usually materialist cinema into the realm of fantasia. Inspired by Dostoevsky’s short story, “White Nights,” the film follows the relationship that forms between a suicidal young woman and the stranger who attempts to convince her to live. Bresson retains his economy of storytelling to capture the caution with which both people open up to each other, but elsewhere he indulges in the most delicate and effervescent camera work of his career. At times, the film verges on comedy, if not outright self-parody. In a brief film-within-the-film moment, Bresson renders the bare plot as a quasi-thriller as if to show he could make more traditionally crowd-pleasing fare if he wished, and he reworks the ending of the source story as a bleakly funny punchline on the smitten protagonist’s presumption of possible romance with his rescued damsel. And yet, the underlying interest of Bresson’s filmography — the elusive search for truth in any of its forms — is as present here as his more feted works. For Bresson, the “meet-cute” becomes a means of unpacking the entire spiritual possibilities of love. —JC When talking about ‘70s culture, words like “paranoid” and “anti-establishment” loom so heavily in the air that it’s easy to lose sight of their meaning and use them exclusively as aesthetic descriptors. But even after 50 years, a film like “Dog Day Afternoon” makes it impossible to reduce the social unrest it depicts to grooming choices and editing styles. No amount of philosophizing disgrace and criticizing fears could convince a viewer that the society Sydney Lumet depicts isn’t on the brink of collapse — or, at the very least, isn’t convinced of its own imminent downfall. Even by the comparably low standards of the antihero-loving ‘70s, Sonny Worzik is not the kind of hero that a healthy civilization turns its eyes to in times of need. A chaos agent with all the poise of a chainsaw juggler in their first day on the job, his impulsive bank robbery devolves into a hostage situation in the blink of an eye. Fueled by little more than a deep belief that nobody’s promises are worth the paper they’re printed on, his make-things-up-as-he-goes approach to negotiation is the work of a man who feels so utterly invisible that he’ll settle for making enough noise to be noticed. On a technical narrative level, “Dog Day Afternoon” is as gripping a thriller as they come. As a social artifact, it’s one of the definitive examples of the chaos that was seeping into every crack of the American consciousness. Sonny only gains momentum from his admirers as he invokes the Attica prison riots, cultivating the crowd’s anger into a collective demand to see someone, anyone, do something to upset the powers that be. It’s all futile, as there’s only one way that a movie like this can end, but few films have ever reflected that futility with so much fire. —CZ Nicolas Roeg’s “Walkabout” was only the British director’s second feature after 1970’s “Performance” heralded him as an independent moviemaker to watch — and one with a special predilection for unique cross-cutting that felt like a fascinating new riff on the French New Wave. With one of the decade’s most indelible prologues, his film thrusts us into the arid wilds of the Australian Outback, where two English schoolchildren (played by Jenny Agutter and Luc Roeg, the director’s son) are unceremoniously dumped by their depressed father after he tries to kill them, and only ends up killing himself. At the same time, their paths as they try to survive in the desert collide with a Black Aboriginal boy (David Gulpilil, who went on to have a huge film career of his own after this breakout debut) who is on the rite-of-passage journey of which the title gets its name. Still streaked by Roeg’s nihilistic worldview despite the potentially heartwarming center, the unsentimental and briskly told “Walkabout” is also a brutal and unsparing portrait of survival in the wilderness. And speaking of cross-cutting, it’s perhaps most famous for a scene in which Agutter is seen swimming naked, juxtaposed against Gulpilil mercilessly hunting down Outback wildlife. “Walkabout” is a movie all about juxtapositions — man vs. nature, the modern vs. the ancient, the landscape vs. the colonial human forces cutting into and against it. But the tenuous bond that forms between the siblings and the boy, who doesn’t speak a lick of the English language, suggests in cinematic terms how those opposing forces ultimately could (and should) coexist. —RL Akio Jissoji careened from the populist Japanese TV of “Ultraman” to the heights of the nation’s avant-garde with this, the first of a trio of films inspired by Buddhist philosophy. Setting up a morality play in which a monastery attempts to intervene in a local case of youthful sexual indiscretion prove disastrous, the film pivots almost instantly into an abstract self-examination of human contradictions that mingles Middle Path precepts with Marxist dialectics. Not unlike the films of John Cassavetes, “This Transient Life” uses manic theatricality as a means of unpacking subtle emotional complexity, finding grounded and relatable foibles in garish extremes. Throughout, Jissoji puts his camera everywhere except where you’d expect it to be, capturing the drama in de-centered, wide-angled frames that only exacerbate the feeling of the characters being distorted and magnified for study. Rarely has the notion of characters being put under a microscope felt more literally true. —JC Barbet Schroeder’s remarkable documentary was billed as a “self-portrait” for good reason. Uganda’s brutally despotic then-president, Idi Amin, agreed to be filmed on his own terms, confident in how he wanted to be seen. Schroeder let him perform for the camera with minimal intervention, which represented a seismic directorial choice unto itself. “General Idi Amin Dada: A Self-Portrait” doesn’t analyze Amin’s power — it lets us see how power presents itself. What results is both document and spectacle: a record of one man’s delusion, and a warning about how easily image can replace truth. Nearly 50 years later, it still disturbs by showing what happens when control of the camera becomes part of the performance. —TO Akira Kurosawa was so disheartened by the failure of 1970’s Gorky-esque “Dodes’ka-den” that he tried taking his own life. Despite surviving the attempt, Kurosawa was still resigned to the fact that he was unlikely to receive funding ever again. So when the 63-year-old auteur was approached by the Soviet film studio Mosfilm to spend almost two years in the taiga adapting Vladimir Arsenyev’s epic novel “Dersu Uzala” (a book that he had supposedly been fascinated by since the earliest days of his career), Kurosawa wasn’t exactly in a position to say no. The resulting film turned a profit, won an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, and allowed the “Seven Samurai” director to keep working for another 18 years — a period that saw the creation of the late-career masterpieces “Kagemusha” and “Ran.” But here’s the thing: “Dersu Uzala” is as great as those films — as raw and ravishing as anything Kurosawa ever made. Nature had always played an ambient role in his films, but here, in the story of a czarist expedition to the extremes of Russia’s Far East in the early 20th century, it would become the director’s primary subject. The heart of the story is the growing friendship between the leader of the expedition and a Goldi (or Nanai) hunter named Dersu Uzala who serves as their guide. A number of set pieces stand out, most of all the wildfire that consumes a wheat field, which is given extra dimension by the faded otherworldliness of SovColor — Kurosawa would later pay more explicit tribute to Van Gogh in “Dreams,” but this is the movie of his that most resembles one of the Dutch master’s paintings. A committed leftist his whole life, Kurosawa also found in this story one of cinema’s most profound explorations of colonialism and the impossibility of indigenous people continuing their way of life untrammeled by imperial forces. The animist Goldi believe that nothing can truly be owned, that everything living has a spirit, whereas the Russian forces maintain that everything can quantified and acquired. The tragedy sparked from those two conflicting perspectives is every bit as haunting today as it was 50 years ago. —CB The ‘70s were the decade when cinema was formally established as a field worthy of academic study, and one of the things that was regularly discussed in university film classes was the attempt at finding “a new language for film.” Traditionalist Luchino Visconti was in pursuit of the same with his adaptation of Thomas Mann’s “Death in Venice,” which sees newly widowed Mahler stand-in Gustav von Aschenbach journey to the Lido for “absolute rest.” As Dirk Bogarde’s ailing composer silently takes in the sights on his Italian vacation, Visconti delivers a portrait of subjectivity as potent as “Rear Window,” and with similarly radical sound design. Dialogue seamlessly overlaps with ambient noise as Gustav quietly observes the world against his ever-diminishing place in it, but that languid sense of despair is soon interrupted by the sight of Tadzio (Bjorn Andresen), a beautiful Polish teenager who becomes Gustav’s all-consuming obsession. Is Gustav’s fixation predatory, or is it simply that the boy personifies the lost possibilities of the older man’s life? Something to puzzle over. Until that central relationship is established (for his part, Tadzio barely notices the existence of Gustav at all), “Death in Venice” is comfortable to exist in the liminal space between the gorgeousness of its setting and the dread of its protagonist’s anxiety. It’s filmmaking to get lost in, and the ultimate apotheosis of Italian cinema’s inward shift away from Fellini-esque expressionism. Taken in the context of Visconti’s filmography, “Death in Venice” feels like a radical departure from the operatic eruptions of “Rocco and His Brothers.” It’s a film where slight glances, whispered introductions, and the silent offer of an outstretched hand are rich enough to signify the world entire. —CB Made fearlessly just a few years after the 1968 student protests in Mexico City, which resulted in numerous deaths at the hands of the government, Felipe Cazals’ searing indictment of how propaganda can incite a herd mentality — and result in deadly violence — remains as potent as it was when first released. The pioneering filmmaker structured his defiant narrative partially as a fake documentary featuring interviews with actors playing residents of the small rural town of San Miguel Canoa. Their accounts often clash with what we learn happened one night after the malevolent local priest, played with chilling nonchalance by Enrique Lucero, convinces the impoverished residents that a group of young men forced to stay the night in town due to torrential rain are students who’ve arrived to threaten their faith. Without proof of these claims other than the word from the man of the cloth (who operates with ulterior motives), the virulent mob unleash brutality on the visitors — who are in fact university workers, and not pupils. A cautionary tale about the perils of pervasive repression, “Canoa” endures as one of the darkest and most knowing films of its kind. —CA The complaint that they don’t make movies like they used to is as cliched as it is eternal, but watching “The Heartbreak Kid” in 2025 is a quick way to remind yourself how true it really is. The existence of a major studio release centered around a reprehensible man who starts an affair on his honeymoon — and then proceeds to meander through a slow-paced journey in which he learns nothing before the movie fizzles out with a whimper — would be unthinkable in any era except the New Hollywood of the 1970s. And yet, anyone lucky enough to track down a copy of this semi-lost classic can attest that it still holds up as one of the driest, funniest movies of the 20th century. Charles Grodin’s Lenny Cantrow is a man without a single redeeming quality, a smarmy sporting goods salesman who radiates so much selfishness that every institution holding polite society together seemingly dissolves in his presence. To be fair, nobody around him is that great either. His first wife Lila (Jeannie Berlin) is hopelessly naive and needy, falling for Lenny’s tricks for far longer than she should, even if their relationship barely lasts a week. And his second target, Cybill Shepherd’s Kelly Corcoran (because of course, a girl like that would have a name like Kelly Corcoran), is all too happy to let a newlywed man pursue her, seemingly only for the fleeting pleasure of the attention he provides. The only character with any redeeming qualities is her overbearing father who forbids her from dating Lenny. He’s the kind of cheap stock character who normally serves as an antagonist to be defeated in most romances, but the only person thinking clearly in this sick sad world, which should tell you everything you need to know about the morality we’re dealing with here.The all-star pairing of writer Neil Simon and director Elaine May renders the story with an appropriately unsympathetic gaze. Lenny barrels through the world spewing self-serving bullshit as he chases shiny object after shiny object, hurting everyone in his path who falls for it and leaving the few outsiders who see through him to shake their heads in disgust. “The Heartbreak Kid” is often labeled a satire of marriage, but that’s only a half-truth. May and Simon take a neutral stance on the practice itself, but make it clear that some of us are far too narcissistic to deserve it. And the film’s brilliantly abrupt ending illustrates that there’s no other institution that could successfully take its place, because the real problems lie within us, not the cauliflower. —CZ It’s hard to argue that Lau Kar Leung’s “Heroes of the East” is the best of the Shaw Brothers classics that came out of Hong Kong during the 1970s, as the decade’s — and the century’s — quintessential martial-arts studio simply produced too many immortal beat-em-ups for there to be a definitive standout. Nevertheless, this ultra-kinetic relationship comedy about the arranged marriage between a rich Chinese kung fu student (the great Gordon Liu as Ho Tao) and a deceptively meek Japanese woman (Yuka Mizuno as Yumiko) serves as the perfect stand-in for an entire golden age on a list like this one. Not only does “Heroes of the East” highlight a wide, wide variety of the fighting styles that were showcased across the Shaw Brothers’ filmography, and not only does it provide the most dynamic showcase for one of the studio’s greatest stars, but it also epitomizes how fluently these movies bent combat into a hyper-eloquent form of communication unto itself. In this case, that communication expresses a fierce cross-cultural rivalry between Chinese and Japanese styles — comedically at first, and then with growing intensity as a legion of masters from the land of the rising sun travel to Shanghai to prove that Ho Tao is unworthy of Yumiko’s hand. Scored by a symphony of chop! pow! sound effects, each duel is a discrete masterpiece of old school kung-fu choreography, and they build on one another in a way that turns the entire second half of the movie into an extended crescendo of balletic ass-kicking, the grand finale of which is made all the more satisfying by the respect Lau pays to both of the countries involved. —DE Ousmane Sembène’s “Ceddo” offers a vivid and exceptionally complex look at the nascent days of Senegal’s European colonization, but the actual time period covered by the events of the film is never firmly established. “I can’t give a date,” Sembène said when presented the question. “These events occurred in the 18th and 19th century, and are still occurring.” A Wolof-speaking people face a crossroads: Their king wants to ally with the Islamic forces that have been exerting a growing influence on their country, which would later become the modern-day nation of Senegal. The “Ceddo,” outsiders who refuse to be colonized by either Muslims or Christians, kidnap the king’s daughter as ransom to ensure that he turns away from Islam. Violence ensues. Western cinema is prone to stories of privileged male characters being marooned with their enemies, only to find shared values and common cause along the way. With history on its side, “Ceddo” inverts that hero’s journey, as it’s the king’s daughter Dior (Tabata Ndiaye) who finds a new perspective among the outsiders and ultimately fights against her father — a painful but rousing struggle that highlights the eternal war against cultural usurpation, and the crucial role that women must be allowed to play in that fight. —CB A soft but sexually charged drama against the stunning alpine backdrop of Lake Annecy over the course of a summer month, Éric Rohmer’s “Claire’s Knee” initially resembles what a hater of French arthouse cinema probably thinks all of the nation’s films are about. Its story tells of a middle-aged man named Jérôme (Jean-Claude Brialy) whose recent engagement has done nothing to slow his lust for other women. He develops a romantic interest in two underage girls as part of what can only be described an esoteric wager he makes while discussing sex and monogamy with a novelist friend (Aurora Cornu). When he learns that the younger of the two girls is in love with him, he makes a move on her out of recreation as much as anything else, only to be shot down because she doesn’t believe he truly loves her. He then turns his attention to her step-sister, forming an obsession with her knee that consumes his thoughts. But no plot summaries could ever hope to do the film justice, as “Claire’s Knee” has less to do with any individual human relationship than our remarkable ability to rationalize our desires and misdeeds. Jérôme never gets a chance to consummate his lust for Claire — nor, it could be argued, does he really want to. Instead, Rohmer masterfully illustrates the way possession and attainability (or the lack thereof) are inextricably tied to our desires. Every interaction is so profoundly overanalyzed and overcomplicated that it’s a miracle anyone has any fun at all on this miserable trip. The real lesson might be that when there’s a void of activity on a summer vacation, humans will naturally move to fill it. The lewd premise builds to the most chaste of climaxes, with Jérôme talking himself into being content with an utterly mundane (if sinisterly motivated) interaction. Because, despite all of its stunning scenery, “Claire’s Knee” is a film that takes place entirely inside its characters’ minds, with the mental gymnastics they perform to assign meaning to all of their endeavors taking precedence over the endeavors themselves. It’s one of the finest examples of Rohmer’s brand of cinema about destructively intellectual characters, and stands alongside “My Night at Maud’s” as one of his finest “Moral Tales.” —CZ Rainer Werner Fassbinder left behind a body of work that struck a precarious yet remarkably sturdy balance of experimental theater, postwar radicalism, and classical Hollywood melodrama, and “Ali: Fear Eats the Soul” is one of the great showcases of his malleability. Reworking the age-gap romantic yearning of Douglas Sirk’s “All That Heaven Allows” around the additional complication of race, Fassbinder brings together lonely, widowed empty-nester Emmi (Brigitte Mira) and hale young Moroccan immigrant Ali (El Hedi ben Salem) as an unlikely couple who rapidly developing affection faces constant tests from disapproving friends, relatives, and sneering passers-by. Fassbinder filters Sirk’s florid, intimate approach to melodrama through his own eerily pristine, at times ironically detached style. He frequently lenses in long shots that convey not the emotions between the couple but the icy, judgmental stares of others who watch them with revulsion. The film also highlights the way in which even the most obviously disapproving people will still put on a facade of cordiality that only makes their disdain sharper. There are also reminders of Germany’s grim recent history, as when Emmi takes Ali to an upscale restaurant to celebrate their elopement and reflexively boasts “Hitler used to eat here!” As both she and Ali feel the pressure from their loved ones to end their relationship, the emotions held at arm’s length eventually explode, leading to perhaps the most visceral ending of Fassbinder’s vast canon. —JC An obstinate seeker who hadn’t been able to finish any of the films he’d started, Errol Morris was on the verge of turning 30 when he stumbled upon a San Francisco Chronicle headline that read: “450 DEAD PETS GOING TO NAPA VALLEY.” Armed with new resolve, he gathered money from friends and family to closely investigate the story in the spring and summer of 1977. His friend, Werner Herzog, famously pledged to eat a shoe if the film was ever finished and exhibited. Though it technically explores pet cemeteries, “Gates of Heaven” isn’t much considered with its ostensible raison d’être. Morris uses pets, death, and small businesses as a lens to consider people’s voices: the manner in which they speak, the narratives they construct about themselves, the yarns they spin. The young director bent cinema vérité to his will by eschewing the de rigueur handheld style of the era in favor of a static camera and direct address. Morris’s locked-off medium shots not only called attention to his highly composed framing, but they also had the hypnotic effect of drawing audiences closer to his subjects as they wax (or drawl) poetic (or comical) about everything under the sun. When Morris screened “Gates of Heaven” for his idol Douglas Sirk at the Berlin Film Festival, he walked out halfway through, calling the film a slideshow. It’s easy to see how he arrived at such a conclusion, and, possibly heeding the filmmaker’s criticism, Morris would never deploy such stillness again in his career. But only the most stubbornly dogmatic viewer could ignore the cinematic spirit animating the director’s photographic compositions. Sirk also cautioned Morris about his film’s supposedly ironic pose, a humorous note considering how frequently the master of melodrama utilized irony in his own work. While Morris certainly mines comedy from his subjects’s eccentricities or quirks of speech, anyone who believes that he made “Gates of Heaven” as an exercise in mockery simply isn’t paying attention. Morris’s permissive interviewing strategy, which entails getting his subjects to speak for as long as possible without much intervention, doesn’t merely facilitate open communication. It’s also a sign of unencumbered respect for their worldviews. Take, for example, Florence Rasmussen, an elderly woman who lives across the street from one of the two pet cemeteries the film examines. She delivers an uninterrupted five-minute monologue about her life while sitting in her front doorway. Circuitous and contradictory, and gloriously “off topic,” her speech exemplifies Morris’s attentive approach: if you just let people talk, they’ll reveal the world. —VM A father has raised his children without contact with the outside world, and their lifelong isolation has warped their understanding of social norms. Yet the older they get, the more they question what’s beyond the walls that ostensibly cage them for their protection. The description may call to mind Yorgos Lanthimos’ Oscar-nominated “Dogtooth,” but it refers instead to “The Castle of Purity,” the breakthrough film by unsung Mexican master Arturo Ripstein. Inspired by a shocking case that came to light in 1950s Mexico City, the unflinching drama chronicles how Gabriel (Claudio Brook), a disturbed patriarch, walks the streets finding buyers for the rat poison that his wife and kids produce in their large home. He rules with the firm hand of an authoritarian at home, and though he forbids his family from eating meat or indulging in worldly vices, he doesn’t preach by example. Ripstein, who immediately recognized the inspiration that “Dogtooth” took from his film, is an artist recurrently interested in religious hypocrisy and the most sordid alcoves of the human mind; here, he depicts the abuse Gabriel inflicts on his household with sobering rigor, resolving in an unforgettable study of how evil has always found domesticity to be among its most convincing disguises. —CA A 15-year-old moppet named Mike (John Moulder-Brown) drops out of school and lands a gig at an East London public bath at the tail end of the swingin’ ’60s, where he’s preyed upon by the sexually underserved female clientele at the same time as he begins obsessing over his seasoned and inscrutable co-worker Susan (Jane Asher, fresh off a relationship with Paul McCartney). It’s Mike’s first job, and he doesn’t know that they’re not all like this. Plunged into a seedy but spectacular world that’s brimming with desire and steeped in confusion, Mike is soon at the mercy of his own lust for life — a lust that fixates upon Susan, and rages at all the reasons why she can’t belong to him. One of the only color movies that David Lynch ever loved, Jerzy Skolomowski’s darkly fun “Deep End” is as hyper-vivid in its production design as it is in its hormonal distress. Here is a film that sees coming of age as a delirium thick enough to drown in, as its naive protagonist — a virginal need monster who sees older men take what they want from the young women around them, and is too horny to recognize that they’re stealing — tries his best to stay afloat in the turbulent waters between free love and possessive ownership. Skolomowski’s almost psychedelic approach to psychosexual mania creates an unbroken dreamstate where nothing feels real but everything is. Where the world begs to be touched even as it remains just out of reach. Where Susan is both an inanimate crush object and a richly humanized character who’s already had to pay too high a price for her sexual currency (a dynamic that’s indelibly realized in the sequence where Mike steals a life-sized nude cut-out of a woman who looks just like Susan, and proceeds to project all of his desire onto it over the course of a long dark night). All the more true to life for its expressionistic flourishes, and for an ending that feels like it was ripped from the pages of a fable, “Deep End” announced the full possibilities of ’70s cinema with a fatal bang. —DE Widely acknowledged as the first home-grown Jamaican film to be shot with an entirely Jamaican cast and crew, Perry Henzell’s “The Harder They Come” is a shaggy-dog thriller that also happens to be a form-breaking smash (as radical as “Breathless” in its own right), and “the film that brought reggae to the world.” That’s the thing: Maybe you’ve never watched “The Harder They Come,” but you’ve absolutely heard multiple songs from its smash-hit soundtrack album. Many of them are by the film’s star Jimmy Cliff, but the tunes also include all-time bangers like “Draw Your Brakes” by Scotty and “Sweet and Dandy” and “Pressure Drop” by Toots & the Maytals. Take a look at the movie, though: Cliff stars as a wayward youth, Ivanhoe “Ivan” Martin, who grew up in the countryside but tries to make it big in the Kingston recording industry. Crossing paths with gangsters and a shady record mogul who only wants to pay him a one-and-done $20 for recording the title track, Ivan becomes a trigger-happy outlaw unwilling to play by society’s rules. It starts naturalistically enough, so much so that if you just flipped to it on TV you might think it’s a documentary at first. By the end, however, Henzell’s film actually plays more like late ‘60s Godard than “Breathless,” with scenes of militarized police pursuing Ivan on gorgeous beaches while meta touches — including the interspersed use of Sergio Corbucci’s “Django” — break down why we’re all so besotted by outlaw mystique in the first place. Even if the music gets more of the attention, the film itself is every bit as intoxicating. If there’s the cinematic equivalent of an ear-worm, this is it. —CB Long before indie cinema as we know it found its footing in the ’90s, Claudia Weill’s “Girlfriends” delivered a groundbreaking look at female friendship, ambition, and loneliness — all through the lens of one woman’s coming-of-age in New York City. Shot on a shoestring budget (and one that almost didn’t cut it), but with razor-sharp emotional clarity, “Girlfriends” is a landmark of American independent filmmaking and one of the most criminally overlooked gems of the 1970s. Well, overlooked no more. At a time when studio films rarely centered the interior lives of women, “Girlfriends” dared to tell a story about the complexities of female independence. Melanie Mayron stars as Susan, a struggling photographer navigating career uncertainty and emotional isolation after her best friend (played by Anita Skinner) abruptly gets married and moves out. What follows is a radical exploration of solitude, creative frustration, and the shifting dynamics of female friendship. Think of it this way, can you name another film that both Stanley Kubrick and Greta Gerwig have praised? Weill’s direction captures small moments with a documentary-like intimacy that feels years ahead of its time. There’s no melodrama here — just the authentic messiness of life in your twenties, portrayed with empathy and humor. It’s a film that doesn’t just pass the Bechdel Test — it practically wrote it. In an era dominated by antiheroes and epics, “Girlfriends” carved out something smaller, more personal — and in doing so, became one of the most enduring and influential films of the decade. —KE Hayao Miyazaki is most famous for making personal, original, idiosyncratic films about his favored themes: nature, environmentalism, pacifism, feminism, youth, and aging. But for his feature debut, when Ghibli was just a glimmer in his eye, he made pure franchise popcorn entertainment. And the result is a complete blast. “The Castle of Cagliostro” is a stand-alone entry in the “Lupin III” series, an iconic manga and anime franchise about the descendant of legendary gentleman thief Arsene Lupin, as he travels the world with his criminal gang taking on heists and outfoxing the determined Interpol agent Zenigata. In “Castle of Cagliostro,” his heist isn’t to steal money or gold, but a person: Princess Clarisse, who is being forced to marry the titular Cagliostro, a monstrous greedy count. It’s a perfect setup for some fun, and “Castle of Cagliostro” is fun above all else, a total action-adventure blast with setpieces like the car chase and the often-imitated clock-tower fight that rank among the most thrilling moments in the anime film canon. Miyazaki’s confidence and skill as director from the jump is a sight to behold. —WC “The Devils” is a blasphemous film, although the hysterical profanity and nuns lasciviously tonguing Christ’s side wound aren’t what’s truly heretical about it. Instead, director Ken Russell’s most vicious critiques of the Catholic Church appear in the small moments of spiritual repose playboy priest Father Grandier (Oliver Reed) finds with a woman he meets through the church. The Holy See’s perverse lust for power means that it would rather torture and kill innocent people than allow them to find God through each other. That’s what Russell’s condemning here. The rest is all set dressing — set dressing provocative enough that Warner Bros. has done its best to suppress the film for the past 50 years, but still. —KR What is left to say about a film like “Klute?” Alan J. Pakula’s call girl noir has had, at one point or another, every element of its craft rightly celebrated by critics in the 54 years since its initial release. The textures of the film — the score, the outfits, the light fixtures and how Gordon Willis painted with them — prove the aesthetic zenith of a bygone era in American cinema. In a genre where individuals are often merely synecdoche for institutional machinations, the romance between Jane Fonda and Donald Sutherland is disarmingly grounded. Fonda’s Bree Daniel is an idol of feminist cinema, and the film’s radically non-judgmental view of sex work remains admirable. In a world so obsessed with the contradiction of cinematic voyeurism and the symbolic martyrdom of rough women, Pakula pursues different questions with better answers. “Klute” examines the sensuality of autonomy, the messiness of adult intimacy, and whether acting in direct defiance of harms suffered can ever offer real solace, or instead further trap someone within their trauma. All of this is well-worn territory, but none of that matters when you sit down to watch the movie — even now, more than 50 years since “Klute” was first released, its allure proves totally singular. —SB Meiko Kaji was already bored with playing stoic badasses by the time she was approached for the title role in Toshiya Fujita’s adaptation of Kazuo Koike’s manga series. But she liked the director and the script, so she took the job. And thank goodness she did, because Kaji’s Yuki, an assassin trained from birth to avenge her family’s deaths, is one of the most iconic action heroines in all of cinema. Her graceful movements and intense stare are practically supernatural, an effect that’s enhanced by the striking production design and stylized carnage. You might think you’ve seen the color red, but you really haven’t — not until you’ve seen “Lady Snowblood.” —KR “Why would you choose someone who loves you too little over someone who loves you too much?” Charles (John Heard) asks his lover Laura (Mary Beth Hurt) as they’re tearfully breaking up. “Because it makes me feel less of a fraud,” she curtly responds. A toxically-romantic comedy adapted from Ann Beattie’s 1976 novel, Joan Micklin Silver’s “Chilly Scenes of Winter” chronicles a doomed affair between two aimless thirtysomethings in snowy Salt Lake City. Charles pines for Laura in between wasting away at his bullshit government job and dealing with his mentally unstable mother (Gloria Grahame), but he does so to such an narcissistic, self-destructive degree that his behavior would raise significant red flags in our current social climate. Part of the greatness of “Chilly Scenes of Winter” lies in Silver’s abject refusal to condemn Charles’s obsession with Laura; instead, she empathizes with his passion, even when he’s being pointedly unlikable or downright cruel. Heard’s holistic performance treats the romantic and spiteful streaks in Charles’s character as if they emanate from the same confused source rather than two sides of a split personality. His love is as genuine as Laura’s ambivalence, which extends in just about every direction —towards Charles and her failing marriage to her dull husband, but mostly towards herself. Silver’s sincere respect for the sheer realism of her characters—their messy personalities, the fundamentally tenebrous nature of their relationship, their asymmetrical love for each other—has no parallel in the domestic drama. Yet, it’s Silver’s choice to situate Charles and Laura’s mutual anguish within, as opposed to outside, life’s myriad headaches that elevates their relationship to unexpected cinematic heights. Overfamiliar bosses and lovesick secretaries, familial burdens and friendly obligations, the humdrum routine of going to work and feeding oneself in winter intrude upon Charles’s heartache. Neither his lovelorn desires nor Laura’s guilt can take priority over everything else in their respective worlds because there’s simply too many unsexy adult responsibilities to manage, until eventually the yearning becomes another chore. Silver acutely understands that casual tragedy of Charles and Laura broken relationship is that life didn’t stop for them. It just goes on and on until the pain becomes a distant memory. —VM In her dismissive review of “Seven Beauties,” Pauline Kael wrote that Lina Wertmüller “keeps her films moving by hurling salamis at the audience.” And maybe that’s true — after all, this withering dark comedy includes the most jarring close-up of a penis in the history of Holocaust cinema — but not in the way that Kael meant it. By 1975, the movies were already starving for new ways to visualize the greatest atrocity of the 20th century, which three decades of post-war cinema had already ossified into a dead language of digestible images. Wertmüller had to feed the people something. In that sense, her magnum opus is one hell of a meal. A larger-than-life Giancarlo Giannini stars as Pasqualino “Seven Beauties” Frafuso, Naples’ horniest and most flamboyant hoodlum, and a man whose utter lack of dignity is ultimately his only hope of enduring the depravity of a concentration camp. Combining the picaresque lightness of an old fable with the unfathomable horrors of real life — and using the subversive pleasures of grindhouse cinema to reinvigorate a nightmare the world is always on the brink of forgetting — Wertmüller’s greatest and most grotesque film had the temerity to think of survival as a virtue unto itself. In committing to that idea until the bitter end, “Seven Beauties” was able to prevent the Holocaust from becoming just another genre. Almost 50 years later, it still retains that same power. —DE A philosophical take on the vampire myth, Bill Gunn’s 1973 arthouse horror film features erudite characters, heady eroticism, and complex commentary on African-American ethnic and religious identity, all rendered in 16mm that shimmers in the summer heat. “Night of the Living Dead” actor Duane Jones stars, playing an anthropologist whose research into an obscure cult of African blood-drinkers gains a new dimension after his assistant (Gunn) stabs him with an ancient ceremonial dagger. It’s a startling work of art, one that was nearly lost after bad reviews led its distributor to recut it as an exploitation picture. Gunn’s version was eventually restored, and was remade by Spike Lee as “Da Sweet Blood of Jesus” in 2014. —KR Andrei Tarkovsky’s “Stalker” looks and moves unlike anything that came before it. To create one of the most immersive sci-fi worlds ever captured on celluloid, Tarkovsky relied on the neat trick of telling audiences absolutely nothing. We never learn when the film takes place or what country its characters hail from, only that there’s a dangerous place called the Zone where you can come face to face with your truest desires. It’s a harrowing journey to your final destination, which requires those brave enough to visit the Zone to hire tour guides known as “Stalkers.” That’s all we get before the Russian auteur launches us on an unforgettable journey through the contradictions of the human psyche. And it’s a good thing thing he keeps us in the dark so much, because anything else would be overkill.Tarkovsky fills the Zone with a combination of lush greenery and abandoned machinery, creating an undeniable image of humans fighting a losing battle with nature. Everything, from the tour guide’s warnings to the harsh landscape, suggests that mankind doesn’t belong here. That there are some truths lurking in the universe that we simply weren’t meant to know. It all builds to a climax that’s painful to wrap one’s mind around even after multiple viewings: Our truest desires are lurking so deep within us that there’s no guarantee that we know them ourselves. Tarkovsky was hardly the first to suggest that we’re imprisoned by our cravings and urges, but he crystallized their sinister and uncontrollable nature better than any filmmaker before or since. —CZ Martin Scorsese’s fourth feature showcased the director’s love for cinema — and for the actresses who built it — in its first frames. Shot by Marty’s pal Michael Ballhaus, this luminous 1974 drama kicks off with a nearly shot-for-shot homage to Victor Fleming’s “The Wizard of Oz” before opening up onto the world of Alice, played by Ellen Burstyn. Her delivery-driver husband, with whom she and her small son lived in a middle-of-nowhere New Mexico town, is killed on the job, and so they jettison to California in hopes of cobbling together a better life. Burstyn and Alfred Lutter, who plays Alice’ son Tommy, have an easy chemistry; he’s a child who’s been around only adults his whole life and can’t relate to people his own age, forced to fathom the dramas and dealings of those older than him. Alice and Tommy wind up in Arizona, where she takes up a job at a folksy diner in hopes of scrounging up enough change to get all the way to California. Their time in Phoenix surrounds a lovely, leisurely plot where Alice gets into yet another bad relationship. Fabulous minor roles are played by the likes of Diane Ladd as another waitress at the cafe, who has an angry and witty tongue, and Jodie Foster as a tomboy Tommy later meets in Tucson. This and “Mommy Dearest” were the only films screenwriter Robert Getchell was really known for. The gentle lilt and warmth of this kitchen-sink drama — really the last from Scorsese — make for a refreshing entree into the filmmaker’s meaner and more viscerally pungent later work. It’s the rare portrait of an intelligent and funny woman who stands on her own, even as she’s wobbling, in the director’s mostly male-driven filmography. For all the grief he’s gotten because of that slant, “Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore” remains one of the very best things he’s ever made. —RL No one could extract deep meaning from static landscapes like Chantal Akerman, and the “Jeanne Dielman” filmmaker’s juxtaposition of avant-garde structure and raw emotion was never more potent than in “News From Home.” In 1976, Akerman returned to New York City, where she lived for two years while finding her footing as an artist. There, she observed once-familiar settings made distant not only by time, but by the dispassionate lens of her camera. The resulting footage is overlaid with narration reading letters from Akerman’s mother, which are affectionate and chatty but with an undertone of sadness. Combined, they evoke a precise, poignant emotion, the lonely but thrilling sensation of standing on a train platform far from home. —KR It’s bold to make a thriller where the action is predicated on not moving around too much, and even bolder to remake the rare thriller that manages to pull that off (Henri-Georges Clouzot’s “The Wages of Fear”). But in the humid-as-hell “Sorcerer,” William Friedkin’s direction turns the tiniest shifts into the stuff of breathtaking suspense, as two trucks — doubled up to ensure that at least one of them makes the drop-off — packed with highly unstable payloads of nitroglycerin slowly crawl their way through the muddy South American jungle. The roads that lead to these moments are almost as compelling, as Friedkin skillfully introduces the movie’s four criminal protagonists and their reasons for taking this suicidal job. Cynical, sweaty, and set to one of the most transportive film scores ever composed, “Sorcerer” is New Hollywood filmmaking at its finest — even if it took a few decades for Hollywood to realize it. —KR As sublime a full-color epic as has ever been projected onto a movie screen, King Hu’s “A Touch of Zen” was key in introducing the aesthetics and values of Chinese wuxia storytelling to the West. A former Shaw Brothers studio man with an artistic eye and an exacting sense of detail, Hu brought a spiritual dimension to his tales of chivalrous combat that elevated them above their contemporaries. Here, the martial-arts action is secondary: The first real fight scene doesn’t take place until nearly an hour into the picture. But when those scenes do come, they’re nothing short of spectacular — balletic and graceful and edited with an eccentric rhythm that only enhances the magic of skilled performers in motion. —KR Made over an arduous 15 years in which star Meena Kumari’s alcoholism not only regularly derailed filming but ended her marriage to director Kamal Amrohi, “Pakeezah” at last emerged in 1972 as a typically baroque Bollywood melodrama that traces a forbidden romance between a courtesan and her highborn lover down to the next generation of their respective families. Through various twists of fate, the daughter that a wealthy man could not recognize eventually catches the eye of his nephew, repeating a cycle of heartbreak. What separates the film from its peers is the sheer depth of Amrohi’s direction, which often makes up for Kumari’s inconsistent dancing in musical sequences with a heavy use of other performers arrayed in dizzying multi-planar compositions that cross the elaborate blocking of Jacques Tati’s “Playtime” with the most ambitious Indian dance choreography. Rendered in luminous color, “Pakeezah” is like an ornate music box, suspended outside of rationality or even time while conveying an instantly felt emotional directness. —JC Frederick Wiseman’s arc is one of the most important in the history of American documentary film: from a deep skeptic of U.S. institutions, to a fierce defender of them. “Welfare” is one of his greatest achievements because it occupies a kind of middle ground — and points to exactly where America would be headed over the next 50 years. Set in a New York City welfare office, Wiseman’s film paints a portrait of American social assistance as existing in a kind of perpetual defensive posture. It consists almost entirely of deeply suspicious interviews between the welfare office workers and the struggling people they’re ostensibly there to help, as the workers almost never seem to trust the people who’ve come in search of the assistance they need to survive. Each applicant who’s there to talk about a check that got lost in the mail or some other changed circumstance is kept at arm’s length with a verbal 10-foot pole, and subjected to a litany of questions that assume ill intent or ignorance of the office’s practices so profound that they don’t “deserve” help. This is 1975, just 10 years after the establishment of Great Society programs, but the Nixon-Ford push toward defunding these institutions is already underway. You can’t get rid of welfare and Medicaid altogether? Just make certain they’re so underfunded and understaffed they become hollowed out husks, their employees so overworked and undertrained that the people they are meant to help come to hate the very idea of government and are teed up to vote to dismantle it even further in the decades to come. Wiseman’s fly-on-the-wall approach relies upon luck and patience, and he captures lightning in a bottle with a particularly poetic welfare applicant who ends his film with a prophetic summation — not only of his situation, but also of what it says about where America was headed. He suggests that if this country does so little to help its own people — and make no mistake, this is a portrait of welfare as a system of loss and risk mitigation (with policing as a Band-Aid for everything) rather than one actually trying to help people and, you know, encourage a healthier, more productive, less aggrieved society — America would cease to exist by 1988. It’s taken a bit longer than that, but his prediction is clearly in the process of coming true. “Welfare” isn’t only a lucid portrait of the past, it’s also Wiseman’s most prescient vision of the future. —CB Not only the greatest journalism movie ever made, “All the President’s Men” is in some ways the ‘70s movie par excellence, with its combination of an absolute naturalism in its acting and writing — courtesy of an extraordinary script by William Goldman — and a subtle expressionism in the cinematography by Gordon Willis. Goldman made an extraordinary choice: To only adapt the first half of Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward’s book, ending the film with Nixon’s second inauguration in January 1973. It takes some of the melodrama out of the story of Watergate, and puts the focus squarely on the journalistic process. One thing is certain: “All the President’s Men” features the greatest “phone acting” of all time, with extremely lengthy scenes of Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford’s Bernstein and Woodward speaking with source after source to assemble a journalistic puzzle for the ages. In Goldman’s hands, this is dialogue that’s purely procedural, full of pauses and filler words and dead ends (only a little of Bernstein and his girlfriend Nora Ephron’s script rewrite that established Bernstein as “catnip to the ladies,” according to Goldman, made it in), and brought to understated but never less than thrilling dramatic life by director Alan J. Pakula, with Redford overseeing the entire production through his Wildwood Enterprises company. As he had achieved in his previous films of his “Paranoia Trilogy” (“Klute” and “The Parallax View”), Pakula creates a pervasive mood of fear — a fear that had threatened to become the animating force in American life. If anything, it turns out that we weren’t being paranoid enough. —CB Sometimes the smallest conflicts demand the largest canvases. Cinematographer Gordon Willis photographs New York City in black-and-white Panavision widescreen for “Manhattan,” infusing the on-screen metropolis with timeless romantic grandeur. The city’s ineffable beauty lies in tension with the neuroses of Isaac Davis (director and co-writer Woody Allen), a twice-divorced middle-aged comedy writer juggling a relationship with seventeen-year-old high school student Tracy (Mariel Hemingway) and his growing attraction to cerebral journalist Mary (Diane Keaton), who’s having an affair with Isaac’s married best friend Yale (Michael Murphy). While Allen invests himself in the autogenous problems of the cultured class, he often throws them in sharp relief by situating them within the splendor of their urban environment. Manhattan streets become a playground for intellectual gamesmanship and emotional bonding. A conversation about past lovers and contemporary trysts takes place against the transcendental darkness of the Hayden Planetarium. Gramercy Park whizzes by in the background as a desperate man runs to save a doomed romance. They consume the city, but can’t lose themselves in it. Willis’s visual beauty neither elevates nor obscures the self-involved headaches of Allen’s characters. Instead, it envelops them, imbuing them with a cinematic gloss while keeping them firmly relegated to the mortal realm. The quotidian, narcissistic concerns at the heart of “Manhattan”—trying to find love and meaning at all personal costs, forgoing integrity for immediate pleasure, deferring mortality by throwing oneself into art — still comprise the primordial goo of human experience. “You have to have a little faith in people,” Tracy tells Isaac at the end of the film, after he uses her, mostly to torture himself, and then blithely tosses her aside for a shot at Mary, only to regret it the second he’s alone again. The famous line — delivered impeccably by Hemingway, who gives a remarkably unaffected performance that still feels miraculous — prompts a silent, powerfully uncertain reaction from Allen that can be read a million different ways. The cathartic Gershwin score underscores the irony of the moment’s superficially straightforward catharsis: Allen’s film argues people are predictable and disappointing, and that the only faith to be found in them is the consistency of their corruption. What’s left is art, which, of course, is made by people. If life is only worth living because of art, and art exists because of (or maybe in spite of) people, and people are inherently corrupt, then is life worth living? The “unsolvable, terrifying problems of the universe” endure unabated. —VM At his core, Bobby Dupea is a searcher. Restless and irresolute, he’s determined to find purpose in a world that baffles him and amongst people who bore him. Born into an upper-class family of musical prodigies, Bobby rejects the comforts of his upbringing and his considerable artistic talents in favor of a hardscrabble blue-collar life. But it’s clear he doesn’t work on an oil rig or date a waitress with country western aspirations for the progressive optics, or even to alienate his family. His drive for adventure, to negate all semblance of former identity, comes from a sincere, obscure place buried deep in his heart. By 1970, this archetype — the privileged societal drop-out who leaves home to, per Simon and Garfunkel, “look for America” — had amassed some clichés in a post-Summer of Love culture. In the hands of most actors, Bobby Dupea would resemble a collection of affectations instead of a whole human being. But Jack Nicholson is not “most actors,” and thus he imbues the protagonist of Bon Rafelson’s “Five Easy Pieces” with the disordered interiority of a character from literature. He conveys his confused anger and deep-seated sorrow with casual grace, whether he’s trying to contain his uncouth, terminally sweet girlfriend Rayette (a remarkable Karen Black), or manage his barely-concealed contempt around his blue-blooded family, whom he reluctantly agrees to visit in the Pacific Northwest after hearing about his patriarch’s poor health. It’s only the presence of the earnest, grounded Catherine (Susan Anspach), a piano student studying at his family home who’s attracted to Bobby but can’t stomach his apathy, that challenges his hard exterior. The film is defined by an existential melancholy, accented by László Kovács’s painterly photography and conveyed through Nicholson’s performance. In its most famous scene, Bobby patiently confronts a stubborn diner waitress whose strict adherence to the establishment’s “no substitutions” policy has made it impossible for him to order a side of toast. (“You want to hold the chicken salad?” the waitress sneers. “I want you to hold it between your knees,” Bobby famously responds.) Though funny and righteous, the scene’s anti-establishment fervor is tinged with despair. However clever he may be, Bobby just can’t adapt to the customs of a diner, let alone his family or America. He doesn’t get his toast, he doesn’t land the girl he wants or already has, and he doesn’t find purpose. But as the ending indicates, nothing will stop him from trying. —VM Almost certainly the greatest student film ever made, “Eraserhead” was made by a young David Lynch with a budget of $100,000, a series of soundstages and sets owned by the American Film Institute, and a wife and child he was caring for at home. From those humble beginnings, Lynch created something immortal — a stark and enigmatic hallucination that feels untethered to any specific time or place, but continues to endure as a result of its hyper-potent elusiveness. Inspired by his experiences of fatherhood, and his time living with his young family in the Fairmont neighborhood of Philadelphia, Lynch transports “Eraserhead” viewers to an industrial landscape that feels devoid of light and hope, where the hapless hero (Jack Nance, with an iconic shock of frazzled hair) struggles to care for the strange monster his girlfriend gave birth to. With evocative black-and-white photography Frederick Elmes and Herbert Cardwell, along with unnerving sound design from Lynch himself that disorients at every turn, “Eraserhead” is a work of remarkable craft far beyond its modest origins — and a heartbreaking portrait of parental anxiety that will find purchase with a new generation of viewers for as long as movies can still find their cults. —WC Barbara Kopple’s landmark documentary opens with shots of Kentucky coal miners lying flat on a conveyer belt as they slide down the depths of the Brookside Mine, literalizing the pernicious capitalistic notion of human beings as tools. She spends the remainder of the film illustrating the dignity and resolve of those same miners as they strike against the Eastover Coal Company for refusing to honor their union contract with the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA). Kopple’s righteous on-the-ground filmmaking goes within people’s homes and behind picket lines to capture the miners’ effectively confrontational tactics and the unsustainable conditions that made the strike inevitable, including Eastover’s indifference to basic safety standards, which lead to prevalent cases of black lung amongst the laborers, and the Duke Power Company’s record profit increases while worker wages stagnate compared to the cost of living. As “Harlan County, USA” makes clear, Brookside miners were never going to quietly die in squalor without a fight. Kopple leverages the best of vérité techniques to immerse audiences into Harlan County’s social and economic milieu while refusing to strictly adhere to direct cinema orthodoxy. She seamlessly incorporates archival footage, fly-on-the-wall observational footage of union meetings, direct interviews with miners and their wives, and spare use of expositional intertitles to situate viewers in the present-tense moment. Though her primary motivation was to document the struggle, Kopple rarely sacrifices aesthetics in pursuit of that goal. Close-ups of hardened miner faces often speak louder than their words. Transitional montages of poverty-line life soundtracked by folk music illuminate the necessity of labor conflicts in America. A magnificent single take depicts the strikers, who have blocked off a public road leading to the mines, demand the local sheriff deliver an arrest warrant to head gun thug Basil Collins, who sits in a line of cars waiting to threaten the picketers. “Harlan County, USA” typifies the emotional power of worker solidarity exhibited in union meetings and funerals, in demonstrations outside the Duke Power’s North Carolina and on Wall Street. Yet, Kopple is careful not to tip into convenient utopian thinking. As much as the film was created in part to generate a manual for labor organizers, she depicts how hard-fought gains can be just as easily nullified by a divided workforce or ineffectual union leadership. Rhyming with the opening scenes, “Harlan County, USA” closing sequence features miners leaving Brookside mine after another day of drudgery. Kopple’s point is potently unsubtle: as long as people need to work to live, and as long management believes in profits over people, the fight will continue. —VM Unsparing and uncompromising, Martha Coolidge’s debut feature documents its own creation while also re-staging the director’s adolescent rape. Coolidge’s metafictional approach provides the director and her actors — Michele Manenti, who plays Coolidge as a teenager and is herself a sexual assault victim, and Jim Carrington, who plays Coolidge’s attacker — the venue to process trauma without mitigating its horrors. The narrative scenes of a young Martha going on a date from hell and then having to face the judgment of her boarding school dorm-mates never once play like a chintzy after-school special, even as the audience remains constantly aware of their artificial nature. Meanwhile, the fourth-wall-breaking sequences, when Coolidge discusses rape culture and gendered approaches to sexuality with her actors, both of whom bravely commit to the project while also being rattled by the material, startle in their emotional honesty and notable lack of judgment. In the interim 50 years, Americans have become slightly — slightly — more conscious of the prevalence of sexual assault, the importance of consent, and the insidiousness of victim blaming. Yet, “Not a Pretty Picture” never once feels dated in its insights or approach. On the contrary, it feels sadly contemporary. By embracing the constructed unreality of her real-life memory while simultaneously witnessing actors dedicate themselves to its authenticity, Coolidge generates a quietly cathartic experience. “Not a Pretty Picture” never functions like an educational text (though Carrington admits the film could serve that purpose), and Coolidge doesn’t pretend to be in the business of imparting lessons on her actors or her audience. Still, it’s clear that everyone involved comes away affected by the project. Coolidge situates her cast and crew and the audience inside and outside her life-altering experience in order for them to viscerally feel her pain while also intellectually consider it. One of the great debut features of the decade, “Not a Pretty Picture” acutely understands that cinema offers an illusory space, one whose inherently manufactured nature allows memories to be projected and ensnared where they can be experienced without being relived. —VM At a retrospective screening last December, Elaine May clarified that while her downbeat buddy comedy “Mikey and Nicky” does have laughs, they’re “just not the cheery kind.” Inspired by May’s observations of low-level gangsters in Chicago, the film explores male friendship at its most abject, as two lifelong pals — one a maudlin drunk played by John Cassavetes, the other a practical family man embodied by Peter Falk — embark upon an ostensibly freewheeling nighttime journey towards a sobering and inevitable dawn. Misunderstood, like much of May’s work, upon its initial release, “Mikey and Nicky” has seen found its rightful purchase as a classic thanks to May’s incisive screenwriting and the believably desperate performances of her stars. —KR Among everything else you could say about George Lucas’s cinematic cosmic cocktail: Is this simply the most talked about movie of all time? If so, that makes finding something new to offer on the subject a major challenge. And yet, the richness of this work is such that there always seems to be another angle to explore. Like how a camera had never tilted and panned through a starfield before “Star Wars.” Or how the “Mos Eisley Cantina” theme is basically just Dixieland jazz with a little bit of the Charleston added in for good measure. Or the extraordinary narrative choice to just plunge viewers into the middle of the action and leave it to viewers to get their own bearings — there’s never an explanation of what a Jawa is or why they’ve suddenly kidnapped our droid heroes, they just are. You figure it out. That’s Lucas’s soft-spoken invitation to us to explore this galaxy on our own and find our own way around — and millions upon millions formed their own personal connection with “Star Wars” as a result. When you find your own way to something, it’s always a more powerful bond than when it’s imposed on you. Critics always like to point out the way that “Star Wars” stands on the shoulders of Old Hollywood adventure serials like “Flash Gordon,” but as much as Lucas excavated the past, he reinterpreted it too, through his generational post-Vietnam lens. Tunisia doesn’t just replace, say, Monument Valley for a desert landscape, Lucas also has it that the Empire massacres a group of indigenous people early in the film and clumsily tries to hide their murders by pinning it on another indigenous group. Then has the Empire destroy an entire planet, basically just because it can. For as much as it’s a standalone film, “Star Wars” is also a rewarding companion piece to “American Graffiti.” That film is all about a teenager questioning whether he really wants to leave home, about “refusing the call” in Joseph Campbell terms. “Star Wars” is all about what happens after, when you’ve actually left. How you have to find out who you are and what you’re made of, and put together a new family you find along the way. We may not have to take on a Death Star first thing, but the leap that we all have to take in growing up has rarely found a more universal expression than it does in “Star Wars.” —CB Humble Italian peasants living at the end of the 19th century serve as the collective protagonist of Ermanno Olmi’s gorgeously orchestrated, Palme d’Or-winning pastoral saga. Men, women, and children toll away day in and day out on fields that don’t belong to them — all to enrich the wealthy landowner while they struggle to survive on what little they are allowed to keep. Under these precarious circumstances, where every pair of hands is put to use doing manual labor, sending a child to school is a luxury few can afford. One couple decides to spring for it anyway, as the local priest has encourage them to nourish their boy’s God-given intelligence in the hopes that their sacrifice may pay off down the road. But that’s only one story in this boisterous farmhouse of tales. We also a widow trying to support her six children by washing other people’s clothes, and several young people who seek love in a reality where the death of a farm animal — or even something as small as a broken shoe — can test a family’s resilience. And as calamity befalls them, their only solace is the belief that somehow the grace of God will pull them from their desperation. The brilliance of Olmi’s ensemble piece lies in how organically, and unhurriedly, it weaves in and out of each family’s vicissitudes, while also offering glimpses into the unrest that’s brewing beyond the confines of this community. —CA From the poorly designed stunts that brutalized Ellen Burstyn and 14-year-old Linda Blair, to filmmaker William Friedkin’s infamous use of the so-called “practical scare” on set (he reportedly fired real guns at will to keep his actors alert), “The Exorcist” is a cinematic masterpiece — and horrifying in more ways than one. I haven’t even gotten into that mysterious studio fire, yet! The unnerving and electric possession of Regan MacNeil was adapted by screenwriter William Peter Blatty from his 1971 novel. The story, particularly its Georgetown setting, was inspired by a real case of attempted exorcism documented by the Catholic Church in 1948, but Blatty and Friedkin’s influence hung over the 1970s in the shadows of “The Exorcist” and its varied successors. Between works like Richard Donner’s monumental “The Omen” (1976), and John Boorman’s divisive, locus-infested “Exorcist II: The Heretic” (1977), not every cinematic follow-up to “The Exorcist” feels worthy of its association with the Oscar winner for Best Adapted Screenplay. (It also took home Best Sound.) But you could argue the same thing about the countless generically named “Creepy Girl” props you’ll find resembling Blair in haunted decoration stands every Halloween… and who doesn’t love those? Worth making the predictable word choice to call it “head-spinning” at least once, “The Exorcist” begins slow — stewing in the sands of an archaeological dig that unleashes a terror from the pitch-black depths of hell onto a little girl and her woefully screwed mom in D.C. If you don’t know the face of Pazuzu yet, you will have that unholy magic burned into your brain after just one viewing. Father Damien Karras (Jason Miller) tries his best, but decades later, the late actor’s son, who is now a genre filmmaker himself, is still grappling with what happened to the unlucky man on those godforsaken stairs. —AF The opening shot of blaxploitation was significantly more radical than what came after. Multi-hyphenate creator Melvin Van Peebles’ goal with this 1971 firebomb — which came in the wake of his first and only Hollywood production, “The Watermelon Man” — was nothing less than a complete annihilation of conventional cinematic form, as he defied every rule of Hollywood production and editing to create “the first Black Power film” (even going so far as to arm his crew). Bolstered by the support of the Black Panther Party and the tagline, “Rated X by an All-White Jury,” Van Peebles’ missive became a massive box office hit despite — or perhaps because of — its unblinking approach to sex and brutality. Fifty years on, “Sweet Sweetback’s Badasssss Song” is still incendiary, challenging, and one of a kind. —KR An unsparingly nativist satire of colonial arrogance, Nelson Pereira dos Santos’ cinema novo masterpiece remains one of film history’s most cutting rebukes against the white savior narrative that it has done so much to propagate over the last 125 years. Set in 16th century Brazil, the deliciously titled “How Tasty Was My Little Frenchman” stars Arduíno Colassanti as an unnamed settler who’s captured by the indigenous Tupinambás — who believe him to be Portuguese — and told that he will be ritualistically eaten in eight months. It’s not a promising situation for our protagonist, but after being assigned a young wife (Ana Maria Magalhães as Seboipepe) and given free run of her village, our blond “hero” begins to grow comfortable in his new surroundings. He even starts to adopt the local customs and dress (or lack thereof), confident that his captors will come to recognize the savagery of their own customs in the face of his evolved Christian grace. He even appears to fall in love with Seboipepe, and assumes the feeling is mutual. Spoiler alert: There’s a reason why this movie isn’t called “I Didn’t Eat My Husband.” It turns out that Seboipepe is mostly concerned with claiming the best piece of white meat. From its title on down, “How Tasty Was My Little Frenchman” is inflexibly — gleefully — rooted in the perspective of the Tupinambás, whose understanding of the world has been untainted by the hegemony of the European invaders. That ahistorical point-of-view will ultimately lead to their extermination, but not before Pereira dos Santos is able to reverse the time-honored prejudices of Western filmmaking and create a story that identifies with the conquered at all costs. In doing so, he offers a bitingly sardonic reminder that history is easier to swallow than it is to digest. —DE A product of the Direct Cinema movement of observational documentary filmmaking that gave birth to masterpieces like “Grey Gardens” and “Don’t Look Back,” “Gimme Shelter” was born when directors Albert and David Maysles and Charlotte Zwerin were allowed to tag along on the final three weeks of the Rolling Stones’ legendary 1969 tour. What could have been a straightforward rock doc — featuring some impressive behind-the-scenes footage and performances from the legendary band — instead became a chronicle of something far greater when the filmmakers captured the infamous Altamont Free Concert that capped the group’s American leg, complete with footage of the killing of concertgoer Meredith Hunter. Shot with a hazy lens that appropriately feels like an acid trip, “Gimme Shelter” documents all the managerial and organizational failure that allowed the concert to descend into chaos, and the discordant, nightmarish events of the night itself. One of the rawest and most unvarnished non-fiction films of its time period, “Gimme Shelter” is more than a concert doc, its a portrait of a changing era, as the dreams of the ‘60s made way for the cynicism of the ‘70s. —WC Few actors embody everything great about ‘70s cinema better than Gene Hackman. A late bloomer who seemingly stumbled backwards into an acting career, his unvarnished everyman characters were highlights of many of the decade’s best films. And his talents were never put to better use than as Harry R. Caul (a homophonically droll name for a wiretapper), a surveillance expert who falls down a rabbit hole of paranoia after hearing what he believes to be dangerous information that could affect a couple he was hired to spy on. The performance takes a quintessential Hollywood archetype — the washed up man who has long sworn off morality after being haunted by past mistakes — and updates it for a world in which nobody felt like they could trust a word that anyone else was saying. Francis Ford Coppola, in the midst of his all-time great filmmaking run, is at the height of his technical powers, using intricately composed shots of San Francisco and brilliant sound design to illustrate Caul’s mastery of surveillance and his earned distrust in the people who employ him. But the stylization is all grounded in the sad portrait of the character’s life that Coppola and Hackman paint for us. I have personally never attended a surveillance equipment convention, but it’s not hard to imagine how quickly your trust would erode if you spent all of your days hanging out with private sector spies eager to brag about the latest answering machine they broke into. Amid a sea of self-described paranoid thrillers from a very paranoid decade, “The Conversation” stands out among the finest because it managed to meet a national moment without ever having to diverge from its protagonist’s natural truths. —CZ In the films of Jacques Rivette, Paris is less a city than a giant stage or playground upon which characters project imagined dramas, but none of his work takes that idea to a more fantastical extreme than “Duelle.” Here, Juliet Berto and Bulle Ogier’s cryptic femmes fatales are not merely young bohemians roaming around town making up conspiracies and mysteries to add spice to their lives but goddesses in mortal form engaged in a contest of wills that predates human life. As the women gradually orient themselves toward their latest cosmic confrontation, they occupy the rest of their time tempting mortals into their thrall with behaviors heavily indebted to classic noir. In the process, Rivette crafts an impressionistic tribute to everything from Marlene Dietrich’s collaborations with von Sternberg, Weimar-era expressionistic thrillers, even the lucid-dreaming poetic mythology of Jean Cocteau. Eschewing mere homage for a sublimation of past forms into something new, “Duelle” reconfigures the cinephilia of the Cahiers critic-filmmakers into a vision of cinema as timeless as the oldest myths of the ancient world. —JC Clint Eastwood was already the star and director of numerous westerns by the time he made “The Outlaw Josey Wales,” but it was here he fully emerged from the shadows of early collaborators Sergio Leone and Don Siegel to establish himself as the true heir to John Ford’s vision of the West. Physically and psychologically scarred by the Civil War, Eastwood’s Josey is a vision of rage so uncontrollable that the massacre of surrendering comrades by Union troops seems more a convenient excuse for inevitable bloodshed than justifiable cause. As in “The Searchers,” the film gradually pulls its protagonist back from the edge of damnation, but where Ford’s movie offers moral clarity at the last possible second, Eastwood’s confronts its hero’s anger throughout the story. As Josey assembles a makeshift caravan of Native Americans, harassed homesteaders, and other unfortunate souls, Eastwood draws constant but understated attention to the contrast between the Confederate’s aggrievement and the larger framework of racial, gender, and class violence in America. Slowly but surely, this wrathful Lost Cause thriller morphs into an unsentimental but nonetheless hopeful vision of community solidarity as the only true defense against the predations of individuals and systems. —JC Winner of the Palme d’Or at Cannes in 1975, and still the only African film to have ever been awarded that prize, “Chronicles of the Years of Fire” is both a political epic and a personal account of Algeria’s struggle for independence. Director Mohammed Lakhdar-Hamina stages the story with large-scale set pieces, poetic monologues, and sweeping cinematography. Crucially, however, he avoids triumphalism at every turn. Instead, his film traces how colonial violence reshaped everyday life and made revolt inevitable. It’s long, demanding, and often theatrical, but always urgent. Few African films have matched its scale, and even fewer have carried this kind of historical weight on the world stage. —TO Shudder’s “Dario Argento Panico” is an essential documentary primer for any cinephile just getting into the complex, supersaturated legacy of Italy’s most notorious genre filmmaker. Understanding the dark psychology of a man who conjured up unfathomable suspense and horror — then repeatedly cast his real wife and kids as exquisite centerpieces in those artful nightmares — is, how do you say, “tutta una cosa.” That’s Italian for “a whole thing,” and basically the entire point for dedicated fans of the director. Effectively standing in for a decade of brilliant giallo on this list, “Suspiria” is more than up to the task. The eerie magic Argento first conjured up in 1977 is best remembered for its illustrious use of color, even with “Deep Red” right there in the director’s filmography. The crimson splatters and jewel-colored glass that adorn the German ballet school where “Suspiria” takes place make it a crowning achievement in the pantheon of visual horror. That masterful dreamscape is reflected in the eyes of a young American dancer, Suzy Bannion (Jessica Harper), whose serpentine descent into supernatural madness plays out like a lethal recital on psychedelics. Loosely translated, “Suspiria” means “breathing” or “to take a deep breath.” That quietly sensual undercurrent might explain why “Challengers” director Luca Guadagnino and “50 Shades” muse Dakota Johnson teamed up to revive Argento’s classic as a high-concept art film with a well-disguised Tilda Swinton in the critically-acclaimed remake from 2018. The original can’t evoke quite the same visceral response as that film’s updated effects, but anyone whose seen the atrium-hanging sequence should be able to convince you to watch both versions. Trite but true, there’s more than one way for a witch to step on your neck. —AF One of the final films by the great Luis Buñuel, “The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoise” moves from dinner party to dinner party in a disorienting haze, each moment bleeding into the next. True to its title, the cast of characters we follow are a group of six well-off French men and women, each containing a sense of smug satisfaction and an underlying restlessness in their comfortable, mannered lives. Their attempts to dine together are thwarted by a series of vignettes both “real” and dreamed, from terrorist attacks to ghostly encounters to the discovery that their lives are actually a stage play. Buñuel’s comedy is dry as a bone, with each absurdity readily accepted by the passive ensemble. The film pokes and prods them mercilessly, with each mishap peeling away at the fundamental spiritual rot within them. It’s that unflinching meanness towards its own characters that makes “The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoise” one of the great satires in all of film history. —WC So much of Ingmar Bergman’s work was defined by the women who brought his intimate, existential dramas to life, and with whom he frequently had tempestuous romances off-screen. Kicking off an impressive late-period run from the Swedish auteur before his retirement in 1982, “Cries and Whispers,” gives one of his first muses — Harriet Andersson — a harrowing showcase that doubles as a reflection on how much time has passed since she was the ingenue launched to stardom by Bergman’s “Summer With Monika.” In this austere psychological tragedy, Andersson plays a noblewoman tucked away in a country manor dying slowly from disease, with two sisters (Liv Ullmann and Ingrid Thulin) who are distant to both her and each other. As flashbacks reveal the cruelties that curdled this family, Bergman and cinematographer Sven Nykvist bathe the film in a stark red glow, bringing fire to an icy, despairing work. And Andersson is devastating as the frail woman at the center, giving her last leading performance for the director whom her career was forever intertwined. —WC Glowing and electric, George A. Romero’s masterful “Night of the Living Dead” (1968) is iconic for a reason. But the sequel that followed his feature debut a decade later, “Dawn of the Dead” (1978), lies at the heart of a truly beloved filmography. Despite studio interference and a lack of financial stability throughout his otherwise successful artistic life, Romero is remembered as the sensitive American filmmaker whose steadfast commitment to the underdog gave the cinematic undead their reputation for social consciousness. At their most memorable, scary movies have long reflected how we can do better as people — alone or en masse. Created after several years of its director exploring other less terrifying realms, Romero’s genre homecoming endures as a remarkable collaboration between him, co-producer Dario Argento, the musical group known as the Band Goblin (credited in the film as The Goblins), and special effects wizard Tom Savini. The strongest and most ghoulish worship comes from community, and the action, comedy, and horror film worlds socialize as much as the artists here. Set inside a shopping mall, “Dawn of the Dead” sees combat collide with corpses as the zombie apocalypse from the first movie blooms into a bigger production for Romero. This nightmare is more philosophically complex, too. (Not like “Day of the Dead” levels of enlightenment, but you know, within reason.) Romero’s script masterfully disassembles the concept of a literal safe house under capitalism to explore the complacency it breeds, and to suggest that even the bravest leaders among us won’t know to burn it all down until it’s too late. —AF Med Hondo’s 1979 epic is so compelling that merely describing it is sufficient justification for its inclusion on this list. Filmed aboard a reconstructed slave ship inside an abandoned French factory, with a budget totalling $1.35 million (making it the most expensive African film ever at the time), “West Indies” is a musical satire/non-linear historiography of French colonialism. It is a whirlwind of post-Fanon interpolations with an unsparing, furious clarity of purpose. Hondo paints the history of the Caribbean under French rule as one where revolution is co-opted by capitalism, where artistic expression is disallowed without sufficient cultural assimilation, and where violence and displacement persist under the guise of progress. All of this might have amounted to little more than a politically astute curio were it not for Hondo’s total command of Western spectacle. “West Indies” has some of the greatest musical numbers ever filmed, with a dizzying sense of scale, intricacy, and imagination. Hondo plainly outdoes many of the pop artists he satirizes. The result is a blisteringly intelligent referendum on the rotten core of Euro-American cinema, and an equally potent tribute to the resilient fullness of African cultures. —SB The money alone is notable: Made for less than $9 million, “Jaws” went on to make over $470 million in global returns, including a $260 million domestic take that earned it the top spot at the box office in 1975. The film toppled other high-powered hits like “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest” and “Dog Day Afternoon,” all huge moneymakers that were decidedly non-blockbuster in nature. And “Jaws” was the first feature film to break $235 million in domestic returns. Steven Spielberg’s big hit — his first, and obviously not his last — paved the way for the massive tentpole features that now dominate the summer season, huge earners that capture both the zeitgeist and hefty audiences. The secret? It’s one that filmmakers of any generation can stand to learn, remember, and take to heart: the film is good. So many blockbusters not only eschew overall quality in service to whiz-bang entertainment and speedy fun, but they do it with truly disposal amusements. Nothing about “Jaws” is throwaway. Meticulously built from stem to stern, “Jaws” takes pains to steep us in the world of small-town Amity (it means friendship!) long before a seriously large and biblically pissed off shark makes mincemeat of many of its citizens and everyone’s nerves. Neatly divided into two distinct sections – a landlubbing first half that tracks a small town on the edge, none of it helped by a mayor who doesn’t really see a need to mess with holiday fun, no matter how many people die, followed by an alternately claustrophobic and just kinda fun death sail on the high seas — “Jaws” builds both its tension and character evolution with steady hands. While we may briefly wonder who is going to beat this thing – Ocean-adverse chief of police Martin Brody (Roy Scheider)? Grizzled fisherman and battered war hero Quint (Robert Shaw)? Know-it-all wino marine biologist Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss)? – the real question is, who is going to survive and what the hell does that even look like? Luckily for us, “Jaws” itself endures. —KE Jacques Rivette’s prankish, exuberant, and restlessly energetic “Céline and Julie Go Boating” boasts one of the all-time great cinematic friendships. It’s also a total explosion of the rules of cinematic storytelling, and one of the most innovative features of the 1970s — no small feat. Dominique Labourier plays Julie, a reverie-prone librarian who meets Céline (Juliet Berto) in a sequence straight out of Lewis Carroll, as Céline keeps dropping objects that Julie can’t chase her down fast enough to return. That sets the stage for an enchanting, but never precious or twee, tale of doubles… in addition to a love triangle, a mysterious house, and a subplot about a psychedelic candy that allows the two women — who become fast friends and roommates after that chance meeting — to seemingly bend the rules of time altogether. Here’s where Rivette tosses yet another genre, the murder mystery melodrama, into “Céline and Julie” in ways that gleefully reinvent the very references he’s trying to make and then subvert. “Céline and Julie Go Boating” feels in many ways like the original hangout movie of the 1970s, bouncing along episodically, more jaunty picaresque than manic pixie dream girl omnibus. Despite running nearly three-and-a-half hours, this allusion-heavy (and illusion-heavy) movie is made totally accessible by Rivette’s disorienting and tradition-disrupting style. More than that, it feels like a fresh discovery each time you rewatch it. —RL “Everything begins and ends at the exactly right time and place,” says an Australian schoolgirl with dead eyes and a breathy, bated voice at a pivotal moment in Peter Weir’s lastingly elusive “Picnic at Hanging Rock.” Ushering in a New Wave of Australian 1970s cinema that put the country’s film scene on the global map, Weir’s masterpiece remains equally influential for contemporary filmmakers such as Sofia Coppola, who picked up Weir’s mantle as the cinema’s reigning master of dazed blonde women strung out on fainting couches. Like patterns in the clouds, you can read almost anything into the bottomless pit of mystery that becomes the center of this unforgettably strange portrait of sexual repression, written by screenwriter Cliff Green. It’s Valentine’s Day, 1900, at the fictional all-girls boarding school called Appleyard College, where a group of students head out toward a geological formation, Hanging Rock, in Victoria. Three vanish without a trace, seemingly into a crevice in the formation. The sighting of a strange red cloud that coincided with the three young women’s seeming evaporation into nowhere, as told by Edith (Christine Schuler), could be read as a limpid, subtle-as-a-chainsaw metaphor for looming femininity and the disappearances themselves as the loss of innocence into adulthood. More memorable than its symbolism, however, is the seductive, ethereal, and dread-spiked atmosphere “Picnic at Hanging Rock” conjures, leaving you in as dazed a spell as the protagonists whose dilemma remains stubbornly unsolved. That’s where Weir’s chillingly directed film gets its extraordinary power. —RL Banned after the 1979 Iranian Revolution and thought lost for decades, Mohammad Reza Aslani’s miraculous “Chess of the Wind” wasn’t widely seen until its 2020 restoration, when it arrived with the feeling of a priceless discovery. Set almost entirely inside a decaying aristocratic mansion in early 20th century Tehran, the film is a tightly controlled chamber drama about inheritance and control. A paralyzed woman battles her stepfamily for power, while servants lurk and loyalties shift in silence. The stillness is deceptive; every movement, glance, and sound is loaded with meaning. Its surface recalls the visual grammar of 1970s festival auteurs, but Aslani builds a world anchored in the historical textures of Iranian society, shaped by class conflict, gendered power, and a quiet subversion of patriarchy. Its formal control and long absence make it one of the most arresting rediscoveries in recent world cinema history. —TO The fate of the midnight movie is still pretty much at the mercy of kids who can’t decide if they should cancel each other for liking “The Rocky Horror Picture Show.” But Brian de Palma’s “Phantom of the Paradise” reigns supreme as the definitive best piece of flashy genre cinema from the 1970s — a glorious ode to a rocker punished for his passion that was itself tortured on its rocky road to theaters. Thanks to a nonsensical legal challenge from Led Zeppelin, moviegoers have to be pretty lucky to catch De Palma’s extraordinary 1974 glam opera as it was meant to be seen. Censorship plagues all publicly available versions of the film, and a particularly egregious restoration from a physical media release a few years ago left many fans disturbed by the intricate production details lost to its poorly updated color. Still, whichever version you watch, the tragic tale of musical genius Winslow Leach (William Finley) shines through as a timeless testament to the power of talented freaks with a song to sing. Paul Williams scored “Phantom of the Paradise,” which also casts the Grammy-winning composer as the villainous namesake executive for Swan Records. Swan destroys what could be a quick rise to fame for Winslow and his band, The Juicy Fruits, when he steals the basis for their first hit song. Enter Beef (Gerrit Graham), a competitive diva whose effort to help Swan screw over Winslow ends explosively. The glittery terror that surrounds that reveal commingles bejeweled platforms and fishnets (with some of the more disturbing elements of the Gypsy Rose Blanchard story?) in a singular “Phantom of the Opera” homage. It also sees “Suspiria” final girl Jessica Harper centerstage as its fresh-faced Angel of Music in a performance that could almost make you forget the movies’ later attempts at creating their own Christine. —AF Dripping with style and sick with unease in its portrait of an emotionally detached man (Jean Louis-Trintignant) hired to assassinate his ex-fascist former professor, Bernardo Bertolucci’s “The Conformist” illuminates its protagonist’s psyche with a scintillating dance of light and shadow — an approach that would have an enormous influence on Francis Ford Coppola as he ramped up to make “The Godfather.” Shooting in Rome and Paris as well as Cinecittà Studios in Italy, production designer Ferdinando Scarfiotti and cinematographer Vittorio Storaro (unjustly robbed of an Oscar nomination for his hugely influential work here) summoned the vibes of 1930s Fascist Italy with extraordinary detail, emboldened by Bertolucci’s baroque style. At the center of this cold — but never bloodless — movie is the relationship between Marcello (Trintignant) and Anna (Dominique Sanda), the professor’s wife whom he falls in love with fatal consequences. Those consequences are realized in a disturbing and suspenseful sequence that elegantly summarizes the movie’s themes of cowardice, repression, betrayal, offering an ultimate reminder of Marcello’s own fecklessness. Antiheroes became a dominant trademark of 1970s cinema both abroad and in the United States; look toward the moral complexities of Marcello for an early figurehead of that trope, all wrapped up in a doom-laden but ecstatically glorious movie. —RL A three-part nonfiction epic, Patricio Guzman’s black-and-white masterpiece is unrivaled as the premier filmic document preserving the memory of Chile before, during, and after one of its most troubled chapters, which has defined its modern history. Starting in the months before military dictator Augusto Pinochet came to power by force, Guzman set his camera against a country in crisis. The first installment, 1975’s “The Insurrection of the Bourgeoisie,” hinges on the director’s interviews with working class people as they take to the streets to demonstrate in defense of Salvador Allende’s government, and to denounce how the elite has fought to maintain their privileged position at the expense of the masses. On the ground amid the turmoil, “The Coup d’état” goes on to bear witness to violent clashes, hopeful protests, ardent speeches, and ultimately to the U.S.-backed overthrow of Allende on September 11, 1973, which ushered in a dark period for the South American nation. The final part, “Popular Power,” winds back the clock to serve as something of a prequel, as Guzman explores the proletariat’s frustrated attempts at reclaiming their power. Although forced into exile for decades, the acclaimed filmmaker has since continued to observe Chile’s transformation over the years, and to investigate his own complicated relationship with the country of his birth in several subsequent works (including 1997’s “Chile, Obstinate Memory,” which found Guzman screening his trilogy for Chileans who had never seen it before). But none of those later projects, strong as they are, can hope to match the potency of watching history change from within the eye of the storm. —CA It’s impossible to study “Apocalypse Now” in a vacuum, as the film’s legacy will always be defined by the history surrounding it: the famously harrowing shoot that pushed Francis Ford Coppola to his limits and inspired the excellent documentary “Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker’s Apocalypse,” the dramatic Cannes premiere where Coppola’s massive bet paid off with a Palme d’Or win, and the director’s insistence to continue revising it into the 21st century. But even without succumbing to the crass temptation to use filmmaking as a metaphor for war, time and distance have proved that the chaos underscoring “Apocalypse Now” have only strengthened its legacy. The most appropriately pessimistic film by one of America’s greatest optimists, it’s now easy to see “Apocalypse Now” as the end of the New Hollywood era. That has far more to do with correlation than causation, but it’s also symbolically fitting: After a decade of watching the industry release auteur-driven films about the gaping hole that the Vietnam War left in America society, Coppola tackled the war that lurked over the decade’s other masterpieces so directly that it’s hard to shake the feeling that filmmakers moved on because there was nothing left to say. It would be impossible to determine exactly how much of the film’s chaos was pre-planned, and how much emerged naturally from a shoot so grueling shoot that it seemed as if God was determined to punish the auteur for his ambition. But Coppola’s vision resonated for a reason, and the pairing of his prescient foresight — about how the military would evolve in a direction of specialization that allows for even greater brutality — and the lucid observation that war brings out sides of men that they’re not capable of looking in the mirror proved to be a lethal combo. “Apocalypse Now” is New Hollywood radicalism executed on a scale that few of his peers ever received a chance to try. It’s a coda to two eras of American history, one artistic and one historical, and remains the definitive portrayal of a war that defined a generation. —CZ This isn’t to say that Hollis Frampton’s “(nostalgia)” is necessarily the greatest experimental film of the 1970s (competition for that useless title abounds, even from the other chapters of the artist’s “Hapax Legomena” film cycle), but rather to argue that it might be the most productive experimental film of the 1970s to put on a commercial-oriented list such as this one. Epitomizing the “structural” cinema movement that Frampton rejected as a coherent framework, “(nostalgia”) is a singularly potent gateway drug to another universe of moviemaking — one in which the shape of a film can be the ultimate expression of its content. To watch “(nostalgia”) is to discover, reconnect with, or simply exalt in the idea that there is something inherently profound, and in this case also extremely poignant, to the materials and construction of cinema itself. Here, the materials are simple, their construction is plain, and the deep well of feeling that Frampton conjures between them is raw, lucid, and inviting. Thirty-eight minutes. Thirteen photographs. One electric burner. A formative picture from the early days of the filmmaker’s career is placed on a hot plate, where it disintegrates in the flames as a plainspoken voice — speaking in the first person, but in fact belonging to avant-garde legend Michael Snow — discusses the image in the context of Frampton’s life. The images are evocatively unremarkable, the narration diaristic yet vaguely wounded. Old friends. Half-forgotten places. A pair of toilets sitting next to each other. Before long, the viewer begins to notice a glitch in the matrix: The narration isn’t describing the picture on screen, it’s describing the next picture to come. The effect is as temporally destabilizing as being ambushed by the smell of your childhood home: We’re hearing about a photograph we haven’t seen yet, and looking at a photograph we’ve already heard described. That basic misalignment is enough to create a strange and movingly porous middle ground in the space between anticipation and memory, as the pain of reflecting upon the past is dimensionalized by the natural human impulse to cast ourselves forwards into the future. Time eventually reduces it all to ash and silence, but not before Frampton is able to glimpse a fleeting truth of some kind in the movie’s dying seconds — a nowness that no other medium can give us. “Here it is. Look at it! Do you see what I see?” “(nostalgia)” is an invitation to never stop looking. —DE Has any director ever cared more about how a movie “feels” than Robert Altman with “McCabe & Mrs. Miller”? The film evokes wintry rain and snow and the puffs of dry heat from a pot-belly stove so well you almost feel like you can see Altman’s breath fogging up the camera lens. One of the greatest of all “winter Westerns,” this parable about commerce — and the role that affection and jealousy and violence play in the holding it all together — is an inimitable, oil-lamp-lit gaze into the past that also reflects the light of an eternal present at the same time. Warren Beatty wears a bear-skin coat so thick it makes you warm just to look at it. And he in turn warms the hopes of a small Pacific Northwest logging town with his card-playing skills, rictus grin, and declaration that he’s a “businessman.” Partnering with a veteran madam in Julie Christie, they open a brothel for the town, the one hope for salvation from the grim reality of the everyday — especially since the long-awaited Presbyterian Church is never quite finished. If transcendence isn’t possible, being a sinner can be the best way to endure capitalism. It sure encourages everyone to give it a shot. Pitched between a grimed-up materialism and dreamy aspirations — epitomized to perfection by the Leonard Cohen songs Altman put on the soundtrack with lyrics like “I’m just a Joseph looking for a manger” — “McCabe & Mrs. Miller” is the greatest kind of period piece: One that isn’t an escape into the past, but a way to better understand how we arrived at the present. —CB Shot over a series of weekends in South Central Los Angeles, Charles Burnett’s “Killer of Sheep” remains one of the most quietly profound films in all of American cinema. With nonprofessional actors and a focus on everyday detail, it follows a slaughterhouse worker weighed down by routine and fatigue. There is no clear plot, just fragments of life, captured with care and restraint — every one of its images feels etched in stone but fully alive at the same time. Burnett, a key figure in the L.A. Rebellion, made a film about Black working-class life without any trace of sentiment or spectacle. Its 2007 restoration brought overdue attention, but the film has always carried the same lucid clarity and profound emotional weight. —TO Screenwriter Paul Schrader’s compulsion towards male isolation, modern disaffect, and the pursuit of transcendence that promises to alleviate them both has never been more potent than it remains in his original masterpiece. Each of the film’s unimaginably bold swings lands cleanly because the script does all of the little things right. As so many have pointed out, the appalling choice to make Jodie Foster’s Iris Steensma a literal child prostitute at just 12-years-old was the only way to create a moral travesty so utterly black-and-white that it could push a morally ambivalent man to forfeit his life for a cause. That transition from fringe observer to self-defined martyr unfolds with perfect cyclicality, affording Travis Bickle a Hero’s Journey within his own head without giving us any reason to believe that we’re leaving him any better off. “Taxi Driver” is in many ways the quintessential New Hollywood film, and so much ink has been spilled about what that means — from its unapologetic portrayal of post-Vietnam bitterness to its refusal to fully cut ties with the classic storytelling traditions of “The Searchers” — that blurbing Martin Scorsese’s most sordid masterpiece seems like a waste of bandwidth. But faced with the gravity of a true masterpiece, perhaps the most radical thing we can do is look at all the misinterpretations and cheap knock-offs it inspired and sincerely conclude that it was all still worth it to get the movie we did. It’s hard to think of a higher compliment to give a film than “You’re the reason we got two ‘Joker’ movies, and yet the world is still undeniably richer for your existence.” —CZ Paris in the daytime has never felt as desolate as it does in Jean Eustache’s 220-minute relationship drama. Presenting the collapse of May ‘68 as the intellectual equivalent of Paris’s fall to the Nazis, the film depicts the city as an eerily barren metropolis populated only by small groups of emotionally atomized citizens each absorbed in their own diversions and work. No one embodies this retreat into solipsism better than Alexandre (Jean-Pierre Léaud), a student leftist turned reactionary in the wake of the progressive movement’s collapse at the end of the ‘60s. Ranting and raving about the failures of permissive society and the loss of traditional values, Alexandre nonetheless pursues two women he wants only for sex. Eustache’s film is an unsparing, eternally relevant overview of the manner in which jilted leftists can retreat into conservatism. The director even puts the ostensible progressivism of the French New Wave under a microscope, pointedly casting Nouvelle Vague poster child Léaud and positioning his character’s unchecked cinephilia as just one form of his fetishization of the past. But the filmmaker also depicts ongoing resistance of a kind, as the gradually forming bond between Veronika and Marie offers a refusal to submit to Alexandre’s attempted reassertion of chauvinist power — and a determination to retain the breakthroughs of the prior decade. —JC The most sinister and dreamlike of ’70s paranoid thrillers (its elusive sense of evil born from the unfinished state of David Giler and Lorenzo Semple Jr.’s script, the sociopathic disaffectedness of Gordon Willis’ cinematography, and the two-note twinkle of Michael Small’s synth score), Alan J. Pakula’s “The Parallax View” is a film born from the creeping unease that settled into American life as the country’s post-war idealism began to seem like the ultimate cover-up. It’s a cover-up that Warren Beatty’s guilt-ridden journalist is determined to uncover, and — in the wake of surviving a yacht explosion and foiling a bomb threat to a commercial airplane — it almost seems as if he might be able to expose the plot to assassinate the most progressive senators who popped up after Kennedy was gunned down. If only a thick feather cut and a dream were enough to set the world to rights. No such luck for the fearless Joe Frady, who finds himself at the center of a plot in which heroes are little more than handsome patsies, and villains hardly seem to have faces at all. Staged with hypnotic impassivity from the moment it starts (the spectacular opening sequence atop the Seattle Space Needle all the more impactful for its casual disregard), “The Parallax View” puts forward a much smarter and more calculated vision of a deep state conspiracy than the one we got. All the same, its closed-loop concept of American entropy — and its unnerving insistence that the truth can kill you without fully revealing itself — continues to resonate on a much darker wavelength than any of Pakula’s other ’70s classics. —DE First released 50 years ago, after Francoist censors convinced themselves that its anti-authoritarian messaging would have little social impact if buried under such a “boring” art film, Victor Erice’s “The Spirit of the Beehive” follows a gullible six-year-old girl named Ana (Ana Torrent), who sees a screening of “Frankenstein” when a mobile cinema arrives in the small Castilian village where she lives with her family in the Spanish Civil War’s immediate aftermath. Confused and horrified by the sight of Frankenstein’s monster accidentally killing a child, and the townspeople then killing Frankenstein’s monster in return, Ana’s elder sister tells her that neither of those things actually happened — that everything you see in films is fake. Later, with the memories of James Whale’s movie still fresh in her mind, Ana discovers a wounded republican soldier hiding in a sheepfold and decides to treat him with kindness instead of fear. It makes no difference to his ultimate fate. Ana’s sister was only half right in the end: “Frankenstein” may be a work of fiction, but fiction isn’t the same thing as “fake.” Erice has only made three other features since his spellbinding debut, but all have been set in the same liminal space between film and reality that he explored in his first. As beguiling and hard to shake as any movie ever made (just ask Guillermo del Toro), “The Spirit of the Beehive” sinks so deeply under the skin for its ability to fulfill cinema — and “Frankenstein”’s — promise of eternal return; its capacity as a magic trick capable of keeping the past alive long after it’s already died within us. The movies are real, Erice has always insisted. This one allows you to see that clearly. —DE As unforgivable as it is to reduce an Andrei Tarkovsky film to a 1:1 allegory for a specific current event, it’s hard to watch “Solaris” these days without feeling like it was made for 2025. It was probably made for quite a few other years too (many of which haven’t happened yet), but watching AI-generated recreations of deceased crime victims give interviews on talk shows and statements in courtrooms is a convenient reminder that Tarkovsky’s wisdom was ahead of its time.No other science-fiction film has ever been so bold in its assertion that science as a vocation isn’t all that great. “Solaris” begins with the scientific community doubting each other’s testimony to the point where they send a psychiatrist into space to audit — and potentially shut down — a research mission. When the cosmonaut makes it to the space station, he discovers that the crew’s unsupervised observation of the strange magnetic fields surrounding the ocean planet Solaris have driven one person to suicide and caused dangerous hallucinations among everyone else. And yet, despite being armed with all of the prior knowledge that nothing he sees on the ship will be real, our hero is powerless to resist a vision of his dead wife, which is is enough to make him abandon his scientific principles for a cheap facsimile of someone he once loved. It’s a moment of intellectual weakness and a major lapse in professional judgement, but anyone who says they’d act differently is lying to themselves. Tarkovsky mines the tension between the lofty ideas that guide science and the fallen nature of the humans who try to pursue them, and this sprawling, highly symbolic film is rife with many of the ideas that fascinated him throughout his entire career: that there are secrets in the world that humans aren’t meant to understand, that we’re fools to try and analyze things that should only be experienced spiritually, and that esoteric quests for metaphysical meaning are only undertaken by broken people with nothing better to do. Looking out the window towards a society that appears increasingly convinced to invent the technologies that will burn it to the ground simply because we have the technology to do so, we’d all be well-served to remember one of the film’s most profound quotes: “We’re in the foolish human predicament of striving for a goal he fears, that he has no need for.” —CZ “Days of Heaven” is a gem that has only grown more luminous with time. Filmmaker Terrence Malick was then still an emerging voice, now he’s viewed as one of American cinema’s most singular auteurs. After making his debut with 1973’s “Badlands,” Malick returned five years later with a film that’s as visually arresting as it is narratively elusive. Shot largely during the vaunted “magic hour” and steeped in natural light, “Days of Heaven” emerged from a notoriously difficult post-production process. The footage took two years to shape into a cohesive narrative, but the final product earned critical acclaim — and four Oscar nominations, including a win for Néstor Almendros’ haunting cinematography. Nearly five decades on — and with films like “The Thin Red Line” and “The Tree of Life” only expanding his mythos — Malick’s sophomore effort is seen not only as a foundational text in his body of work, but as one of the defining films of the ’70s. Its reputation rests not just on its painterly visuals, but on the dreamlike way it tells its deceptively simple tale. Richard Gere stars as Bill, a drifter who convinces his girlfriend Abby (Brooke Adams) to pose as his sister so she can marry a dying farmer (Sam Shepard) for his land. Linda Manz, who also provides the film’s ethereal voiceover, plays Bill’s actual sister, tagging along as the trio’s fragile arrangement begins to unravel. Like “Badlands,” “Days of Heaven” is remarkably lean. Despite the drawn-out editing process, the film clocks in at just 94 minutes — a rarity in Malick’s later, more sprawling work. Within that brief running time, he crafts something hypnotic, lyrical, and emotionally resonant. The film’s centerpiece — a literal blaze of glory on a wheat farm — remains one of the most indelible images in American cinema. —RC An exploitation film released in 1974 with a title as shocking and to-the-point as “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre” was never going to struggle to earn back its $140,000 budget, but that didn’t stop Tobe Hooper from reaching for the moon and tearing an irreparable cosmic rift in horror cinema. Stripped of the artificiality that tended to soften the genre, Hooper’s unvarnished masterpiece subjected moviegoers to some of the most nauseating imagery ever captured on film without so much as a moment to take a breath. The practical effects and the barbarity of the tool-powered killings hold up to this day, but it’s because of the film’s deceptively sophisticated pathos that it’s so entrenched itself in our collective psyche. Leatherface isn’t motivated by the kind of malice or revenge that drive so many other horror villains — he’s a mentally disabled man raised by a perverse family with no means of supporting him after their jobs at the slaughterhouse disappeared. Forgotten by a society that was already beginning to rot, his family’s brutal actions were underscored by the notion that something similar could be lurking at the end of any innocuous-seeming country road.The scariest part of “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre” is its utter nihilism. Hooper’s film remains so unsettling because of how blatantly it rejects the binary of good guys and bad, binary, offering us all a hideous reminder that we’re all just animals who are capable of inflicting unimaginable evils on each other once the paper-thin norms separating us from our instincts start to crumble. —CZ It’s all bad vibes and dark times in Nicolas Roeg’s hugely upsetting, weirdly tender, not quite sexy but surprisingly carnal study of mourning, “Don’t Look Now.” Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland bare it all and so much more as a WASP and a British Protestant who stare into the abyss of the absolute worst thing that could happen to any two parents — their daughter drowning in the shallowest of ponds, right outside their own English countryside home. Where most contemporary horror movies that center on grieving couples (i.e. “Antichrist,” which blurs Roeg into Tarkovsky) tend to fling them to, say, a remote cabin in the woods as a backdrop for healing, “Don’t Look Now” instead sends its grief-dazed protagonists to the crowded canals of Venice, Italy. It’s there that Sutherland’s character, John Baxter, has agreed to restore an ancient church, hauling Laura —who seems almost suspiciously emotionally blinkered given recent events — along with him. But the city’s rabbit-warren corridors, as established in Daphne du Maurier’s source novel, become M.C. Escher-esque grief portals as Laura becomes obsessed with a pair of supposedly psychic geriatric sisters. Meanwhile, there is a small person with a red hood — the very one the Baxters’ daughter wore the day she died — running around the city. “Don’t Look Now” is most infamous for a sex scene nested within Roeg’s trademark style of cross-cutting, in which two events in parallel yet discrete timelines appear to be happening at once. John and Laura are both dressing and undressing, fucking and then not fucking, with armpit-licking and cunnilingus that shocked audiences and censorship boards and by present day standards certainly isn’t prude. But what it wasn’t, and isn’t, is gratuitous. On the contrary, it situates “Don’t Look Now” as more emotionally raw-nerved romantic drama than true horror movie. Though you can’t forget the climax, which is one of the greatest of all cinematic rug-pulls, made all the more incredible by the fact that Roeg got away with it. This is the original “elevated horror”: knockout performances, skillful craft, and a director who undersides the dual sides of manipulating and cajoling actors and who can elevate schlocky material. —RL According to Elia Kazan, Barbara Loden’s last words — which she furiously spoke on her deathbed as her body gave out from breast cancer — were, “Shit, shit, shit.” Throughout their professional collaboration and marriage, the director — who cast actress-turned-filmmaker Loden in “Splendor in the Grass” — allegedly tried to undercut her autonomy and dismissed her creative ambitions. But the ambition of a woman operating below the studio system and out from her ex-husband’s eye paved the way for Loden’s “Wanda,” a troubling, often grimly hilarious and Cassavetes-adjacent landmark in the history of independent film. Played by Loden herself, Wanda is as apathetic as any woman as we’ve seen onscreen, languishing through life amid a pile-up of disappointments: She’s left her husband, granting him full custody of their children, and doesn’t protest when it’s time to sign the divorce papers. Loden, who had two children with Kazan, modeled the character after a version of herself: wandering, adrift, between jobs and between men, wedding her autobiography to a thinly sketched bank robbery plot that’s more background noise than the thrust of this existential tone poem of a 16mm-shot movie. One of the wisest, most piercingly drawn scenes in “Wanda” finds the heroine idling through a shopping mall, matching eyes with mannequins that both reflect her own soul-drained blankness and the status divided between her dreams and achievements, these life-sized “human” models adorned in clothes she could never afford. Here is one of the great portraits of a woman trying to find a place in the world, her world; she doesn’t find it by the end of the film, but the largesse of strangers (for food, for conversation, for cigarettes, for companionship) is enough carry her through another day. —RL In a pivotal decade of Hindi cinema, one film towers above the rest: “Sholay.” Ramesh Sippy’s 1975 Western, penned by Salim-Javed, was initially panned and pegged as a flop, but a stark turn in fortune would soon put it on its path to legend. Amitabh Bachchan and Dharmendra star as Jai and Veeru, two petty criminals hired by former inspector Thakur (Sanjeev Kumar) to catch the deadly bandit Gabbar Singh (Amjad Khan) — alive. The duo’s friendship is the emotional core of a film filled with love, loss, and vengeance, with supporting performances by Hema Malini, A.K. Hangal, Jaya Bachchan, and more. Indian films love to experiment with tone and genre, but the confidence of “Sholay” set a golden standard. It starts as a buddy comedy filled with heists and hijinks, then slips into the sweet mundanity of village life with its rose-colored promises of the future. After Gabbar’s introduction, it goes full Western (but not without a ridiculous detour into Veeru’s love life). To watch “Sholay” is to be sublimely entertained — amused, shocked, charmed, moved, and everything in between — and captivated by a voracious kind of filmmaking that grows rarer by the day. Bachchan and Dharmendra’s magnificent duo drives the film, and also parallels the pairing of Kumar’s dignified resolve and Khan’s anarchic villainy. R.D. Burman’s soundtrack delivered nostalgic hits like “Yeh Dosti” and “Jab Tak Hai Jaan,” which drive the story rather than interrupt it, and Salim-Javed’s dialogue is quoted across India to this day. It’s extraordinary that “Sholay” became one of the most famous movies ever made, and all the more extraordinary that it earns every bit of its enduring popularity. —PK John Cassavetes, his wife Gena Rowlands, and his dear friend Peter Falk created a total explosion in 1974 with “A Woman Under the Influence,” which features some of the most searing and self-possessed screen acting of all time. Gena Rowlands’ turn as mentally anguished housewife Mabel Longhetti remains a peerless master class — an embodiment so soul-deep that it’s no exaggeration to suggest that it completely dissolves the barrier between performance and reality. But Falk holds his own as her husband Nick, who careens from serene — and sensitive to his wife’s condition — to throwdown impatience over her antics yet again, and again, and again. Originally, Rowlands and Cassavetes (who does not star in this film) envisioned “A Woman Under the Influence” as a stage play, but the intensity of Nick and Mabel’s emotional knockout fights — leading up to Mabel eventually being all but 5150ed — would surely have flattened Rowlands too greatly if she had to live it on stage multiple nights a week. Without studio backing, Cassavetes seemingly made the film with glue and paper clips, but you wouldn’t know that from the extraordinary control of craft on display, as much as “A Woman Under the Influence” doesn’t exactly present itself as a controlled film. It would be more accurate to describe it as a dizzyingly beautiful display of control being lost — of a free fall in motion. Some 50 years later we’re still waiting to hit the ground. —RL “Chinatown” is almost un-blurbable, and not only because it’s a film of such classical perfection in its Old Hollywood construction that its cavernous depths can only be fully appreciated with viewing after viewing after viewing. There’s the first viewing, where it’s easy to be taken in by its surface pleasures: John A. Alonzo’s nicotine-stain cinematography, Polanski’s apex-noir shot choices, Robert Towne’s seen-it-all dialogue, Jerry Goldsmith’s ominous lament for solo trumpet, little detective-movie touches like Gittes putting a pocket watch under a car tire to capture the time that someone’s peeled away, Faye Dunaway talking about the flaw in her iris. All of it is intoxicating. Then, maybe on the second viewing, you find yourself compelled to dig deeper into the real history of a city that literally stole its water from the poor farmers of Owens Valley in order to become “L.A.” — a city of hunger built on thirst. Only in the viewings after that do the full crepuscular depths of this film’s black beating heart fully pump their way into your own bloodstream. John Huston’s Noah Cross is immediately shocking and repellant, but it’s only with prolonged exposure that one begins to recognize how deeply the personal, sexual, and political violence Cross represents is part of the historical fabric of this country. The ultimate act of a city and a nation holding a mirror up to itself (as is usually best achieved by an outsider to both, one indelibly marked by tragedy himself in his temporary adopted country), “Chinatown” is really a mirror held up to a mirror, reflecting back a city and its dream reflections of itself over and over and over again. “Chinatown” is the famous shot of a million Charles Foster Kanes repeated to infinity in Xanadu’s mirrors as an entire feature. It’s Jimmy Stewart looking into the abyss off the bell-tower roof in “Vertigo.” It achieves that effect with a singularly devious subtlety. Chinatown” is an example of how true mastery always trumps virtuosity — restraint over flash, craft over spectacle. It’s a cinema that’s grown up, that doesn’t believe in the lies of its dreamtown or of the medium best associated with it, but finds those lies ever-intoxicating and irresistible nonetheless. And it always comes back for more. —CB Rainer Werner Fassbinder effortlessly took to science fiction in “World on a Wire,” reorienting his recurring use of reflective surfaces as a means of illustrating both surveillance-state dystopia and identity confusion over the simulation program that presents its wired-in residents a false reality. That this simulation exists not merely to produce more docile citizens, but also to act as a kind of aggressive consumer testing for capitalist interests, only further stresses the dehumanization of the premise. For all of its heady concepts, however, the film finds the director frequently cutting loose with ideas, using the excuse of a constructed reality to freely blend imagery of 20th-century Germany and pop culture. A timely disco rave rubs up against a Weimar-esque cabaret, and the soundtrack runs the gamut from a performance of Marlene Dietrich classic “The Boys in the Back Room” to Fleetwood Mac. This is one of Fassbinder’s most daring tribute/critiques of his nation’s addled and divided sense of self, at once at the cutting-edge of technology, economic growth, and culture but freighted by the immense burden of a history that lurks around every corner. —JC From the ashes of an aborted Napoleon film, Stanley Kubrick fashioned one of the most lushly beautiful movies ever made out of William Makepeace Thackeray’s picaresque novel about an Irish rogue who cons his way from lowly ruffian to nouveau riche nobility and back down again. Pioneering techniques for shooting in low-light and candlelit conditions, Kubrick and cinematographer John Alcott capture painterly landscapes worthy of Watteau and intensely detailed, densely populated interiors indebted to cheeky 18th century artist William Hogarth. Even the director’s usual icy mood and arch critical distance cannot preclude an immersive quality almost entirely unseen in period cinema to that point. Beneath the surface, though, “Barry Lyndon” is one of Kubrick’s funniest movies, wielding Ryan O’Neal’s prickly personality to reflect the way that Barry’s social-climbing schemes usually succeed through bullheaded stubbornness rather than adroit manipulation. Ryan O’Neal’s Barry is a loathsome boor who keeps failing upward, finding along the way that people at every rung of the hierarchy are equally petty and venal and differ only in their ability to dress up these flaws in politesse. —JC Djibril Diop Mambéty’s “Touki Bouki” is one of the most stylistically inventive films of the 1970s. Made on a shoestring budget in post-independence Senegal, it follows two young lovers as they scheme to escape Dakar for Paris. The film’s fragmented editing, layered sound, and erratic structure reflect the characters’ restless desire to leave — as well as their confusion about what leaving really means. Both home and destination are shaped by the same colonial past. A landmark of African cinema, “Touki Bouki” remains a singular, disillusioned portrait of youth caught between dreams and dislocation. —TO A smirking meditation on authenticity that profiles art forger Elmy de Hory, hoax biographer Clifford Irving, and Orson Welles’ Yugoslavian paramour Oja Kodar as part of an elaborate attempt to disguise its own trickery, “F for Fake” isn’t just cinema’s most playful self-portrait, it’s also its most dazzling statement of purpose. “Art is a lie that makes us see the truth,” Welles quotes Picasso as saying, and “F for Fake” offers an impossibly fitting gracenote to the career of an American titan whose work — from “The War of the Worlds” to “Citizen Kane” and beyond — hinged on the power of showmanship in a world all too eager to believe its own eyes. And ears. “For the next hour,” Welles proclaims in the first reel, “everything in this film will be based on solid fact.” But it’s the rest of time that “F for Fake” is most concerned with, and Welles’ fascination with charlatans, forgeries, and doublespeak indeed cuts deeper than ever at a time when we’re all at the mercy of our worst hucksters. To revisit this endlessly knotted Magic Eye puzzle of an essay film today is to appreciate that nothing has changed beyond the sloppiness of the world’s sleight-of-hand. As Welles says of Irving’s fraud: “It may well be the hoax of the century, but, really, this is not, you know, in any way the century of the hoax. We hanky-panky men have always been with you.” And they always will be. If only they took as much pleasure in it as Welles did. If only they gave so much of that pleasure back to us in return. —DE Released a year ahead of America’s bicentennial, Robert Altman’s panoramic view of celebrity and politics represents a high point of Altman’s experimental naturalism. Joan Tewkesbury’s script — or blueprint, given Altman’s tendency to improvise — splits the difference between New Journalism field reporting and biting social satire. The question of whether “Nashville” celebrates or condescends to the music and people of the eponymous setting still incites debates. The film’s poignant, downbeat ending recalls the political assassinations that dominated the previous decade and presages the shocking celebrity-based violence that would come to define the remainder of the century. As Altman’s film strenuously argues, everyone wants to be famous, no matter what the cost. We’re way past the point where identifying that celebrity and politics are two sides of the same coin can be considered a novel observation, but Altman never lectures the audience about the idea anyway. He merely integrates it into the infrastructure. The gap between unseen populist presidential candidate Hal Phillip Walker, whose banal observations blare through the streets like hokey pabulum, and the aspiring singers that flit through the film’s margins is as thin as paper. Only Barbara Jean (Ronee Blakley), the fragile country singer constantly on the brink of a nervous breakdown, seems to recognize that fame is merely a gateway to being used by friends and strangers alike. Like all great works, “Nashville” uses its narrow scope to probe at universal ideas—about the ways social environments breed and warp personal aspirations and how the proliferation of images permanently distorted reality. In one sense, “Nashville,” much like lothario singer Tom Frank, played by Keith Carradine, is easy, at least to describe in the abstract. But it’s much more difficult to explain the feeling of being immersed in its world. Altman and his players construct a lattice of pleasures and heartbreaks, vulnerable desires and duplicitous actions, local struggles and national wounds that rarely feel contrived or artificial. So much of the film feels like listening in on people’s lives, catching glimpses of their personalities as they move through the world, and projecting joy or sorrow onto their behavior. Altman allows his audience to get to know his characters, but he also keeps them at a crucial distance. It’s not unlike the experience of having a long chat with a stranger at a bar: you get to know them, but you will never perceive the full picture. This clash between familiar intimacy and fundamental unknowability at the heart of “Nashville” lends it a uniquely peerless quality. Fifty years later, It’s still one of a kind. —VM The first time you watch Nagisa Ōshima’s “In the Realm of the Senses,” it might seem like more of a horror movie than a love story. This is, after all, a claustrophobic — and broadly true — saga of erotic obsession from the most hostile of Japanese auteurs; a mad and scandalous work of art that’s full of unsimulated sex, peppered with a massacre’s worth of little deaths, and topped off with a scene of genital amputation so unflinching that it feels like an answer to the eyeball cut in Buñuel’s “Un Chien Andalou.” Even if you’re willing to consider that Abe Sada chops off Ishida Kichizō’s penis as an act of love and mutual liberation, it still hurts to watch. The most notorious and universal of Ōshima’s transgressions, “In the Realm of the Senses” has never been at risk of aging, but its carnal revolt against the rising tide of militarism has only become more relevant over the course of recent years, as has its naked and pungent reaction to the dangers of living in a country that’s ashamed of all the wrong stuff. “Love of a country is a strange thing,” Ōshima once said. “Just puffing out your chest with national pride and telling people how wonderful your country is does not constitute love of country as I see it. You have to tell the truth about your country, whatever it is.” Ōshima saw “In the Realm of the Senses” as a chance to seduce people into looking at themselves. It would be erotic but not titillating, arousing but not exploitative. It would offset the mucus, viscera, and verisimilitude of hardcore porn with the matter-of-factness of a nature documentary. In the end, it does all that and more. The film gradually becomes so cocooned inside its crust of dried sex that viewers start to get turned off just as they begin to realize there’s nowhere else for them to go. —DE A singularly crucial text in the myth of Werner Herzog, “Aguirre, the Wrath of God” endures as cinema’s most lucid (self)portrait of the madness that some men develop in response to the sheer poverty of their own power — in response to the hard fact that death is the only destiny that nature has put aside for them. It’s a film about how the hardness of that fact compels such men to invent a new destiny for themselves; how it gives them the will required to lead a suicide march in search of El Dorado, or in Herzog’s case the will to recreate one. The ecstatically true story of the 16th century conquistadors who splintered away from Gonzalo Pizarro’s expedition and disappeared into the Amazon rainforest, never to be seen again, “Aguirre” is steeped in a fever from its opening shots, which find the Spaniards forcing their slaves down through the clouds of the Urubamba Valley as if descending into heaven. The biblical drama of the Peruvian landscape is further exaggerated by the clinical disinterest Herzog takes in the the human folly he stages against it (a reflection of the apathy the jungle shows to us all), which is set to the novocaine-like numbness of Popol Vuh’s airy score, and unravels with the natural calm of river water floating downstream. Klaus Kinski’s feral performance as the demented Aguirre is all the more affecting for how it preserves that sense of calm amid his character’s increasingly grandiose delirium. The actor’s jagged face had long struck Herzog as the only human landscape that could fully convey the destructive indifference of nature itself, and here in the first of their violent and spectacular collaborations Kinski is so possessed by mad pride that he seems to wield the wrath of god to the same degree he suffers from it. Movie characters have never been more primitive, but in a film so cut to the bone — a film whose abject denial of poetry suffuses every scene with an inescapable unreality — Aguirre’s wide-eyed sense of purpose is no less divine than Herzog’s determination to capture it on camera. —DE Ridley Scott’s “Alien” (1979) didn’t just explode the sci-fi genre — it redefined what it meant to make a blockbuster with brains and blood. A haunting, slow-burn thriller with the visual sophistication of an art film and the unrelenting terror of a monster movie, “Alien” pushed the boundaries of genre cinema and delivered a protagonist who would go on to reshape the cinematic landscape: Ellen Ripley, played as only the brilliant Sigourney Weaver could. Weaver isn’t even the first name you see in the opening credits — that honor goes to Tom Skerritt — but by the time the credits roll, there’s no mistaking who this film belongs to. Ripley doesn’t start off as the obvious hero. She becomes one — forged in trauma, quick-thinking, and sheer will. Her emergence 45 minutes in, amid a cascade of terror, feels revolutionary even now. Scott’s decision to re-gender the lead (originally written as a man by screenwriter Dan O’Bannon) was a seismic move. In an era dominated by masculine action heroes — from “Apocalypse Now” to “Moonraker” — Ripley was a revelation: competent, logical, unshakably brave, but never stripped of her humanity. She doesn’t just survive the alien. She outwits it, outlasts it, and in doing so, becomes the rare kind of cinematic icon who actually earns her place in the pantheon. Weaver’s final showdown — flamethrower in hand, fear in her eyes — is the ultimate mic drop on a decade of genre excess. She saves the ship, the cat, herself, and maybe cinema itself. “Alien” isn’t just one of the best films of the ’70s. It’s a blueprint for how genre filmmaking can be smart, subversive, and unforgettable. Want the job done right? Send Ripley. Send “Alien.” —KE Francis Ford Coppola devotees — and Coppola himself — often like to describe “The Godfather” and “The Godfather Part II” as one single, seamless film. But that well-intentioned praise falls short of capturing what Coppola actually accomplished with his sequel. After all, the only thing harder than making “The Godfather” might be embarking on a follow-up to an era-defining film that is universally agreed to have a perfect ending. Coppola had more resources at his disposal the second time around, but the expectations were infinitely higher as well. Nevertheless, he still found a way to deliver a movie that deepens the ideas established in its predecessor without resting on its laurels or undoing any of the magic. Rather than give audiences more of the same, Coppola dove head first into a bifurcated narrative structure that illustrates the way the Corleone family’s future is inextricably linked to its past. As Al Pacino’s Michael Corleone sinks his claws deeper and deeper into a life that his father never wanted for him, relative newcomer Robert De Niro fills the massive shoes left behind by Marlon Brando in an origin story that washes away all of the lies these mafiosos tell themselves about their line of work: At the end of the day it isn’t about family or survival, but a simple raw lust for power and revenge that can never be satisfied. “Part II” will never be quoted or referenced as much as its predecessor, and it’s slightly easier to walk away from if you happen to stumble on a half-finished basic cable broadcast while flipping channels. But what it sacrifices in montage-able moments, it more than makes up for with its textual depth. The first film is a straightforward gangster movie executed at the highest possible level, but the follow-up is a morality play of cosmic proportions. Coppola never shies away from Michael’s original reluctance to seize the throne or the downsides of the job, but “Part II” rips away every semblance of glamour and shreds the family structures that made Michael’s success possible until we’re forced to discard every interpretation except the reality that none of this was worth it. If “The Godfather” is the ultimate movie about a man who decides to sell his soul, “Part II” is just as definitive a portrait of what happens when the universe shows up to collect what it’s owed. —CZ It’s “The Godfather.” Francis Ford Coppola’s 1972 masterpiece remains one of the definitive films of the ‘70s — a decade that stands for cinematic reinvention and a Hollywood-backed turn to more nuanced storytelling. More than just a “gangster movie,” it’s an operatic meditation on power, family, and corruption, wrapped in a mythic tale about the real price of the American Dream (read: pretty damn steep). And actors, boy, did we have actors back then. Marlon Brando’s unforgettable portrayal of Vito Corleone brought a weary, commanding presence to the screen, embodying the complex patriarch at the heart of this crime dynasty. Meanwhile, Al Pacino’s evolution from hesitant outsider to ruthless Mafia boss offers a masterclass in character transformation that fueled the film’s emotional core. Their performances, alongside one the best ensembles to ever be assembled on-screen, anchor a story that’s as intimate as it is epic. Coppola’s direction pairs perfectly with Gordon Willis’ iconic “shadow play” cinematography, creating a visual palette that feels both grand and suffocating — a world drenched in darkness and moral ambiguity. Nino Rota’s haunting score adds a layer of melancholy that lingers beyond the screen, turning every scene into something timeless. Even all these years on, few films have been able to so ably interrogate what it truly costs to succeed in America, exposing the price of loyalty, power, and legacy with unflinching honesty. Decades later, “The Godfather” remains a cultural touchstone, shaping not just the gangster genre but the very language of American cinema in the 1970s. It’s a film that captures the era’s restless spirit while standing as a timeless masterpiece. Not just one of the best films of the ‘70s, one of the best films of all time. We don’t see that changing any time soon. —KE Chantal Akerman’s anti-epic is a film composed of all the quotidian bits of life that are usually elided through editing, its construction foregrounding how the daily tasks we consider too boring for the silver screen are more often than not also traditionally viewed as “woman’s work.” Akerman captures every chore of Delphine Seyrig’s housewife in such excruciating detail that even her moonlighting sex work becomes just another line on the to-do list alongside preparing meals and cleaning. And yet, in its deliberate lack of incident, “Jeanne Dielman” slowly wrings tension out of the most banal variations on rigid schedules. A dropped utensil generates a jolt akin to Raymond Burr finally looking up into the camera in “Rear Window,” and a break in Jeanne’s tic of turning off the light when she leaves a room hints at a blurring of her separate lives as a housekeeper and sex worker. These infinitesimal discrepancies accumulate like chaotic fractals that prefigure an explosive finale that would feel abrupt and nonsensical without them but becomes a logical catharsis thanks to the subtle breadcrumb trail Akerman scatters over three hours. In its own way, “Jeanne Dielman” is as radical a synthesis of cinematic possibility as has ever been made, and one of the finest distillations of just how much can be communicated through blocking and precise editing over dialogue. —JC “Saló, or the 120 Days of Sodom” has been seen as a cursed object since before it first premiered in the fall of 1975, three weeks after writer-director Pier Paolo Pasolini was tortured and then killed on a beach in Ostia; his murder remains unsolved in the strictest sense, but all signs point to the crime as an expression of the same fascistic impulse that his final film so fearlessly distills into its purest form. Immediately censored, widely banned, and so enduringly controversial that the likes of Alec Baldwin was compelled to defend its honor in a legal brief as recently as 2009, “Saló” has become synonymous with the extreme, the verboten, that which is beyond the bounds of good taste. Its title is a veritable shorthand for something difficult to stomach. And yet, to recognize that some people continue to be more perturbed by Pasolini’s film than they are by the pornographic cruelties of the world that inspired him to make it is to recognize why it was necessary for him to make it in the first place. Loosely adapted from the Marquis de Sade’s “The 120 Days of Sodom,” its 18th century debaucheries updated for the final days of the Mussolini regime, “Saló” tells the story of four ghoulish libertines who kidnap 18 teenagers, abscond to a remote mansion, and subject their innocent hostages to several months of extreme degradation. The youths are at the absolute mercy of their captors, who assume total control of their bodies across a series of dehumanizing rituals that begin with rape, progress to shit-eating, and ultimately climax in a mess of medieval barbarities. Vile enough on its face, Pasolini’s film is thoroughly suffused with the soullessness of its villains (particularly Aldo Valetti’s anus-obsessed “President,” whose crooked smile is more frightening than any of the tortures Pasolini’s cast had to fake for the camera); from Ennio Morricone’s jaunty opening tune to the upsetting symmetry of Pasolini’s compositions and the persistent sense of “fun” that stains even the worst of the horrors framed within, “Saló” insists on being received as a Dantean parody of the dictatorships and puppet states that destabilized so much of the 20th century, and continue to recur throughout history. “The one true anarchy is that of power,” the fanatical Duke proclaims, and “Saló” remains cinema’s most confrontational — and therefore most necessary — vision of the perverted chaos that autocrats seek to create under the guise of state control. —DE In the dying moments of the 1970s, Bob Fosse re-centered American cinema on the personal and hyper-subjective with “All That Jazz,” shattering the end of a decade whose movies had been fiercely preoccupied with the fractiousness of the social order. Here, in his penultimate film and greatest masterpiece, Fosse’s personal demons are on full, dazzling display, as the jazz dance legend electrifyingly fictionalized how his various addictions reached a fever pitch while editing “Lenny” at the same time as he tried to mount “Chicago” on Broadway. In doing so, Fosse’s diaristic hall of mirrors pushed the entire genre of movie musical itself into the self-reflexive headspace that it’s occupied ever since (as can be seen in everything from “Dancer in the Dark” to Annette” and, naturally, “Chicago”). “All That Jazz” blends fantasy and reality — memory and delusion — to create a celluloid autobiography that remains unparalleled for its raw emotional honesty and proximity to its subject, with Roy Scheider boldly and beautifully embodying Fosse alter-ego Joe Gideon. He’s a chain-smoking, Dexedrine-popping, booze-guzzling workaholic, the kind of bottomless pit of a man who tells his girlfriend (played by Fosse’s protégé and real-life romantic partner Ann Reinking), when she says “I wish you weren’t so generous with your cock,” that he might like to use that line in a screenplay. “All That Jazz” also doubles as a sensational, shaggy backstage docudrama about the makings of Fosse’s song and dance — the script with its pierced venomous heart co-written by Robert Alan Aurthur, with Fosse choreographing the film himself. By the time Scheider is zipped up in a body bag at the movie’s end, having imagined the show of his own life in his head in his dying moments, it’s impossible not to feel winded by the experience of a wildly self-important spectacle that’s every inch as grand a portrait of an artist as “8 1/2,” “Andrei Rublev,” or “Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters.” “All That Jazz” is also the rare example of a movie musical that goes deeper than it could have on the stage, with Fosse utilizing the medium — at the height of his powers — with the reckless abandon of someone discovering it for the first time. It’s a movie that reflects all of the genius and unalloyed vision that had defined the previous decade in American film. And when Joe Gideon died, the ’70s died with him. —RL By providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy.

August 18, 2025 06:21 ET | Source: Alkane Resources Limited Alkane Resources Limited PERTH, Australia, Aug. 18, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- As originally indicated in an investor announcement dated 14 August 2025, Alkane Resources Limited (ASX: ALK; TSX: ALK; OTCQX: ALKEF) is pleased to provide the latest exploration results for drilling in the region around the Company’s Tomingley Gold Operations in Central New South Wales: Alkane Managing Director & CEO, Nic Earner, said: “We continue to explore at Tomingley within our approved mining areas and regionally, seeking to add further mine life, scale, and grade to Tomingley. It is pleasing to see the extent of mineralisation in the broader Tomingley region, and we look forward to continuing to add to our resource base.” Tomingley Gold Project Alkane Resources Ltd 100% The Tomingley Gold Project (TGP) covers an area of approximately 440 km2 stretching 60 km north-south along the Newell Highway from Tomingley in the north, through Peak Hill and almost to Parkes in the south. The TGP contains Alkane’s currently operating TGO, an open pit and underground operation with a 1 Mtpa processing facility. Over the past several years Alkane has conducted an extensive regional exploration program that led to the definition of Mineral Resources at the Roswell and San Antonio deposits (ASX Announcement 2 May 2022 and ASX Announcement 16 February 2021), separate from the established resources and reserves at TGO. Alkane has completed a 2.7 km long drive from the Wyoming One open cut to Roswell. Roswell and San Antonio now form part of TGO, with processing of ore mined from underground at Roswell beginning in April 2024. The focus for the exploration team has turned to other targets within the TGP, both near-mine and further out from TGO. Exploration over the previous 12 months for TGP comprised high-resolution drone magnetics, air-core drilling testing the Mingelo Volcanic belt between El Paso prospect and Peak Hill, and deeper RC/DD drilling testing El Paso, Tomingley Structure, and the historic Tomingley workings that are all located within 7 km of the Tomingley processing facility. As part of the recent exploration drilling, assay results were received from 233 air-core (AC) drill holes for a total of 16,693 metres; 6 reverse circulation (RC) drill holes for a total of 1,442 metres; and 6 diamond core (DD) drill holes for a total of 1,883 metres. The exploration undertaken: El Paso The El Paso prospect is ~2 km south of the San Antonio deposit (406,000 oz Au * details in appended table). Mineralisation associated with attenuated volcanic units was discovered at this prospect in 2017. Several programs of drilling intersected multiple zones of mineralisation, however the complexity of the geology, the widespread alteration and difficult drilling conditions has so far impeded the effective delineation of substantial gold resources. Four mud rotary collared DD holes were recently completed to further test significant gold mineralisation associated with a dacite volcanic unit intersected in the previous round of drilling by EPD013 – 12 m @ 1.50 g/t Au from 297 m (ASX announcement 7 October 2024). Significant gold mineralisation includes intercepts that are approximately true thickness (estimated at 90%): The dacite has a northeast strike length of over 400m, dips to the southeast and appears truncated by a subvertical north-trending shear zone along strike and down dip to the east. The dacite is believed to continue at depth to the south (west of the shear zone).The mineralisation appears to continue down dip (across the shear zone) within the volcaniclastic sediments, as a possible conduit structure to the mineralisation hosted in the dacite. A further 2,000m of mud rotary diamond core drilling is planned to begin in September to contribute to defining an exploration target for El Paso. One RC drill hole was planned to test an Au-As zone of mineralisation previously intersected by three AC drill holes, 1 km southeast of El Paso (ASX announcement 7 October 2024). Unfortunately, the RC drill hole failed to overcome the sandy alluvial overburden and underlying saprolitic regolith, terminating in gold mineralised bedrock at 124m, grading 0.22 g/t Au. Mud rotary diamond drilling is being prioritised to test this new prospect properly. EPD017 – Sericite-carbonate altered dacite with sheeted quartz-albite veins and pyrite-arsenopyrite selvages from 6.1m interval grading 3.03 g/t Au from 120.9 m. Tomingley Structure prospects The ‘Tomingley Structure’ is an Au-As mineralised structure that extends north 5km from the historic Tomingley workings and transects the Tomingley Two prospect. The Tomingley Structure was originally delineated by reconnaissance air-core drilling north of Tomingley and identified the Tomingley One and Tomingley Two prospects (ASX announcement 8 June 2004). Mineralisation associated with the structure comprises strong quartz veining/silicification and intense sericite alteration with pyrite-arsenopyrite hosted in meta-sediments. The structure is covered by shallow alluvium immediately south of the historic Tomingley workings, deepening to approximately 30 metres at Tomingley One and to over 100 metres north of Tomingley Two. Five RC drill holes for a total of 1,318 metres tested along the ‘Tomingley Structure’. Significant gold (+0.2 g/t Au) was intersected in three holes and in addition significant arsenic (+0.1 % As) was intersected in a fourth hole. The fifth RC hole did not reach target depth due to sandy alluvium bogging the rod string, terminating the hole at 148 metres. Significant gold mineralisation from the drilling includes: Work is planned at Tomingley One (e.g. TO035 – 2m @ 10.9g/t Au from 34m; ASX announcement 8 June 2004) and Tomingley Two (e.g. TORC005 – 11m @ 1.7 g/t Au from 158m including 4m @ 3.87 g/t Au from 159m; ASX announcement 16 September 2021) prospects to better characterise the structures and lithologies integral for significant gold mineralisation. Two diamond core drill holes are planned, to collect structural measurements and to define any key lithologies focussing mineralisation. Tomingley Gold Workings and near-mine exploration Two diamond core holes were completed from surface to test near-mine targets immediately north of the mining lease. Diamond hole (PATD002) targeted 600m north of the Caloma open cut to test for an extension to the andesite that hosts the majority of the Caloma gold resources (pre-mining Caloma resource 369,400 oz Au – ASX announcement 29 March 2012). The hole intersected a package of carbonaceous shales, fine-grained volcaniclastic sediments and the Caloma andesite with an estimated true thickness of 60 metres (similar thickness as observed at Caloma). Mineralised quartz veining was observed in the footwall sediments to the andesite with a best intercept of: PATD002 5 metres grading 0.44g/t Au from 80.3 metres. Whilst only minor alteration and mineralisation was observed in the andesite, PATD002 was collared to the southwest which is not optimal for targeting Caloma’s moderately west-dipping mineralisation. Further drilling in planned to target this prospective lithology with diamond drill holes collared to the east, from the west side of the Newell Highway. The historic Tomingley gold workings were targeted for the first time in Alkane’s history, with one diamond core hole (PATD001). The workings (Crowhurst & Sons Mine – 62kg Au production 1883-1911) are an estimated 117m deep, PATD001 was targeted 30 metres below this depth. The drilling intersected a package of carbonaceous shales and volcaniclastic siltstones that was host to a 30-m-thick quartz reef with significant pyrite (and trace arsenopyrite) mineralisation. The quartz reef below the workings returned a best intercept of: PATD001 9.5 metres grading 0.27 g/t Au from 175.5 metres. The historic average head grade at Crowhurst is recorded as 26 g/t Au, so there are likely strong plunge controls to any high-grade ore shoots. Structural work is underway to determine an orientation for the existence of these shoots prior to further drill-testing. Reconnaissance AC drilling 233 air-core drill holes were completed for 16,693 metres along nominal 800 m-spaced traverses to test an approximate 2 km x 7 km section of the Mingelo Volcanic Belt between El Paso prospect and Peak Hill. The section of the belt is blind, covered by alluvium ranging from only a few metres to over 50 metres. Three potential new zones of mineralisation were discovered: Southeast of El Paso – Two holes (EPAC213 - 4) intersected Au-As mineralisation in weathered basaltic andesite, approximately 1 km southeast of El Paso, and 400 m southwest of previously AC defined Au-As mineralisation.This apparent northeast mineralisation trend parallels the orientation observed at El Paso. Significant Au-As anomalism was also intersected (EPAC201 – 2, JNAC042) along the eastern margin for 800 m of the extensive basaltic-andesite unit. Best Au intercepts include: Westray – Two holes (WSAC092, 94) intersected significant Au-As anomalism in volcaniclastic sediments proximal to andesites. Best Au intercepts include: Two deeper RC or DD drill holes are planned to test the coincident AC and soils Au-As target at Westray and the El Paso SE prospect. Planned exploration program Planned exploration around the Tomingley Gold Operations (TGO) for the next 12 months comprises a high-resolution drone magnetic survey over the area surrounding and including Peak Hill to delineate fertile structures and to map new volcanic terrain beneath the cover sequence to the east of Peak Hill. Other exploration involves work at numerous prospects, including 6,000m of deeper RC/DD drilling, comprising: El Paso, El Paso SE, Tomingley One, Tomingley Two, Caloma North (orogenic Au) – diamond drilling; Glen Isla (epithermal Au) – mapping, induced polarisation (IP) survey and diamond drilling; Westray (orogenic Au) – RC drilling; Reconnaissance, McGregors (orogenic Au) – air-core drilling; Gundong (magmatic Ni, orogenic Au) – air-core drilling; Trewilga (orogenic Au) – soil sampling. In parallel with routine grade control surface drilling at the planned San Antonio open cuts and underground drilling at Roswell underground, a significant underground drilling program is testing McLeans, Roswell North and the Roswell Western Monzodiorite. These results are anticipated in October. * hole finished in mineralisation. ** hole abandoned early. True widths are approximately 90% (El Paso) and 60% (Tomingley Two and Tomingley Workings) of intercept width.

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change Quote of the Week: “I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something.” — Richard Feynman Number of the Week: 93% pre-industrial? THIS WEEK: By Ken Haapala, President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP) Scope: TWTW begins with the highlights of Andrew Bolt’s interview of Steven Koonin then continues with a discussion of key issues in the report by the Climate Working Group to the Secretary of Energy. TWTW concludes with a discussion of increasing greenhouse gases today. ********************* Koonin Interviews: John Robson posted his long interview of Steven Koonin on Climate Change Nexus. Also, Paul Homewood posted an interview of Koonin by Andrew Bolt. Koonin is one of the five independent scientists who participated in the Climate Working Group that produced special report prepared for the US Department of Energy (DOE) titled ‘A Critical Review of Impacts of Greenhouse Gas Emissions on the U.S. Climate.’ Koonin was formerly Obama’s Under Secretary for Science, Department of Energy: The Bolt interview is short and succinct. Among the key points Koonin made are: TWTW has reviewed independent comments from three of the five scientists comprising the Climate Working Group concerning their report. Thus far, there appears to be no comments from John Christy or Ross McKitrick. No one has suggested that anyone in the Department of Energy interfered with the preparation or publication of the report. As the preface of the report states: ‘This document originated in late March 2025 when Secretary Wright assembled an independent group to write a report on issues in climate science relevant for energy policymaking, including evidence and perspectives that challenge the mainstream consensus. We agreed to undertake the work on the condition that there would be no editorial oversight by the Secretary, the Department of Energy, or any other government personnel. This condition has been honored throughout the process, and the writing team has worked with full independence.’[Boldface added] See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy. ********************* Review of the Climate Working Group Report (Part 1): The body of “A Critical Review of Impacts of Greenhouse Gas Emissions on the U.S. Climate” opens with: ‘Part I: Direct Human Influence On Ecosystems and the Climate I Carbon Dioxide as a Pollutant Chapter summary: Carbon dioxide (CO2) differs in many ways from the so-called Criteria Air Pollutants. It does not affect local air quality and has no human toxicological implications at ambient levels. It is an issue of concern because of its effects on the global climate.’ After discussing the Clean Air Act of 1970 and the six so-called Criteria Air Contaminants subject to EPA regulation the chapter concludes with: ‘Ambient outdoor air today contains about 430 parts per million (ppm) CO2, increasing at about 2 ppm per year. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration issues guidelines for indoor workplaces in which elevated CO2 might be encountered, such as where dry ice is used. The Permissible Exposure Limit is 5,000 ppm over 8 hours (OSHA, 2024). Allen et al. (2015) reported evidence of diminished performance on some cognitive tasks among workers in office cubicles when exposed to CO2 levels above 1,000-1,500 ppm. These levels are far larger than any plausible ambient outdoor value through the end of the 22nd century. The growing amount of CO2 in the atmosphere directly influences the earth system by promoting plant growth (global greening), thereby enhancing agricultural yields, and by neutralizing ocean alkalinity. But the primary concern about CO2 is its role as a greenhouse gas (GHG) that alters the earth’s energy balance, warming the planet. How the climate will respond to that influence is a complex question that will occupy much of this report.’ [Boldface added] The next chapter starts with: ‘2 Direct Impacts of CO2 on the Environment Chapter summary: CO2 enhances photosynthesis and improves plant water use efficiency, thereby promoting plant growth. Global greening is due in part to increased CO2 levels in the atmosphere is well-established on all continents. CO2 absorption in sea water makes the oceans less alkaline. The recent decline in pH is within the range of natural variability on millennial time scales. Most ocean life evolved when the oceans were mildly acidic. Decreasing pH might adversely affect corals, although the Australian Great Barrier Reef has shown considerable growth in recent years. TWTW is uncertain about the statement “Most ocean life evolved when the oceans were mildly acidic” with a pH slightly below 7. Most ocean life may have may have evolved with a pH slightly above 7, mildly alkaline. But this is a minor point of uncertainty, not a contention. The chapter continues with: 2.1 CO2 as a contributor to global greening The growing CO2 concentration in the atmosphere has the important positive effect of promoting plant growth by enhancing photosynthesis and improving water use efficiency. That is evident in the ‘global greening’ phenomenon discussed below, as well as in the improving agricultural yields discussed in Chapter 10. Here we focus just on CO2 fertilization; research on combined effects due to temperature and precipitation changes are discussed in Chapter 10. 2.1.1 Measurement of global greening ‘Greening’ refers to an increase in the fraction of the Earth’s surface covered by plants. It can be quantified by the ‘Leaf Area Index’ (LAI) measured by satellite. Many studies over the past decade have confirmed a global greening pattern (increase in LAI) attributable in part to rising CO2 levels. Zhu et al. (2016) was one of the first studies to report that global greening was detectable using satellite sensors. From 1982 to 2011 they detected greening over 25-50 percent of the Earth versus ‘browning’ over only four percent and attributed 70 percent of the greening to rising CO2 levels (see Figure 2.1). Other contributors included land-use changes, warming and nitrogen. The fraction attributable to CO2 was largest in the tropics; other factors played more dominant roles in CONUS.’ Here we see the tremendous difference between this report and the UN IPCC and US National Climate Assessment reports. Reports on the effects of CO2 that ignore the importance of global greening have major omissions that are a form of “cherry picking” leading to highly biased conclusions. As the Climate Working Group report states: 2.1.4 CO2 fertilization benefits in IPCC Reports “The IPCC has only minimally discussed global greening and CO2 fertilization of agricultural crops. The topic is briefly acknowledged in a few places in the body of the IPCC 6th and earlier Assessment Reports but is omitted in all Summary documents. Section 2.3.4.3.3 of the AR6 Working Group I report, entitled “global greening and browning,” points out that the IPCC Special Report on Climate Change and Land had concluded with high confidence that greening had increased globally over the past 2-3 decades. It then discusses that there are variations in the greening trend among data sets, concluding that while they have high confidence greening has occurred, they have low confidence in the magnitude of the trend. There are also brief mentions of CO2 fertilization effects and improvements in water use efficiency in a few other chapters in the AR6 Working Groups I and II Reports. Overall, however, the Policymaker Summaries, Technical Summaries, and Synthesis Reports of AR5 and AR6 do not discuss the topic.” [Boldface added] The chapter continues with: “2.2 The Alkaline Oceans 2.2.1 Changing pH. A neutral aqueous solution has a pH of 7.0, while one with pH greater than 7.0 is alkaline (also termed basic) and with pH less than 7.0 is acidic. The modern-day global average pH of surface sea water is estimated to be 8.04 (Copernicus Marine Service 2025, Figure 2.3), down from an estimated value of 8.2 in pre-Industrial times (Gattuso and Hansson, 2011). As CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere increased, the oceans absorbed more, which decreases their pH. Depending upon the oceans’ buffering capacity, they are expected to become somewhat less alkaline over time, consistent with the observed decrease in pH.” Figure 2.3 is omitted here but in the text. “While this process is often called ‘ocean acidification,’ that is a misnomer because the oceans are not expected to become acidic; ‘ocean neutralization’ would be more accurate. Even if the water were to turn acidic, it is believed that life in the oceans evolved when the oceans were mildly acidic with pH 6.5 to 7.0 (Krissansen-Totton et al., 2018). On the time scale of thousands of years, boron isotope proxy measurements show that ocean pH was around 7.4 or 7.5 during the last glaciation (up to about 20,000 years ago) increasing to present-day values as the world warmed during deglaciation (Rae et al., 2018). Thus, ocean biota appears to be resilient to natural long-term changes in ocean pH since marine organisms were exposed to wide ranges in pH.” The Climate Working Group refutes the fear of “ocean acidification” promoted by NOAA during the Obama administration. Indeed, there are sections of the oceans above geothermal vents where the waters are acidic, pH below 7, where shellfish and other marine life live. The chapter concludes with: “In summary, ocean life is complex and much of it evolved when the oceans were acidic relative to the present. The ancestors of modern coral first appeared about 245 million years ago. CO2 levels for more than 200 million years afterward were many times higher than they are today. Much of the public discussion of the effects of ocean ‘acidification’ on marine biota has been one-sided and exaggerated.” [Boldface added] Chapter 3 begins with: “3 Human Influences on the Climate Chapter Summary: The global climate is naturally variable on all time scales. Anthropogenic CO2 emissions add to that variability by changing the total radiative energy balance in the atmosphere. The IPCC has downplayed the role of the sun in climate change but there are plausible solar irradiance reconstructions that imply it contributed to recent warming. Climate projections are based on IPCC emission scenarios that have tended to exceed observed trends. Most academic climate impact studies in recent years are based upon the extreme RCP 8.5 scenario that is now considered implausible; its use as a business-as-usual scenario has been misleading. Carbon cycle models connect annual emissions to growth in the atmospheric CO2 stock. While models disagree over the rate of land and ocean CO2 uptake, all agree that it has been increasing since 1959. There is evidence that urbanization biases in the land warming record have not been completely removed from climate data sets. 3.1 Components of radiative forcing and their history 3.1.1 Historical radiative forcing A changing climate has been the norm throughout the Earth’s 4.6-billion-year history. The Earth’s temperature and weather patterns change naturally over timescales ranging from decades to millions of years. Natural variations in the surface climate originate in two ways. Internal climate fluctuations associated with circulations in the atmosphere and ocean exchange energy, water, and carbon between the atmosphere, oceans, land, and ice. External influences on the climate system include variations in the energy received from the sun and the effects of volcanic eruptions. Human activities influence climate through changing land use and land cover. Humans are also changing the composition of the atmosphere by emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases and by altering the concentration of aerosol particles in the atmosphere. The earth is warmed by the sunlight it absorbs and is cooled by the heat it radiates to space. Averaged over the Earth’s surface, each of these processes involve power flows of about 240 Watts per square meter (W/m2). When they are in balance, there are no net external causes of warming or cooling. Both human and natural influences on the climate alter this balance and so cause the climate to change.” The Climate Working Group report presents graphs from the UN IPCC report AR6 (2021) [not shown here] then states: “These graphs show that the total radiative forcing is comprised of both natural and anthropogenic components. Carbon dioxide is the largest human influence on the climate and the one most relevant to the influence of fossil fuel use. It exerts a warming influence by decreasing the cooling power of the atmosphere. Emissions of CO2 are accumulating in the atmosphere, as described in the following section, so that the warming influence is growing. Other greenhouse gases (methane, nitrous oxide, halogens, and ozone) act similarly, currently adding another 75 percent to CO2’s warming. Aerosols exert an overall cooling effect, although with large uncertainties in the way they catalyze the formation of reflective clouds. As a result, understanding the causes of recent warming requires not just identifying the warming effects of CO2, but also the more uncertain cooling effects of aerosols.” [Boldface added] It should be noted here that the Climate Working Group is discussing what the UN IPCC asserts, not what it necessarily accepts. As stated in the last TWTW, the global climate modelers assert that the modest warming from CO2 will be amplified by an equal warming from increasing water vapor and other warming such as methane, nitrous oxide, etc. The modelers have failed to produce the physical evidence demonstrating that this additional warming from other atmospheric gases is taking place. Periods of strong warming may be due to changes in the intensity of the sunlight hitting the surface of Earth, changes in ocean circulation, or other natural changes. This section of Chapter 3 concludes with: “Figure 3.1.1 [not shown here] shows that the anthropogenic forcing component was negligible before about 1900 and has increased steadily since, rising to almost 3 W/m2 today. However, this is still only about 1 percent of the unperturbed radiation flows, making it a challenge to isolate the effects of anthropogenic forcing; state of-the-art satellite estimates of global radiative energy flows are only accurate to a few W/m2. . Natural sources of global energy imbalance other than volcanoes and total solar irradiance (TSI) are not included in these [UN IPCC] graphs because they remain largely unknown.” [Boldface added] The Climate Working Group report continues with discussions of changes in atmospheric CO2 since 1958 as measured by Mauna Loa observatory and Future emission scenarios and the carbon cycle. A key paragraph in the discussion of the carbon cycle is: “The main processes that remove excess CO2 from the atmosphere are increased growth of land vegetation (especially at high latitudes), some increase in the sequestering of carbon in soils, and uptake of CO2 by the ocean due to the increasing partial pressure of atmospheric CO2 over that of CO2 dissolved in the ocean. All twenty land carbon cycle models tracked by the Global Carbon Project (Friedlingstein et al., 2024) show land processes have been removing excess CO2 at an increasing rate since 1959. This is consistent with a ‘global greening’ phenomenon (Chapter 2.1) observed by satellites since monitoring of global greenness began in 1982.” [Boldface added] In the section Urbanization influence on temperature trends, the Climate Working Group states the UN IPCC reports largely ignore the Urban Heat Island effect (UHI) despite increasing evidence and reports that they are significant. The section and chapter conclude with: “The challenge in measuring UHI bias is relating local temperature change to a corresponding change in population or urbanization, rather than to a static classification variable such as rural or urban. Spencer et al. (2025) used newly available historical population archives to undertake such an analysis and found evidence of significant UHI bias in U.S. summertime temperature data. In summary, while there is clear warming in the land record, there is also evidence that it is biased upward by patterns of urbanization and that these biases have not been completely removed by the data processing algorithms used to produce climate data sets.” The next TWTW will discuss the Climate Working Group report on Climate Response to CO2 Emissions to include Climate Sensitivity to CO2 Forcing and Discrepancies Between Models and Instrumental Observations. ********************* Towards Understanding the Importance of Increasing Greenhouse Gases: Kenneth Richard of No Tricks Zone discusses the paper “Unsettling the settled: simple musings on the complex climatic system” by Demetris Koutsoyiannis and George Tsakalias. The paper is an interesting thought experiment presenting physical evidence, not a hypothesis. In part, the abstract states: Our revisit of fundamental issues of climate challenges the notion and term of the “greenhouse effect,” and attempts a scientific reevaluation using minimal assumptions, such as Newton’s laws, maximum entropy, and gas spectroscopy. It replaces terms like “greenhouse gas” with “radiatively active gas” (RAG) and “greenhouse effect” with “atmospheric radiative effect” (ARE). While ARE exist in several planets’ atmospheres, on Earth it is primarily driven by water vapor and clouds, with CO2 playing a minor role (especially anthropogenic CO2 which represents 4% of total emissions). The paper discusses the works of van Wijngaarden and Happer. Then it later states: “3.5 What factors can explain the observed temperature profile? Given the analysis of the previous subsection, it becomes clear that it is not the ARE that creates and maintains the temperature gradient. Rather the mechanisms responsible for the temperature gradient are: • the warming of the soil and liquid water by the sunshine during the day and their cooling during the night; • the water evaporation and transpiration at the surface level and condensation aloft; • the convection, and the implied vertical transfer of sensible and latent heat; • the winds caused by spatial temperature differences and influenced by Coriolis forces. These are not static forcings, but processes, i.e., perpetual changes in the climatic system. The processes occur on different time scales, some of which are too small to drive the atmosphere to the equilibrium (isothermal) state. It is noted that the processes occur at a macroscopic level, with the motion of masses of air, typically referred to as parcels. And as noted by van Wijngaarden and Happer (2023), because of the very small thermal conductivity of air, it takes a very long time for appreciable heat to flow into or out of a parcel of reasonable size. The driving mechanisms of these processes are the following: 1. Clouds form and disappear, strongly affecting the SW and LW radiation processes. 2. The Earth’s surface is not homogeneous in terms of radiation absorption and reflection (varying albedo). The massive presence of water in liquid and solid phases with different albedo values, both on the Earth’s surface (hydrosphere, cryosphere) and in the atmosphere (clouds) is responsible for spatial and temporal variations in the albedo, as well as in the thermodynamic properties of different parts of the Earth. 3. Earth is round (not flat) and the sunrays come with different slopes at different places. 4. Earth rotates around its axis on a daily basis. 5. Earth rotates around the Sun on an annual basis. 6. Earth’s orbit around the Sun is elliptical, resulting in changes in the distance between the two bodies. 7. The climatic system is complex and is subject to irregular changes.” The paper ends with: “4 Discussion and conclusions The research presented here challenges the ideas that we live in a greenhouse and that science can be settled and revisits the most fundamental topics related to climate. This is attempted in the simplest possible way and using the fewest premises, such as Newton’s laws, the principle of maximum entropy and the spectroscopic properties of gases. Additionally, the study proposes that commonly used vocabulary should be replaced by rigorous scientific terminology, the main examples being “greenhouse gas” and “greenhouse effect”, which could be replaced by “radiatively active gas” (RAG, comprising water vapor—WV—and non-condensing radiatively active gases—NC-RAGs) and “atmospheric radiative effect” (ARE), respectively. The conclusions of the analyses presented here can be summarized as follows: • There is an empirically verified ARE in the atmosphere, not only on Earth but also on the other planets. On Earth, ARE is dominated by WV and clouds, with CO2 playing a very minor role—let alone human added CO2 which represents only 4% of the total emissions to the atmosphere. [Boldface added] • Equilibrium thermodynamics clearly show (either using the principle of maximum entropy, or stochastic simulation of molecule collisions) that Earth’s atmosphere would be isothermal at the equilibrium, with or without RAGs. In an isothermal atmosphere the temperature would be slightly higher than 250 K, a value which represents the vertically average temperature of the standard atmosphere over the troposphere and stratosphere. • The fact is that the atmosphere is not isothermal. Rather, the troposphere has a vertical temperature gradient of about 6.5 K/km, which is imprinted in the standard atmosphere. The gradient is resultant of macroscopic changes that drive the atmosphere out of equilibrium. While the moist adiabatic changes play a role in shaping this gradient, they cannot fully predict real atmospheric conditions. • The mean surface temperature of 288 K, also imprinted in the standard atmosphere, is much higher than the equilibrium temperature. While RAGs (mostly WV and clouds) play a role in yielding this temperature, the critical factor is the vertical temperature gradient, without which the ARE alone would not be able to increase the equilibrium temperature. • Given the importance of the atmospheric temperature gradient, which is described by large-scale atmospheric thermodynamics, rather than radiative physics, it is puzzling that the emphasis in climate research has been on the latter. This gradient is not a universal constant, but it varies with space and time. It is therefore useful to monitor and analyze its changes. The data show that since 1950 the gradient has weakened in the tropics and grown in the polar areas resulting in decrease of the surface equator-to-pole gradient, as expected in global warming conditions. A final point worth stressing is that in complex systems, such as the climatic system, observational data are the only scientific test bed for making hypotheses and assessing their validity. Focusing on one of the factors affecting the climatic system, namely, the anthropogenic CO2 emissions, and basing on models that emphasize this factor, may distort our perception of the big picture and be detrimental to science, whose objective is to pursue the truth.” [Boldface added] TWTW disagrees with “let alone human added CO2 which represents only 4% of the total emissions to the atmosphere.” The estimated CO2 level during the last interglacial warm period 130,000 to 115,000 years ago was 260 to 280 ppmv, Since 1958, the atmospheric CO2 as measured at Mauna Loa has increased from less than 320 ppmv to over 420 ppmv. Other than human emissions, there is no satisfactory explanation for this increase. However, TWTW agrees with the substance of the paper and the importance of CO2 on weather is overemphasized by politicians and others who claim that by controlling CO2 emissions they can control the weather and climate. They cannot. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy. ********************* Number of the Week: 93% pre-industrial? Many commentators seem to be confused by the concept of saturation as discussed in the works of van Wijngaarden and Happer. Discussed in last week’s TWTW, Howard Hayden’s paper has an excellent graph depicting saturation (Figure 14: Net IR blockage (seen from top of atmosphere) by CO2 versus CO2 concentration, adapted from van Wijngaarden & Happer.) A very small amount of CO2 accounts for the first 10 W/m2 of blocking and less than 50 ppmv accounts for more than 20 W/m2 of blocking. The effectiveness of additional units declines as the number of units increases. At less than 100 ppmv of CO2 in the atmosphere it is said to be saturated. This means that virtually all the radiative energy in the particular frequencies (or wavelengths) that CO2 most readily absorbs and emits radiation is being absorbed and emitted. CO2’s effectiveness is limited, and higher concentrations of CO2 have limited effectiveness. If we accept that the pre-industrial CO2 was about 280 ppmv, using Hayden’s figure we can estimate that by 280 ppmv about 93% of today’s warming effect of CO2 was occurring in pre-industrial times. The human influence is small. Note that these calculations are for clear skies. See links under Challenging the Orthodoxy – Radiation Transfer and Challenging the Orthodoxy.

When placed on the grid, solar power can trigger blackouts.] Communicating Better to the Public – Use Propaganda Turns Out Major Climate Study Peddled By Media Relied On Bunk Data By Audrey Streb, Daily Caller, Aug 7, 20225 Expanding the Orthodoxy No end in sight to plastic pollution crisis as treaty negotiations in Geneva fail By Jennifer McDermott, AP, Aug 15, 2025 That draft, released early Friday, did not include a limit on plastic production, but recognized that current levels of production and consumption are “unsustainable” and global action is needed. Questioning European Green Choosing the Positive Reality of Hydrocarbons Over ‘Green’ Fantasies By Vijay Jayaraj, CO2 Coalition, Aug 14, 2025 https://co2coalition.org/2025/08/14/https-californiaglobe-com-articles-choosing-the-positive-reality-of-hydrocarbons-over-green-fantasies/ British multinational BP has announced its largest oil and gas discovery in 25 years in Brazil’s Santos Basin. By 2030, daily production is expected to be 2.3 to 2.5 million barrels of oil equivalent, which leaves little doubt that the company is solidly committed to hydrocarbons after a brief flirtation with alternatives like wind and solar energy. UK’s AI ambitions clash with its climate goals By Staff, DYNYUZ.com, Aug 10, 2025 [H/t Bernie Kepshire] Climate Ghouls By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, Aug 12, 2025 13-minute Video Litigation Issues Green groups sue Trump administration over report downplaying climate damage By Rachel Frazin, The Hill, Aug 12, 2025 In a new lawsuit filed Tuesday, the Environmental Defense Fund and Union of Concerned Scientists challenge a new federal report that claimed climate models contain “exaggerated projections of future warming” and that “CO2-induced warming might be less damaging economically than commonly believed.” “They have done so through a plan hatched and carried out in secret. In March 2025, shortly after being confirmed to office, Secretary of Energy Christopher Wright quietly arranged for five hand-picked skeptics of the effects of climate change to form a Climate Working Group,” the suit alleged.

The Hidden Net Zero Tax By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Aug 13, 2025 The Telegraph has finally woken up to the damage to the economy being wrought by the pernicious carbon tax: Subsidies and Mandates Forever Treasury Department sets limits on remaining wind and solar tax credits By Rachel Frazin, The Hill, Aug 15, 2025 The Trump administration’s new guidance, however, sets further restrictions on which projects are considered having begun construction. It says that construction of these projects must be “continuous.” It also defines “having begun construction” as having done “physical work of a significant nature.” This includes activities like manufacturing equipment and excavating land to begin placing equipment in it. But it excludes activities like only having done surveys, test drilling or excavation for purposes of altering the landscape. [SEPP Comment: You cannot pour one foundation of a 200-unit project, then walk away for ten years hoping the market conditions improve?] EPA and other Regulators on the March Ending the Climate Confessional: Trump Administration Brings Sanity to EPA’s Emissions Database By Charles Rotter, WUWT, Aug 10, 2025 “The Environmental Protection Agency’s decision to stop updating its ‘Supply Chain Greenhouse Gas Emission Factors’ database marks a turning point away from the ritualized burden of corporate ‘climate confessions’ toward a more streamlined, reality-based approach to governance.” Energy Issues – Non-US EMBER Electricity Price Data Tool By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Aug 14, 2025 EMBER, let me stress, is a left wing, pro-renewable think tank, as their website makes clear: “We’re a global energy think tank that accelerates the clean energy transition with data and policy.” What makes this EMBER tool so valuable is that it is authoritative and can be simply wheeled out every time the renewable lobby claims that wind power costing £117/MWh is somehow cheaper than gas.

FERC Must Seize the Supreme Court’s Energy Opportunity By Dan Brouillette, Real Clear Energy, August 12, 2025 Environmental groups have weaponized NEPA reviews to block industrial projects across the board—fossil fuels, nuclear, wind, solar, and battery storage alike—using speculative consequences that stretch far beyond any reasonable connection to the actual proposal. The Court has now told federal judges to stop enabling this abuse. U.S. Exports Nearly One-Third of Its Energy Production, EIA Reports By Staff, Finance and Money, Aug 15, 2025 Power-Bill Crisis Spreads From Maryland To New Jersey, May Doom Democrats As ‘Green’ Implodes By Tyler Durden, Zero Hedge, Aug 14, 2025 [Bernie Kepshire] Electric power fantasies collide out West By David Wojick, CFACT, Aug 11, 2025 New York’s Official Energy Plan Is No Plan By Francis Menton, Manhattan Contrarian, Aug 11, 2025 Link to: Power Trends 2025 By Staff, New York Independent System Operator (NYISO), 2025 From Menton: But then NYISO is the one agency here that actually has the responsibility to keep the system up and running. Deeply buried on page 14 as the last paragraph of a section headed “A diverse resource mix supports grid reliability,” we find these two sentences: “Simply put, as New York seeks to retire more fossil fuel units in the coming years it will be essential to deploy new energy resources with the same reliability attributes to maintain grid reliability. Until new, non-emitting alternatives like hydrogen or advanced nuclear generation are developed and commercialized, fossil resources are needed to fill an essential role in preserving reliable grid operations.” Well as of today grid-scale hydrogen and advanced nuclear generation have not been “commercialized.” So, the only answer is to keep the fossil fuel generation going. Perhaps they should tell some of their co-bureaucrats, like NYSERDA, or the Energy Planning Board, or maybe even the Legislature or the New York City Council. But as of now NYISO’s strategy seems to be to put a warning somewhere deep in their reports just so they can say “I told you so” when the whole thing falls apart. They owe the New York citizenry much better. Caterpillar Among Groups Working on Massive Utah Data Center Campus By Darrell Proctor, Power Mag, Aug 7, 2025 The groups in a news release wrote, “The project will deliver groundbreaking prime power and integrated combined cooling heat and power [CCHP] solutions with a by-design liquid cooling architecture. Powered by a fleet of Caterpillar’s latest G3520K generator sets and support equipment, the distributed generation system produces electricity and captures waste heat to power and cool next-generation, high-density server systems.” [SEPP Comment: Not mentioned in the article is that the G3520K generator is powered by natural gas.] Oil and Natural Gas – the Future or the Past? Meta-Analysis of Over 100 Studies Shows Gas Stoves Pose No Increased Risks of Asthma It turns out, pushing unrealistic green energy schemes onto low- and middle-income people at the expense of a safer fuel source was not only bad science, it was dangerous propaganda. By Leslie Eastman, Legal Insurrection, Aug 8, 2025 Norway Restarts North Sea Drilling By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Aug 15, 2025 Norway became Britain’s primary source of gas last year as UK output shrank in the wake of the windfall tax and a ban on new licenses. The latest move is likely to see Norway sell even more supplies to the UK after its energy minister, Terje Aasland, said new licenses would allow it to be “a long-term supplier of oil and gas to Europe”. BP Reopen “Uneconomic” North Sea Oil Field By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, Aug 10, 2025 What is significant is here is the introduction of new technologies to make all this possible.

Climate Lawyers Try a New Approach Heatstroke killed Julie Leon on a 108-degree day. A lawsuit blames oil companies. By Mike Toth, WSJ, Aug. 11, 2025 TWTW Summary; The research fellow at the Civitas Institute of the University of Texas Austin begins with: “Stung by a recent losing streak in state courts, the foundations, academics and trial lawyers behind the climate lawfare movement are now trying a new tactic: wrongful-death lawsuits against oil and gas companies based on the alleged connection between carbon emissions and weather-related deaths. Such efforts won’t stop until the Supreme Court affirms the federal government’s exclusive regulatory authority over interstate emissions. The leading such case, Leon v. Exxon Mobil, seeks to hold energy companies liable for the death of Julie Leon, who suffered heatstroke in her car in June 2021 after driving almost 100 miles without air conditioning on a day when temperatures hit a record-breaking 108 degrees in western Washington state. The complaint was filed in state court in May on behalf of Leon’s estate. [Boldface added] Climate lawfare previously centered on lawsuits by blue states and municipalities, which sought to transform the nation by forcing energy companies to make sweeping changes or bankrupting them with damages. These cases were based on state tort theories like public nuisance and consumer fraud. The plaintiffs maintained that energy companies deceived the public about the environmental consequences of their products, which accelerated climate change and caused harms such as wildfires and floods, which adversely affected states and cities. Even assuming these allegations are true, this theory turns the Constitution on its head. The federal government—not the states—regulates interstate activity. This means that Honolulu, Boulder, Colo., and other municipal climate-change plaintiffs can dictate local carbon policies, but they can’t decide energy policy for the U.S. as a whole. That’s Congress’s job. Judges around the country agreed. State judges in Maryland, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania have dismissed climate claims this year on jurisdictional grounds. As the Pennsylvania court noted: “Today we join a growing chorus of state and federal courts across the United States singing from the same hymnal, in concluding that the claims raised by Bucks County are not judiciable by any state court in Pennsylvania.” The Supreme Court has yet to close the door on such misuse of state-law claims. In January the justices declined to take up an appeal from the city of Honolulu’s lawsuit seeking to hold oil and gas companies liable for out-of-state conduct under state tort and consumer-protection law. With the justices so far unwilling to pre-empt the use of state tort law to regulate emissions nationwide, climate litigants are ginning up new legal claims like wrongful death. Plaintiffs who assert a link between extreme weather events and climate change still need to prove causation, which may never happen.” The article discusses issues with proving causation, then continues with. “Days before the lawsuit was filed, the Leon estate’s lawyer, Timothy Bechtold, helped the left-wing impact litigators at Our Children’s Trust seek millions in fees from a landmark Montana state court ruling that 16 youth plaintiffs were injured by climate change. Beyond wrongful-death claims, which can result only in money damages, influential climate advocates are already making the case that energy executives should face homicide prosecutions for deaths purportedly caused by climate change. Whether or not the Leon estate’s claims prevail, enterprising climate lawyers will continue to bring state claims over extreme weather events until the Supreme Court affirms the federal government’s regulatory authority of interstate emissions. Meantime, an industry vital to the nation’s economy and security will continue to operate at the whim of left-wing state courts.” TWTW Comment: The Montana case relied on a clause in the Montana constitution claiming a right to a stable climate, which has never existed, an example of illusory rights.

August 17, 2025 21:00 ET | Source: Faraday Future Faraday Future PEBBLE BEACH, Calif., Aug. 17, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc. (NASDAQ: FFAI) (“Faraday Future”, “FF” or “Company”), a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company, announced that it has officially launched its transformative “EAI + Crypto” Dual-Flywheel & Dual-Bridge Ecosystem Strategy — marking the beginning of a new chapter in AI mobility and Web3 integration. This bold strategic initiative, which was revealed on August 16 at an event in Pebble Beach, integrates Embodied AI (EAI) with the explosive growth of the crypto asset economy to create a two-way, independently operating circular growth engine between Web2 and Web3, positioning FF at the forefront of the next era in global industrial and financial evolution. A replay of the announcement can be found here: https://www.ff.com/us/2025-pebble-beach/ EAI + Crypto Dual Flywheel: A New Growth Paradigm Faraday Future believes that AI represents the next great leap in productivity, while Crypto and Web3 signify a revolution in the relations of production. Together, these forces offer a potential once-in-decades opportunity for transformation — a meta-chemistry that FF aims to drive through its newly launched strategy. “The next decade could be a super long bull cycle for the crypto market,” said Ian Calderon, FF Co-Creation Officer and Founding Board Member of the California Blockchain Working Group. “FF is building a dual-engine circular growth system — combining the long-cycle, high-value EAI EV ecosystem with the short-cycle, high-velocity Crypto ecosystem. These two flywheels will empower each other, redefining what’s possible in mobility and financial innovation.” “Today's launch is a powerful example of our state's pioneering spirit, bringing together intelligent electric vehicles, blockchain, and the worlds of Web 2 and Web 3, along with industry, capital and technology,” said Fiona Ma, California State Treasurer. “This model has the potential to boost our economy, create high quality jobs, attract top tier investment, and advance sustainable development worldwide.” Building the Bridge Between Web2 and Web3 FF’s Dual-Bridge Strategy positions the Company as one of the first U.S.-listed public companies directly connecting real-world business operations with on-chain assets. Plans are underway to launch the EAI Vehicle Chain, enabling tokenized vehicle sales, crypto-based deposits, and Web3-native user engagement — while leveraging blockchain technology to create a decentralized and transparent mobility economy. “The Dual-Flywheel & Dual-Bridge Strategy reflects our deep insights into the future of the global economy,” said YT Jia, Founder & Co-CEO of Faraday Future. “FF is not just transitioning into a Web3 era — we are architecting it. This is how we deliver value creation for our stockholders.” Introducing the C10 Index and C10 Treasury: A New Crypto Infrastructure for Capital Markets FF also officially announced the C10 Index, a market-cap-weighted basket of the world’s top 10 crypto assets (excluding stablecoins), calculated from midnight Pacific Time on August 16, 2025, with a base value of 1,000. The Index will be tracked in real-time on FF.com and the FF App. Accompanying the Index, the FFAI C10 Treasury is being launched — targeting $500M to $1B in initial crypto asset purchases, subject to securing necessary funding, with an initial $30M purchase. Assets will be allocated using an 80% passive, 20% active strategy. The treasury is designed to provide sustainable returns, with staking yields estimated at 3%–5%, which can fund product innovation, potential stock buybacks, and further asset growth. FF is also exploring creating an ETF product based on the C10 Index. Crypto Flywheel to Reshape Faraday Future’s Financial Structure The Crypto Flywheel strategy, which the Company intends to operate through a wholly owned and independently managed subsidiary, FFAI Crypto Treasury and Bridging Holdings Inc., is designed to enhance FF’s income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow. With on-chain assets serving as both reserves and flexible capital, the strategy enables FF to generate stable staking yields, potentially reducing reliance on high-cost financing, and improve net asset value and structure. Structure Ensures Risk Isolation and Transparency FF’s crypto and EV businesses are planned to be operated under separate legal and financial structures to promote risk isolation, operational independence, and asset transparency. Digital assets will be held by third-party custodians and will be fully verifiable on-chain. The structure is designed to allow strategic synergies without direct cross-subsidization — while reinforcing each other. With this launch, Faraday Future offers investors access to potential dual benefits from the AI mobility and crypto asset markets. This revolutionary move supports the Company’s long-standing commitment to maximize stockholder value in a future-forward and sustainable manner. ABOUT FARADAY FUTURE Faraday Future is a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company.

ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster, Contributor. Remember a few months ago, when the “buy Europe” trade was red hot? Well, if you’re like me, you’re wondering where all the hype went! Now “buy America” is back on, but European markets are still sky-high—well ahead of their American cousins. That spells trouble for anyone with a portfolio that’s still tilted too much toward Europe. So today we’re going to look into where things are headed (hint: back to the US in a big way!). We’ll also delve into three funds with European exposure (two of which are closed-end funds sporting double-digit dividends) that I urge you to hold off on now. The Financial Times was one of many outlets cheerleading a shift to Europe from America back in the spring. At the time, this sentiment was driven by tariffs, seemingly overextended US tech stocks and surging US markets. “There’s all sorts of reasons to like Europe, all sorts of reasons to hate the US,” contributor Katie Martin said in an April 25 FT podcast. The buy Europe trade was working well as recently as June, when the FT again reported that “European small-caps outshine US rivals as investors bet on growth revival.” Note the phrase growth revival here: The idea was that European stocks were overlooked and would gain attention when their earnings grew. Except that didn’t happen, with European firms posting disappointing earnings, as shown in the table below (more on this in a moment). Meanwhile in the US, companies saw 9% year-over-year earnings gains in Q2, meaning their average profit growth was much higher than the best sector in Europe (financials). And if you compare the best sector in the US—communication services (see chart below), which includes firms like Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META) and Netflix (NFLX)—to its cousins in Europe, the difference is staggering. As you can see at left above, the US sector’s 40.7% earnings growth is many times greater than the best European companies can produce. Meantime, Europe’s tech and telecom companies combined can’t even muster more than 1% average growth between them. Where does that leave the European markets? Well, they’re simply not reflecting this reality. With S&P 500 benchmark SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY)—in purple above—far behind the Vanguard European Stock Index Fund (VGK), in orange, as of this writing, it’s clear, based on our look at earnings, that European stocks are overbought. This makes VGK a fund to avoid. But ETFs aren’t our main focus at CEF Insider. So let’s turn to two CEFs that could face similar pressure. That, by the way, doesn’t mean these are bad funds—quite the contrary. But now is not the time to buy them, as they do have significant European holdings likely to weigh on them in the coming months. The first one is a good example of a fund I’ve liked in the past and will surely like again at some point: the abrdn Global Infrastructure Income Fund (ASGI). This fund yields a rich 11.8%, and its payout has been steady—it’s even moved up recently (though the dividend varies based on management’s assessment of the market and other factors). Moreover, the fund isn’t inherently European—in fact, it has 55% of its portfolio in US stocks, including cornerstone infrastructure players like Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC) and NextEra Energy (NEE). Still, it has 22% of its holdings in continental European stocks, plus another 2.6% in the UK. That’s enough to put a drag on the fund’s portfolio when European stocks snap back to reality. Plus there’s ASGI’s rich valuation. ASGI has been riding the enthusiasm about foreign assets, causing its discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio), which was averaging around 12% going into 2025, to evaporate. When European stocks correct, this fund will likely see a discount—and a consequent drop in its share price. Our second, and final, CEF to be wary of now is the PIMCO Income Strategy II Fund (PFN). This corporate-bond fund yields 11.5% and has held its payout steady since the pandemic days of 2021. However, as I write this, PFN trades at a 5.6% premium to NAV. And while it does have about 77% of its portfolio in the US, its largest allocations by country include European nations—France (3.2%), Spain (3%) and Germany (2.4%), to be precise—and Brazil (2.5%), which faces particularly steep tariffs from the US. To be sure, these are conservative allocations, but throw in PFN’s premium and you get a real risk of a pullback, in both the fund’s NAV and its market price, on any significant European selloff. And lower returns, especially in the fund’s NAV, could put pressure on PFN’s payout. The bottom line on all three of these funds? While geographic diversification is key for any portfolio, it’s only a matter of time until European stocks drop to reflect their meager earnings growth. Until European firms start booking bigger profits, we’re best to look elsewhere for growth. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

Title: SoundHound’s millionaire boss founded 3 software startups before even graduating—he tells Gen Z who want to be their own boss ‘throw darts randomly’
URL: https://fortune.com/2025/08/16/soundhound-ai-ceo-keyvan-mohajer-founder-stanford-dorm-room-entrepreneuer-gen-z-throw-darts-randomly-key-to-success/
Time Published: 2025-08-16T11:17:00Z

Preston Fore is a reporter at Fortune, covering education and personal finance for the Success team. As someone who immigrated from Iran at age 17 knowing little English, becoming a tech entrepreneur one day may have seemed like a far-fetched dream. But Keyvan Mohajer always kept the mindset: You cannot hit big unless you try. And try he did. By the time he walked across the stage at the University of Toronto to receive his bachelor’s degree in engineering, Mohajer already had three software companies to his name. Each later became profitable and helped seed the voice-AI project he began in his Stanford dorm room in 2004—which evolved into SoundHound AI. Today, the AI-voice communication company is worth more than $6.5 billion and has landed deals with clients including Nvidia, Snapchat, Mercedes-Benz, and more. For Mohajer, who serves as CEO, failure has only ever served as motivation. And, it’s a lesson Gen Z eager to launch side gigs can learn from: The willingness to go out on a limb and build a company from scratch may sound intimidating—but it only takes one good idea to explode into major success. “Every attempt, you should think of it as this is the one that’s going to succeed… Don’t just throw darts randomly at the target. For every attempt, you should use everything you’ve learned from past attempts and then there will be one that’s going to get the bullseye,” Mohajer tells Fortune. Mohajer grew up always fascinated by two things: movies and robots. So, after first seeing Star Trek, he always dreamed of how to bring computerized voice systems into the real world. But only after meeting his later cofounders, James Hom and Majid Emami, during his Stanford electrical engineering doctoral program did he realize he could be part of the team to make it a reality. Their first product was simple: query by humming. Two weeks prior to Christmas, the team didn’t leave their dorm room until they could build a product that could take their database of 20,000 media files and detect what song was being hummed. But by December 24, the code was cracked.“It was on Christmas Eve that I finally hummed this Godfather soundtrack, and it told me, ‘You’re singing The Godfather,’” he said to the Iranian Students of California’s The Tale of a Success series. His pitch to investors became simple: AI-powered voice is the future. “In 20 years we will talk to computers and they will talk back to us and that will change computing.” And while it took years for SoundHound to get up off the ground, he tells Fortune finding his passion, or what makes his “heart beat faster,” has been core to his success today. “You can do things and go through life and get by and check boxes and be average,” he says. “But I really wanted to be excellent, and I wanted to push boundaries. I want to go to places others haven’t gone before, and that gave me the drive to be an entrepreneur and just push the limits and combining the two.” While SoundHound’s market performance has had dramatic ebbs and flows, the stock price is up over 200% in the past year. This is thanks in part to a better-than-expected earnings report from earlier this month; the company’s revenue is up 217% year-over-year. Its market cap is over $6.5 billion. At a time when college students are questioning the value of a degree, SoundHound’s founding story is another reminder of the innovation that often spurs across college campuses—even if it is just from cofounders meeting for the first time. Companies such as Databricks, a $62 billion data software company, as well as Google, worth over $2.4 trillion, also planted roots in college. Both sets of founders met on Stanford’s campus. But there perhaps is no more famous company that spurred from the college experience than Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg met his cofounders, Eduardo Saverin, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes at Harvard University and built the foundation of the social platform now known as Meta (now worth nearly $2 trillion). The billionaire returned to his alma mater in 2017 and said he never expected to be such an entrepreneurial success story. “The thing is, it never even occurred to me that someone might be us,” Zuckerberg said. “We were just college kids. We didn’t know anything about that. There were all these big technology companies with resources. I just assumed one of them would do it.” “We’ve all started lifelong friendships here, and some of us even families,” he added. “That’s why I’m so grateful to this place. Thanks, Harvard.” Editor’s note, Aug. 16, 2025: This article has been updated to clarify a quote from CEO Keyvan Mohajer, who misspoke earlier. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Posted on August 15, 2025 by Nick Roach 6 Comments Today, we are releasing the first of two batches of WooCommerce modules for Divi 5. This first and more significant batch includes 17 of Divi’s 25 Woo modules, covering all the modules you need to build custom product and category pages. We’ll finish the remaining cart and checkout modules over the next couple of weeks and launch the Public Beta shortly after. Everyone is itching to get their hands on these modules, so we are releasing what’s ready. Check out the following video to see the new feature in action. 👇 If you have been using Divi 5 with WooCommerce, you’ll know that all of Divi’s Woo modules are already available for use in backward compatibility mode and can be found in the Woo folder when adding new modules to a page. With today’s update, you’ll find that most of these modules no longer have the legacy label and will no longer run in backward compatibility mode. The native Divi 5 versions of these modules are faster and easier to use. These modules include: That’s a lot of modules, and only a few remain! The Woo Product module can create lists of products and custom product category pages. To get even more creative, you can use Divi’s new Loop Builder to query WooCommerce products and build product loops of any type and style, breaking free from the Woo Product module’s static structure. Build your loop template, enabling looping, query the product post type, and plug dynamic product data into the loop. The rest of Divi’s Woo modules can create custom product pages. They provide every building block and can be fully customized using Divi’s wide range of design settings. You have complete creative freedom to break free of standard WooCommerce product templates. When it comes to increasing sales, there’s nothing more important than a stunning and compelling product page! Look at some beautiful product pages our design team created using these new modules. Woo product modules are available for Divi 5 today and are one of many features coming to Divi this year. You can follow along as we progress through the final release of Divi 5 and beyond, with updates every two weeks. Depending on your priorities, you can use Divi 5 now to build new websites or wait until we add more features, whatever works best for you. As outlined in Divi 5’s original multi-phase release schedule, the Divi 5 Public Alpha is like “Divi 5 Lite.” It’s missing a few features and may not be suitable for existing websites, but it’s ready to be used on new websites if you prefer the experience to Divi 4. We want you to try it, and if you love it, use it; when everyone loves it, we’ll make it official. In case you missed it, we recently released three new modules for Divi 5, including the much-requested Group Carousel module. This module allows you to create any type of carousel or slider, including post-based carousels, using Divi 5’s new loop builder. We also added a Lottie module for easy JSON-based animations and an Icon List module for easy list creation. Watch this video for all the details. 👇 2025 is the year of Divi 5. The tedious work is behind us. We built the super-fast foundation, and now it’s time for Divi to make its comeback. If you’re here for the Divi comeback, do us a huge favor and let us know by liking this video and leaving a comment. It means a lot to us to see you cheering Divi on, and it’s essential to feed the algorithm and spread the word.

No stone was... Where is the Short form description ? That always been a problem on my side. Is there something about the added details like color, size, etc… is there e render for that block ? The Woo Product Description module displays the short form description. The Woo Product Information module displays product attributes. These are available in Divi 4 and now in Divi 5. Will there be an add to cart button for the products module? Hey, Kay! There are no plans currently to include a Woo Products Module option for the “Add To Cart” button, but it’s an option easy to customize in. We have a guide on the topic: How to Customize the Woo Products Module to Include the “Add to Cart” Button. Hope this helps! 👍 In the video, I heard that the other Woo Modules will be released in the next couple of weeks. Is that still the case? Next question: If developers have been using the Legacy Modules in Divi 5, what happens to the those sites once the Legacy Modules no longer exist? Are these modules automatically updated to the new Divi 5 WC Modules? Will there be a working filter system for the shop page/category pages? That’s my current biggest gripe for building e-commerce on divi and the fact that other plugins don’t play well with template builder pages when filtering. So I have to use a non-divi theme when making a e-commerce store with many products that requires a good filtering system. Δ We offer a 30 Day Money Back Guarantee, so joining is Risk-Free!

Title: The Cowboys Sold For $140 Million in 1989—They're Now Worth $12.8 Billion. Here's How That 9,000% Return Compares to Market Giants

The Dallas Cowboys topped the NFL's most valuable teams list, according to Sportico: Jerry Jones bought the Cowboys in 1989 for $140 million, over $370 million in today's dollars. Based on the new valuation, his investment has grown 9,042% from the initial $90 million cash outlay and $50 million loan. Several companies with the largest market capitalizations on the market today hadn't even been started in 1989—Microsoft and Apple were the only members of the eventual Magnificent Seven that existed at the time. Tesla Inc. (TSLA), Meta Platforms Inc. (META), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Nvidia Corp. (NVDA), and Google, now under parent company Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL), had not yet been founded. Here's a look at how the Cowboys' 9,000% gain compares to the return some of the most important stocks today, like Microsoft and Apple, have delivered since February 1989, along with how some of the companies with the largest market caps at the time have performed since. When applicable, stock prices have been adjusted to account for stock splits that have taken place in the decades since. Jerry Jones turned a $140 million bet on the Dallas Cowboys in 1989 into a $12.8 billion empire—one of the most lucrative investments in sports history. His 9,000% return rivals the long-term gains of giants like Walmart and Berkshire Hathaway, but is still dwarfed by the explosive gains of tech titans such as Microsoft and Apple.

UPDATED 06:33 EDT / AUGUST 15 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 171 – GPT models are a two edged sword for automation platforms – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love.

In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade.

Title: 'Big Short' investor Michael Burry reveals fresh bets on Meta, Alibaba, and UnitedHealth
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/big-short-michael-burry-stock-portfolio-alibaba-meta-unitedhealth-buffett-2025-8
Time Published: 2025-08-15T01:45:27Z
Full Content:
Michael Burry bet big on stocks in the second quarter, swapping out bearish put options for bullish call options and adding several fresh holdings to his portfolio. The investor of "The Big Short" fame revealed in a quarterly filing on Thursday that he purchased calls on Alibaba, ASML, JD.com, Estee Lauder, Lululemon, Meta, Regeneron, UnitedHealth, and VF last quarter. Burry's Scion Asset Management also built direct stakes in Bruker, Lululemon, Regeneron, UnitedHealth, and MercadoLibre, while cutting his direct wager on Estee Lauder from 200,000 shares to 150,000. The UnitedHealth wager is notable as Warren Buffett, one of Burry's key influences, also invested in the health insurer last quarter via his Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate. Call options give investors the right to buy a certain number of a company's shares at a fixed price within a set period, allowing them to lock in a purchase price that may be lower than the market price. Similarly, investors can use put options to lock in a selling price, allowing them to profit from if the stock price declines. Scion is known for making big changes to its portfolio between quarters, but this was a particularly striking overhaul. At the end of March, it owned puts on Alibaba, Baidu, JD.com, Nvidia, PDD, and Trip.com worth a notional $186 million, plus a roughly $13 million stake in Estee Lauder. Three months later, it held calls on nine stocks worth a notional $522 million, and a further six direct stakes valued at $56 million. It's worth underscoring that Burry may have rejigged his stock bets in recent weeks, and his disclosures may not paint a full picture of his investment strategy. Quarterly portfolio updates known as 13Fs only provide a snapshot of a firm's holdings with a six-week lag and exclude shares sold short as well as investments in private companies, foreign-listed assets, and non-stock assets such as bonds and real estate. Burry shot to fame after predicting and profiting from the collapse of the mid-2000s US housing bubble — a wager that was immortalized in "The Big Short" book and movie adaptation. He's also known for making grave predictions of market crashes and recessions, investing in GameStop before it became a meme stock, and betting against popular assets such as Tesla, Apple, Nvidia, and the entire S&P 500 index.

Title: Capital Spending As The Key Market Driver?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/randywatts/2025/08/14/capital-spending-as-the-key-market-driver/
Time Published: 2025-08-14T23:20:29Z

ByRandy Watts ByRandy Watts, Contributor. In 2025, the U.S. economy has continued to chug along despite the headwinds of tariffs and trade dislocations, as well as the current war in Ukraine and the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. One of the sources of this economic strength has been capital spending by U.S. companies. The main driver has been the buildout of artificial intelligence (AI) capacity, especially by the mega-cap technology companies Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft. Figure 1: Total U.S. Capital Expenditures, 1950–2025 Historically, consumer spending accounts for roughly two-thirds of the U.S. economy. Shockingly, according to a post by Neil Dutta, head of economic research at Renaissance Macro Research, AI spending exceeded consumer expenditures in the last two quarters, as shown in the graphic below. “So far this year, AI capital expenditures (capex), which we define as information processing equipment plus software, have added more to GDP growth than consumer spending,” Dutta said. Figure 2: U.S. AI Capital Expenditures versus Personal Consumption (PCE), 2022–2025 Christopher Mims of The Wall Street Journal calculates that U.S. AI spending exceeded $100 billion in the previous quarter alone. "The AI infrastructure buildout is so gigantic that in the past six months, it contributed more to the growth of the U.S. economy than all of consumer spending. The Magnificent Seven spent more than $100 billion on data centers and related infrastructure in the past three months alone,” Mims wrote. Figure 3: Capital Expenditures of META, GOOGL, MSFT, AMZN, 2018–2025 As we discussed in October 2024, there are many sub-groups related to this spending, including the following O’Neil Industry Groups. Table 1: AI/Data Center-Related O’Neil Industry Groups A potential accelerant to overall capital spending comes from accelerated depreciation changes included in the recently passed Big Beautiful Bill. This law allows companies to deduct 100% of the depreciation of any qualified project or property in the first year it goes into service. This reduces a business’ taxes and helps improve near-term cash flow by reducing taxable income. This deduction covers most machinery, industrial equipment, computers, servers, and software, as well as some furniture, fixtures, and building components. As a result, we expect capital spending to rise over the next 12 months in AI and beyond. Thematic areas that may benefit include Power/Electrification, Aerospace, Industrial Manufacturing, Transportation, Telecommunications, and Life Science/Pharma. Across U.S.-based stocks with a market cap above $500M and at least $50M in annual sales, we analyzed ratios to identify potential beneficiaries. Then, we broke them down by O’Neil Major Industry (89 Groups, combines some of the 197 O’Neil Industry Groups together). 1) Percent of D&A versus sales (most recent annual period): used to find the most capital-intensive businesses, normalized for company size. Across all companies, the median percentage is 4.5%. Here are the major industries with the highest and lowest ratios. Table 2: Percent of D&A versus Sales of O’Neil Major Industries 2) Percentage of D&A versus total assets (most recent annual period): used to gauge how quickly businesses utilize their capital base, normalized for capital base size. Across all companies, the median percentage is 3.0%. Here are the major industries with the highest and lowest ratios. Table 3: Percent of D&A versus Assets of Major O’Neil Industries Major industries that appear on the left side in both of the above tables include Oil and Gas–Exploration/Production, Telecommunication Services, Metal Product and Fabrication, Oil and Gas–Integrated, Chemical, Shipping, Pollution Control, Semiconductors, Cement Aggregates, Agricultural Operation, Leisure Services, Trucking, and Paper and Forest Products. A handful of Health Care segments appear in the D&A versus sales table, while several Retail groups appear in the D&A versus assets table. Of the groups with higher ratios in each table (33 unique), the groups below are leading and/or reasonably well set-up from a technical perspective. Figure 4: Weekly Mini Charts of Key O’Neil Major Industries Despite the potential accelerated depreciation catalyst, tariff headwinds remain. In particular, non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft—which track new orders placed with U.S. manufacturers for durable capital goods designed to last more than three years—have seen mixed momentum. While orders are up from 2024 levels (Figure 5), they have recently pulled back (Figure 6) as businesses put off capital investments despite the tax advantages granted by the Big Beautiful Bill. Figure 5/6: U.S. Manufacturing Orders and Order Growth, 2022–2025 Overall, much like the Trump corporate tax cuts in his first term, we believe the benefits from the change in depreciation expensing are being underemphasized by the market. While capital goods orders have been weak recently, we think they will rise from current levels as the new law takes effect and tariff uncertainty eases. The above industry lists and charts provide fertile ground for investors interested in this theme. We expect select beneficiaries of the new law to deliver notable stock price outperformance over the next 12 months, and we encourage readers to incorporate this view into their current investment strategy.

Ark Invest added 2,532,693 shares of BLSH in total across three of its actively managed ETF funds—ARKK, ARKW, and ARKF—as shares hit the market at the conclusion of the Bullish IPO. Here's every move Cathie Wood and Ark Invest made in the stock market today 8/13 pic.twitter.com/UStxQzSn36 — Ark Invest Daily (@ArkkDaily) August 14, 2025 Bullish, which operates a cryptocurrency exchange and owns crypto media publication CoinDesk, offered shares in its firm for $37 as part of its IPO yesterday. But the stock quickly rose after trading began, reaching as high as $118 in the first afternoon of trading. The feat mirrors the explosive debut of USDC stablecoin issuer Circle, which completed its IPO in June and quickly gained nearly 4x when it hit the market—outpacing IPOs from noted tech firms like Meta and Airbnb when they made their debuts. Ark Invest maintains exposure to Circle too, holding more than 4.2 million shares of CRCL across its ETFs, now valued at more than $626 million. It maintains exposure to crypto in other ways too, with combined holdings of more than $1.5 billion in shares of crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) and brokerage Robinhood (HOOD), both of which fall inside its top 10 holdings overall. It also holds around $17 million worth of shares in crypto exchange eToro (ETOR). Ark also has its own Bitcoin ETF, ARKB, which added $36.6 million in funds on Wednesday and holds more than $2 billion in assets according to data from Farside Investors. The success of Bullish’s IPO adds fuel to the accelerating trend of crypto firms seeking entwinement with public markets. Other exchanges like Gemini and OKX have signaled their interest in IPOs, with the former confidentially filing its intentions in June. Others, like FalconX and Kraken, are rumored to be in the mix as well. Shares of BLSH are up once more on Thursday, jumping nearly 10% to $74.60, bringing ARK’s holdings to nearly $189 million.

Title: Ethereum Could Surge To $15K As Institutions Pile In, Research Shows

According to Fundstrat research, Ether could climb much higher before the end of 2025, with price targets ranging from $10,000 to as high as $15,000. Reports show Ether jumped about 60% over the past 30 days and hit a four-year high near $4,770 in early trading, while other coverage put the token at $4,694 and noted a 78% surge over an eight-week stretch. Those moves have pushed Ether close to its all-time peak, and fund managers are taking notice. According to Fundstrat’s chief information officer Tom Lee and head of digital asset research Sean Farrell, institutional forces and new rules are key drivers. They point to stablecoin work and tokenized projects being built mostly on Ethereum, and they cite regulatory efforts such as the GENIUS Act and the SEC’s so-called Project Crypto as factors that could speed Wall Street’s move onto blockchain rails. Based on data, Ethereum holds a commanding 55% share of the $25 billion real-world asset tokenization sector, a stat that Fundstrat uses to argue for broader institutional adoption. Reports have disclosed large-scale corporate accumulation that several analysts say is taking supply off the market. BitMine Immersion Technologies has reportedly added about 1.2 million ETH since early July, leaving the company with roughly $5.5 billion worth of Ether on its books. Company stock (BMNR) has been volatile, with some coverage pointing to a 1,300% jump over a short period. Fundstrat and other observers say those kinds of corporate treasuries, combined with fresh ETF flows, could create a structural bid for ETH if the buying is sustained. Rachael Lucas, a crypto analyst at BTC Markets, described these positions as strategic and long-term, saying they remove “substantial liquidity” from trading pools. According to Fundstrat, Ether is outperforming Bitcoin this year. One set of figures put ETH’s year-to-date gain at 28% against Bitcoin’s 18%, while other reports more recently showed ETH up 41% YTD and Bitcoin up 30% YTD, with BTC trading near $121,000 in that snapshot. Based on reports, Fundstrat’s analysts view ETH as a major macro trade for the next 10 to 15 years if institutional and regulatory trends continue to push demand higher. Analysts caution that lofty targets will need sustained, large inflows to become reality. Watch for the pace and consistency of ETF flows, corporate treasury disclosures, and any regulatory moves around stablecoins and custody rules. There’s also a practical concern: big, concentrated buys can tighten markets quickly but may also reverse if sentiment shifts or liquidity needs change. According to analysis and public comments from Fundstrat, the bullish case for Ether is clear and backed by specific numbers: $10,000 to $15,000 targets, corporate treasuries holding millions of ETH, and rapid recent gains.

But for Christian, that's not just a metaphor, it's a lifestyle. By day, he navigates the ever-shifting tides of the cryptocurrency market, wielding words like a seasoned editor and crafting articles that decipher the jargon for the masses. When the PC goes on hibernate mode, however, his pursuits take a more mechanical (and sometimes philosophical) turn. Christian's journey with the written word began long before the age of Bitcoin. In the hallowed halls of academia, he honed his craft as a feature writer for his college paper. This early love for storytelling paved the way for a successful stint as an editor at a data engineering firm, where his first-month essay win funded a months-long supply of doggie and kitty treats – a testament to his dedication to his furry companions (more on that later). Christian then roamed the world of journalism, working at newspapers in Canada and even South Korea. He finally settled down at a local news giant in his hometown in the Philippines for a decade, becoming a total news junkie. But then, something new caught his eye: cryptocurrency. It was like a treasure hunt mixed with storytelling - right up his alley! So, he landed a killer gig at NewsBTC, where he's one of the go-to guys for all things crypto. He breaks down this confusing stuff into bite-sized pieces, making it easy for anyone to understand (he salutes his management team for teaching him this skill). Think Christian's all work and no play? Not a chance! When he's not at his computer, you'll find him indulging his passion for motorbikes. A true gearhead, Christian loves tinkering with his bike and savoring the joy of the open road on his 320-cc Yamaha R3. Once a speed demon who hit 120mph (a feat he vowed never to repeat), he now prefers leisurely rides along the coast, enjoying the wind in his thinning hair. Speaking of chill, Christian's got a crew of furry friends waiting for him at home. Two cats and a dog. He swears cats are way smarter than dogs (sorry, Grizzly), but he adores them all anyway. Apparently, watching his pets just chillin’ helps him analyze and write meticulously formatted articles even better. Here's the thing about this guy: He works a lot, but he keeps himself fueled by enough coffee to make it through the day - and some seriously delicious (Filipino) food. He says a delectable meal is the secret ingredient to a killer article. And after a long day of crypto crusading, he unwinds with some rum (mixed with milk) while watching slapstick movies. Looking ahead, Christian sees a bright future with NewsBTC. He says he sees himself privileged to be part of an awesome organization, sharing his expertise and passion with a community he values, and fellow editors - and bosses - he deeply respects. So, the next time you tread into the world of cryptocurrency, remember the man behind the words – the crypto crusader, the grease monkey, and the feline philosopher, all rolled into one.

Title: Adtech Stocks Tumble as AI, Increased Competition Weigh on Revenue

A turbulent Q2 earnings season has divided the adtech sector, as investors sell off shares of The Trade Desk, PubMatic, and Viant. Compared to the NASDAQ Composite, indicative of the broader market’s health, adtech stocks are trending down. Few firms, including AppLovin and Criteo, have been able to weather the selloff. Experts say the latest figures underscore the challenges facing adtech companies today; chief among them is competition with Big Tech titans who are increasingly entering their territory. The sector is now “operating in a market dominated by Google, Meta, and Amazon—three vertically integrated giants that collectively control the lion’s share of digital ad spend,” said Jason Kint, CEO of Digital Content Next. “They not only run the largest ad networks but also own the platforms, data, and exchanges, allowing them to extract value from every part of the digital supply chain—often at the expense of publishers, advertisers and adtech companies.” Add in the complexities of navigating the AI boom—which is causing upheaval in how people search and stifling publisher traffic—and adtech companies are finding themselves in a new kind of pressure cooker. Demand-side platform The Trade Desk basked in Wall Street’s good graces throughout 2024 and into early 2025, as its share price soared and Q1 revenues achieved 26% year-over-year growth. But the tides have quickly turned: The stock plunged nearly 40% late last week on the back of the company’s Q2 earnings report, which showed slowing revenue growth and heightened competition from Big Tech firms like Amazon. CEO Jeff Green insisted on a call with investors that “Amazon is not a competitor.” Financial analysts expect a declining growth rate for The Trade Desk throughout the second half of the year. PubMatic, a leading sell-side platform, cited changes by a top demand-side partner in July for revenue hiccups. Its stock is down about 20% since earnings were reported Monday, and more than 30% over the last two weeks. The company’s CEO Rajeev Goel said on a call with investors that “a top DSP buyer shifted a significant number of clients to a new platform that evaluates inventory differently, impacting our revenue.” He added that PubMatic plans to “diversify ad spend away from legacy DSPs.” MNTN, the CTV darling that shot to prominence with the help of Ryan Reynolds and his creative agency Maximum Effort, saw shares tumble after reporting its first-ever earnings on the back of a May IPO. Only a few major firms have been able to weather the adtech selloff. Chief among them is AppLovin, which helps developers monetize mobile apps with ads. In June, AppLovin sold off its mobile apps business, which spurred increased investor confidence and netted it.$400 million in cash. The stock saw double-digit growth last week after it reported Q2 earnings that showed a 77% jump in revenue year-over-year, to $1.26 billion. AppLovin surpassed The Trade Desk last year to become the largest adtech company by market cap. Zeta Global, which positions itself as an AI-powered marketing cloud platform, has seen increased investor interest over the last two weeks. Criteo, a commerce-focused DSP, is also holding its own, even as rivals pose a growing threat. Meanwhile, the two leading ad verification vendors, Integral Ad Science (IAS) and DoubleVerify, were split. IAS’s stock spiked after an August 7 earnings report that included better-than-expected publisher performance, plus an adjusted EBITDA of $109.84 million. DoubleVerify, however, fared poorer. The firm beat revenue estimates, but missed on earnings per share. The adtech sector is entering the back half of 2025 with investor sentiment sharply divided, compounded by anxieties over AI and macroeconomic uncertainty in response to the Trump administration’s tariffs and steady inflation. Some analysts are confident about the industry as a whole, but see this selloff as a sign of splintering and increased competition. “Adtech companies are in a surprisingly solid place, by which I mean most businesses are running well enough with low double-digit growth on average, and mostly with growing profitability,” said Brian Wieser, principal and CEO of Madison and Wall. “If there’s a problem, it’s that there is no consolidator, and so the business seems likely to remain a fragmented, almost cottage industry, with a large number of mid-sized companies but few giants.” Kendra Barnett is Adweek's senior tech reporter.

Title: AI Is A Money Trap
URL: https://www.wheresyoured.at/ai-is-a-money-trap/
Time Published: 2025-08-14T05:47:02Z
Full Content:
In the last week, we’ve had no less than three different pieces asking whether the massive proliferation of data centers is a massive bubble, and though they, at times, seem to take the default position of AI’s inevitable value, they’ve begun to sour on the idea that it’s going to happen soon. Meanwhile, quirked-up threehundricorn OpenAI has either raised or is about to raise another $8.3 billion in cash, less than two months since it raised $10 billion from SoftBank and a selection of venture capital firms. I hate to be too crude, but where the fuck is this money going? Is OpenAI just incinerating capital? Is it compute? Is it salaries? Is it compute? Is it to build data centers, because SoftBank isn’t actually building anything for Stargate? The Information suggested OpenAI is using the money to build data centers — possibly the only worse investment it can make other than generative AI, and it’s one that it can’t avoid because OpenAI also is somehow running out of compute. And now they're in "early-stage discussions" about an employee share sale that would value the company at $500 billion, a ludicrous number that shows we're leaving the realm of reality. To give you some context, Shopify's market cap is $197 billion, Salesforce's is $248 billion, and Netflix's is $499 billion. Do you really think that OpenAI is worth more than these companies? Do you think they're worth more than AMD at a $264 billion market cap? Do you? AHhhhhhhh- Amongst this already-ridiculous situation sits the issue of OpenAI and Anthropic’s actual revenues, which I wrote about last week, and have roughly estimated to be $5.26 billion and $1.5 billion respectively (as of July). In any case, these estimates were made based on both companies’ predilection for leaking their “annualized revenues,” or monthx12. This extremely annoying term is one that I keep bringing up because it’s become the de-facto way for generative AI companies to express their revenue, and both OpenAI and Anthropic are leaking them intentionally, and doing so in a way that suggests they’re not using even the traditional ways of calculating them. OpenAI leaked on July 30 2025 that it was at $12 billion annualized revenue — so around $833 million in a 30-day period — yet two days later on August 1 2025 the New York Times reported they were at $13 billion annualized revenue, or $1.08 billion of monthly revenue. It’s very clear OpenAI is not talking in actual calendar months, at which point we can assume something like a trailing 30 day window (as in the “month” is just 30 days rather than a calendar month). We can, however, declaratively say that it’s not doing “the month of June” or “the month of July” because if it was, OpenAI wouldn’t have given two vastly different god damn numbers in the same two day period. That doesn’t make any sense. There are standard ways to handle annualized revenue, and it's clear they're not following them. And to be even clearer, while I can’t say for certain, I believe these leaks are deliberate. OpenAI’s timing matches exactly with fundraising. On Anthropic’s side, these revenues are beginning to get really weird. Anthropic went from making $72 million ($875 million annualized) in January to $433 million in July — or at least, it leaked on July 1, 2025 that it was at $4 billion annualized to The Information ($333 million a month) and claimed it had reached $5 billion annualized revenue ($416 million) to Bloomberg on July 29 2025 . How’d it get there? I’m guessing it was from cranking up prices on Cursor, and we’ve had the confirmation that’s the case thanks to The Information reporting that $1.4 billion of its annualized revenue is from its top two customers (so around $116 million a month), the biggest of which is Cursor. Confusingly, The Information also says that Anthropic’s Claude Code is “generating nearly $400 million in annualized revenue, roughly doubling from just a few weeks ago,” meaning about $33 million of monthly revenue. In any case, I think Cursor is a huge indicator of the current fragility of the bubble — and the fact that for most AI startups, there’s simply no way out, because being acquired or going public does not appear to be a viable route. I know it sounds a little insane, but I believe that Cursor is the weak point of the entire AI bubble, and I’ll explain why, and how this could go. This is, by no means, inevitable, but I cannot work out what Cursor does other than this. Cursor, at this point, faces two options: die, or get acquired. This is not an attack on anyone who works at the company, nor anything personal. The unit economics of this business do not make sense and yet, on some level, its existence is deeply important to the valley’s future. OpenAI? OpenAI couldn’t acquire Windsurf because it was too worried Microsoft would get the somehow-essential IP of one of what feels like a hundred different AI-powered coding environments. It also already tried and failed to buy Cursor, and if I’m honest, I bet Cursor would sell now. Honestly, Cursor fucked up bad not selling then. It could have got $10 billion and Sam Altman would’ve had to accelerate the funding clause. It would’ve been so god-damn sick, but now the only “sick” thing here is Cursor’s fragile, plagued business model. How about Anthropic? Eh! It already has their own extremely-expensive coding environment, Claude Code, which I estimated loses the company 100% to 10,000% of a subscription per-customer a few weeks ago, and now Anthropic is adding weekly limits on accounts, which will, I believe, create some of the most gnarly churn in SaaS history. Also, does Anthropic really want to acquire its largest customer? Also, with what money? It’s not raising $5 billion to bail out Cursor. Anthropic needs that to feed directly into Andy Jassy’s pocket to keep offering increasingly-more-complex models that never quite seem to be good enough. Google? It just sort-of-bought Windsurf! It can’t do that again. It’s already given out the participation trophy multiple billions of dollars to investors and founders so nobody has to get embarrassed about this, and then allowed Cognition to pick up the scraps of a business that made $6.83 million a month after burning $143 million of investor capital (TechCrunch reports Windsurf was left with $100 million in cash post-acquisition). TechCrunch also reports that Cognition paid $250 million for what remained, and that this deal didn’t actually pay out the majority of Windsurf’s employees, Meta? If I’m Cursor’s CEO, I am calling Mark Zuckerberg and pretending that I think the only person in the world who can usher in the era of Superintelligence is the guy who burned more than $45 billion on the metaverse and believes that not wearing AI glasses in the future will be a disadvantage. I would be saying all manner of shit about the future, and that the only way to do this was to buy my AI-powered coding startup that literally can’t afford to exist. And that really is the problem. These companies are all going through the same motions that every company before them did — raise as much money as possible, get as big as possible, and eventually scale to the point you’re fat with enterprise cash. Except the real problem is that, just like big tech’s new gluttony of physical real estate it's taken on, generative AI companies are burdened with a constant and aggressive form of cloud debt — the endless punishment of the costs of accessing the API for generative AI models that always seem to get a little better, but never in such a way that anything really changes other than how much Anthropic and OpenAI are going to need at the end of the month or they break your startup’s legs. I’m not even trying to be funny! Anthropic raised its prices on Cursor so severely it broke its already-unprofitable business model. These products — while also, for the most part, not producing that much revenue — need to be sold with users being aware of (and sensitive to) the cost of providing them, and Cursor’s original product was $20-a-month for 500 “fast requests” of different models, in the same way that accessing Claude Code on any subscription is either $20, $100, or $200 a month rather than paying per API call, because these companies all sell products that shield the customer from the actual costs of running the services. The irony is that, despite being willing to kill these companies by fundamentally changing the terms upon which they access these models, Anthropic is also, in some way, dependent on Cursor, Replit, and other similar firms continuing to buy tokens at the same rate as before, as that consumption is baked into its ARR figures, as well as the forward-looking revenue projections. It is, in some sense, a Kobayashi Maru. Anthropic has an existential need to screw over its customers by hiking rates and imposing long-term commitments, but its existence is also, in some way, predicated on these companies continuing to exist. If Cursor and Replit both die, that’s a significant chunk of Anthropic's API business gone in a flash — and, may I remind you, that significantly overshadows its subscription business (making it almost like an inverse of OpenAI, where subscriptions drive the bulk of revenue). Anthropic’s future is wedded to Cursor, and I just don’t see how Cursor survives, let alone exits, or gets subsumed by another company in a way that mirrors how acquisitions have worked since…ever. If Cursor does not sell for a healthy amount — I’m talking $10 billion plus, and I mean actually sell, not “the founders are hired in a strange contractual agreement that pays out investors and its assets are sold to Rick from Pawn Stars” — it will prove that no generative AI company, to this date, has actually been successful. In reality, I expect a Chumlee-esque deal that helps CEO Michael Truell buy a porsche while his staff makes nothing. Is Cursor worth $10 billion? Nope! No matter how good its product may or may not be, it is not good enough to be sold at a price that doesn’t require Cursor to incinerate hundreds of millions of dollars with no end in sight. And this ultimately gives us the real conundrum — why aren’t generative AI startups selling? Before we go any further, there have been some acquisitions, but they are sparse, and seem almost entirely centered around bizarre acqui-hires and confusing fire sales. AMD bought Silo AI, “the largest private AI lab in Europe,” in August 2024 for $665 million, which appears to be the only real acquisition in generative AI history, and appears to be partially based on Silo’s use of AMD’s GPUs. Elsewhere, NVIDIA bought OctoAI for an estimated $250 million in September 2024, after buying Brev.dev in July 2024 for an undisclosed sum, and then Gretel in March 2025. Yet in all three cases these are products to deploy generative AI, and not products built on top of generative AI or AI models. Canva bought “generative AI content and research company” Leonardo.AI in July 2024 for an undisclosed sum. Really, the only significant one I’ve seen was on July 29 2025 — publicly-traded customer service platform NICE buying AI-powered customer service company Cognigy in a $955 million deal. According to Cxtoday, Cognigy expects about $85 million in revenue this year, though nobody appears to be talking about costs. However, Cognigy, according to some sources, charges tens or hundreds of thousands per contract for its “AI voice agents” that can “understand and respond to user input in a natural way.” Great! We’ve got one real-deal “company built on models” acquisition, and it’s a company that most people haven’t heard of making around $7 million a month. Let’s take a look at the others. Outside of one very industry-specific acquisition, there just doesn’t seem to be the investor hunger to buy a company valued at $9.9 billion. And you have to ask why. If AI is, as promised, the thing that’ll radically change our economy, and these companies are building the tools that’ll bring about that change, why does nobody want to buy them? And, in the broader term, what does it mean when these companies — those with $10bn, or in the case of OpenAI, $300bn valuations — can’t be bought, and can’t go public? Where does this go? What happens next? What’s the gameplan here? How will the venture firms that ploughed billions of capital into these businesses bring a return for their LPs if there are no IPOs or buyouts? The economic implications of these questions are, quite frankly, terrifying — especially when you consider the importance that VC has historically held in building the US tech ecosystem, and they raise further questions about the impact of an AI bubble on companies that are promising, and do have a viable business model, and a product with actual fit, but won’t be able to actually raise any cash. Great! I would believe it was possible if it had ever, ever happened, which it has not. I’m not even being sarcastic or rude. It has just not happened. No company that actually stakes their entire product on generative AI appears to be able to make money. Glean, a company that makes at best $8.3 million a month ($100 million annualized revenue) said it had $550 million in cash December of last year, and then had to raise $150 million in June of this year. Where did that money go? Why does a generative search engine product with revenues that are less than a third of the Cincinnati Reds baseball team need half a billion dollars to make $8.3 million a month? I’m not saying these companies are unnecessary, so much as they may very well be impossible to run as real businesses. This isn’t even a qualitative judgment of any one generative AI company. I’m just saying, if any of these were good businesses, they would be either profitable or being acquired in actual deals, and there would be good businesses by now. The amount of cash they are burning does not suggest they’re rapidly approaching any kind of sane burn rate, or we would have heard. Putting aside any kind of skepticism I have, anything you may hold against me for what I say or the way I say it, where are the profitable companies? Why isn’t there one, outside of the companies creating data to train the AI models, or Nvidia? We’re three years in, and we haven’t had one. We also have had no exits and no IPOs. There has been no cause for celebration, no validation of a business model through another company deciding that it was necessary to continue its dominance by raising funds on the public market, or allowing actual investors — flawed though they may be — act as the determiner of their value. It is unclear what the addition of Windsurf’s intellectual property adds to Cognition, much like it’s a little unclear what differentiates Cognition’s so-called AI-powered software engineer “Devin” from anything else on the market. I hear Goldman is paying for it, and said the stupidest shit I’ve ever heard to CNBC that nevertheless shows how little it’s actually paying for: “We’re going to start augmenting our workforce with Devin, which is going to be like our new employee who’s going to start doing stuff on the behalf of our developers,” Argenti told CNBC. “Initially, we will have hundreds of Devins [and] that might go into the thousands, depending on the use cases.” Hundreds of Devins = hundreds of seats. At a very optimistic 500 users at the highest-end pricing of $500-a-month (if it’s $20-a-month, Cognition is making a whole, at most, less than $20,000 a month) — and let’s assume that it does a discount at enterprise scale, because that always happens — that’s $250,000 a month! Wow! $3 million in revenue? On a trial basis? Amazing! In fact, I can’t find a shred of evidence that Cognition otherwise makes much money. Despite currently raising $300 million at a $10 billion valuation, I can find no information about Cognition’s revenues beyond one comment from The Information from July 2024, when Cognition raised at a $2 billion valuation: Cognition’s fundraise is the latest example of AI startups raising capital at sky-high valuations despite having little or no revenue.” In a further move per The Information that is both a pale horse and a deeply scummy thing to do, Cognition has now laid off 30 people from the Windsurf team, and is now offering the remaining 200 buyouts equal to 9 months of salary and, I assume, the end of any chance to accrue further stock in Cognition. CEO Scott Wu said the following in the email telling Windsurf employees about the layoffs and buyouts: “We don’t believe in work-life balance—building the future of software engineering is a mission we all care so deeply about that we couldn’t possibly separate the two,” he said. “We know that not everyone who joined Windsurf had signed up to join Cognition where we spend 6 days at the office and clock 80+ hour weeks.” All that piss, vinegar, and burning of the midnight oil does not appear to have created a product that actually matters. I realize this is a little cold, but if you’re braying and smacking your chest about your hard-charging, 6-days-a-week office culture, you should be able to do better than “we have one publicly-known customer and nobody knows our revenue.” Maybe it’s a little simpler: Cognition paid $250 million to acquire Windsurf so that it could, after the transaction, say they have $82 million in annualized revenue. If that’s the case, this is one of the dodgiest, weirdest acquisitions I’ve seen in my life — two founders getting a few hundred million dollars between them and their investors, and a few of their colleagues moving with them to Google, leaving the rest of the staff effectively jobless or in Hell with little payoff for their time working at Windsurf. I can only imagine how it must have felt to go from being supposedly acquired by OpenAI to this farcical “rich get richer” bullshit. It also suggests that the actual underlying value of Windsurf’s IP was $250 million. So, I ask, why, exactly, is Cognition worth $10 billion? And why did it have to raise $300 million after raising “hundreds of millions” according to Bloomberg in March? Where is the money going? It doesn’t seem to have great revenue, Carl Brown of the Internet of Bugs revealed it faked the demo of “Devin the AI powered software developer” last year, and Devin doesn’t even rank on SWE-benchmark, the industry standard for model efficacy at coding tasks. At best, it’s now acquired their own unprofitable coding environment and the smidgen of revenue associated. How would Cognition go public? What is the actual exit path for Cognition, or any other generative AI startup? And that, right there, is Silicon Valley’s own housing crisis, except instead of condos houses they can’t afford with sub-prime adjustable rate mortgages, venture capitalists have invested in unprofitable, low-revenue startups with valuations that they can never sell at. And, like homeowners in the dismal years of 2008 and 2009, they’re almost certainly underwater — they just haven’t realized it yet. Where consumers were unable to refinance their mortgages to bring their monthly payments down, generative AI startups face pressure to continually raise at higher and higher valuations to keep up with their costs, with each one making it less likely their company will survive. The other difference is that, in the case of the housing crisis, those who were able to hold onto their properties eventually saw their equity recover to their pre-crash levels, in part because housing is essential and because its price is influenced just as much by supply and demand, as it is the ability for people to finance the purchase of properties, and when the population increases, so too does the demand for housing. None of that is true with AI. There’s a finite number of investors, a finite number of companies, and a finite amount of capital — and those companies are only as valuable as the expectations that investors have for them, and as the broader sentiment towards AI. Who is going to buy Cognition? Because the only other opportunity for the investors who put the money into this company to make money here — let alone to recoup their initial investment — is for Cognition to go public. Do you think Cognition will go public? How about Cursor? It’s worth $9.9 billion, and there was a rumour that it was raising at a valuation of $18 billion to $20 billion back in June. Do you see Perplexity, at a valuation of $18 billion, selling to another company? The alternative, as discussed, is that Perplexity, a company with 15 million users and, at $150 million annualized revenue, is still making less than half of the revenue of the Cincinnati Reds baseball team ($325 million in annual revenue, and that’s real money, not “annualized revenue”), must go public. Perplexity has, at this point, raised over a billion dollars to lose $68 million in 2024 on $34 million of revenue. By comparison, the Cincinnati Reds is a great business, with a net monthly income of $29 million, all to provide a service that upsets and humiliates millions of people from Ohio every year for the pleasure of America. Putting aside the Reds, what exactly is it that Perplexity could offer to the public markets as a stock, or to an acquirer? Apple considered acquiring it in June, but Apple tends to acquire the companies it wants to integrate into the core business (as was the case with Siri), which makes me think that Perplexity leaked information about a deal that was never really serious. Hell, Meta talked about acquiring it too. Isn’t it weird that two different companies talked about buying Perplexity but neither of them did it? CEO Aravind Srivinas said in July that he wanted to “remain independent,” which is a weird thing to say after talking to two giant multi-trillion-dollar market cap tech firms about selling to them. It’s almost as if nobody actually wants to buy Perplexity, or any of these sham companies, which I know sounds mean, but if you are worth billions or tens of billions of dollars and you can’t make more than a bottom-tier baseball team in fucking Ohio, you are neither innovative nor deserving of said valuation. But really, my pissiness and baseball comparisons aside, what exactly is the plan for these companies? They don’t make enough money to survive without a continuous flow of venture capital, and they don’t seem to make impressive sums of money even when allowed to burn as much as they’d like. These companies are not being forced to live frugally, or at least have yet to be made to, perhaps because they’re all actively engaged at spending as much money as possible in pursuit of finding an idea that makes more money than it loses. This is not a rational or reasonable way to proceed. Yes, there are startups that can justify burning capital. Yes, there are companies that have burned hundreds of millions of dollars to find their business models, or billions in the case of Uber, but none of these companies are like those companies in the generative AI space. GenAI businesses don’t have the same economics, nor do they have the same total addressable markets. If you’re going to say “Amazon Web Services,” I already explained why you’re wrong a few weeks ago. These startups are their VC firms’ subprime mortgages, overstuffed valuations with no exit route, and no clear example of how to sell them or who to sell them to. The closest they’ve got is using generative AI startups as beauty pageants for guys wearing Patagonia, finding ways to pretend that the guy who runs an AI startup — sorry, AI lab — is some sort of mysterious genius versus just another founder in just another bubble with just another overstuffed valuation. The literal only liquidity mechanism (outside of Cognigy) that generative AI has had so far is “selling AI talent to big tech at a premium.” Nobody has gone or is going public, and if they are not going public, the only route for these companies is to either become profitable — which they haven’t — or sell to somebody, which they do not. But I’ve been dancing around the real reason they won’t sell: because, fundamentally, generative AI does not let companies build something new. Anyone that builds a generative AI product is ultimately just prompting the model, albeit in increasingly more-complex ways at the scale of something like Claude Code — though Anthropic has the advantage of being one of the main veins of infrastructure. This means that a generative AI company owns very few unique things beyond their talent, and will forever be at the mercy of any and all decisions that their model provider makes, such as increasing prices or creating competing products. I know it sounds ludicrous, but this is the reality of these companies. While there are some companies that have some unique training and models, none of them seem to be building interesting or unique products as a result. If your argument is that these things take some time — how long do they have? No, really! So many of you have said that “this is what happens, they burn a bunch of money, they grow, and then…” and then you stop short because the next thing you say is “turn profitable by getting enterprise customers.” Nobody can do the first part and few can do the second part in anything approaching a consistent fashion. But really, how long should we give them? Three years? Perplexity’s had three years and a billion dollars, it doesn’t seem to be close to profitable. How long does Perplexity deserve, exactly? An eternity? Every single example of a company that has “burned a lot of money and then not done so in the end” has been a company with a physical thing or connections to the real world, with the exception of Facebook, which was never the kind of cash-burning monstrosity that generative AI is. There has never been a software company that has just chewed through hundreds of millions — or billions — of dollars and then suddenly became profitable, mostly because the magical valuations of software have been in their ability to transcend infrastructure. One’s unit economics in the sales of software like Microsoft Office or providing access to Instagram do not require the most powerful graphics processing units run at full tilt at all times, and those are products that people like and want to use every day. I get people saying “they’re in the growth stage!” about a few companies, but when all of them are unprofitable, and even the unprofitable ones outside of OpenAI and Anthropic aren’t really making impressive amounts of money anyway? C’mon! This isn’t anything like any boom that leads to something, and it’s because the economics do not make sense. And that’s before we get to OpenAI and Anthropic! So, as a reminder, OpenAI appears to have burned at least ten billion dollars in the last two months. It is has just raised another $8.3 billion dollars (after raising $10 billion in June according to the New York Times), and intends to receive around $22.5 billion by the end of year from SoftBank, and that is assuming it becomes a for-profit entity by the end of the year, and if that doesn’t happen, the round gets cut to $20 billion total, meaning that SoftBank would only be on the hook for a further $1.7 billion. I am repeating myself, but I need you to really get this: OpenAI just got $10 billion in June 2025, and had to raise another $8.3 billion in August 2025. That is an unbelievable cash burn, one dwarfing any startup in history, rivalled only by xAI, makers of “Grok, the racist LLM,” losing it over $1 billion a month. I should be clear that if OpenAI does not convert to a for-profit, there is no path forward. To continue raising capital, OpenAI must have the promise of an IPO. It must go public, because at a valuation of $300 billion, OpenAI can no longer be acquired, because nobody has that much money and, if let’s be real, nobody actually believes OpenAI is worth that much. The only way to prove that anybody does is to take OpenAI public, and that will be impossible if it cannot convert. And, ironically, Softbank’s large and late-stage participation makes any exit harder, as early investors will see their holdings diluted as a percentage of total equity — or whatever the hell we’re calling it. While a normal company could just issue equity, and deal with the dilution that way, OpenAI’s structure necessitates a negotiation where companies can obstruct the entire process if they see fit. Speaking of companies that might obstruct that transition, let’s talk about Microsoft. As I asked in my premium newsletter a few weeks ago, what if Microsoft doesn’t want OpenAI to convert? It owns all the IP, it owns access to all OpenAI’s research, and already runs most of its infrastructure. While — assuming a best-case scenario — that it would end up owning a massive chunk of the biggest tech startup of all time (I’m talking about equity, not OpenAI’s current profit-sharing units), Microsoft might also believe that it stands more to gain by letting AI die and assuming its role in the AI ecosystem. Embrace. Extend. Extinguish. But let’s assume it converts, and OpenAI now…has to continue raising money at a rate that will require it, allegedly, to only need to raise $17 billion in 2027. That number doesn’t make sense, considering it already had to bring forward its $8.3 billion fundraise by at least three months, but let’s stick with that idea. OpenAI believes it will be profitable, somehow, by 2030, and even if we assume that, that means it intends to burn over a hundred billion dollars to get there. Is the plan to take OpenAI public, dumping a toxic asset onto the public markets, only to let it flounder and convulse and die for all to see? Can you imagine OpenAI’s S-1? How well do you think this company would handle a true financial audit from a major accounting firm? If you want to know what that looks like, google “WeWork,” which went from tech industry darling to joke in a matter of days, in part because it was forced to disclose how bad things actually were on its S-1. No, really, read this article. With that in mind, I feel similarly about Anthropic. Nobody is buying this company at $170 billion, and thus the only way to access liquidity would be to take it public, and show the world how a company that made $72 million in January 2025 and then more than $400 million in July 2025 also loses $3 billion or more after revenue, and then let the market decide on its fair price. The arguments against my work always come down to “costs will go down” and “these products will become essential.” Outside of ChatGPT, there’s really no proof that these products are anything remotely essential, and I argue there’s very little about ChatGPT that Microsoft couldn’t provide with rate limits via Copilot. I’d also argue that “essential” is a very subjective term. Essential — in the sense that some people use it as search — doesn’t mean that it’s useful for enterprises, or the majority of people. And, I guess, ChatGPT somehow makes $1 billion a month in revenue selling access to premium versions of ChatGPT — though I’m not 100% sure how. Assuming it has 20 million customers paying $20 a month, that’s $400 million a month, then 5 million business customers paid an average of $100 each, that’s $900 million…and is that average really that good? Are that many people paying $35 a month, or $50, or $200? OpenAI doesn’t break out the actual revenues behind these numbers for a reason, and I believe that reason is “they don’t look as good.” What’s OpenAI’s churn like? And does it really, as I wrote last week, end the year making more than Spotify at $1.5 billion a month? We don’t know, and OpenAI (much like Anthropic) has never shared actual revenues, choosing instead to leak to the media and hope to obfuscate the actual amounts of money being spent on its services. Anyway, long story short, these companies are unprofitable with no end in sight, don’t even make that much money in most cases, are valued more than anybody would ever buy them for, do not have much in the way of valuable intellectual property, and the two biggest players burn billions of dollars more than they make. Even if this were going to happen — it will not! — who would they give the money to and for how long? Would they give it to all the startups? Is every startup going to get a Paycheck Protection Program but for generative AI? How would that play out in rural red districts (where big tech has never been popular), which are being hit with both massive cuts to welfare, as well as the shockwaves of a trade war that has made American agricultural exports (like feedstocks, which previously went to China by the shipload) less appealing worldwide? So they bail out OpenAI, then stuff it full of government contracts to the tune of $15 billion a year, right? Sorry, just to be clear, that’s the low end of what this would take to do, and they’ll have to keep doing it forever, until Sam Altman can build enough data centers to…keep burning billions, because there’s no actual plan to make this profitable. Say this happens. Now what? America has a bullshit generative AI company attached to the state that doesn’t really innovate and doesn’t really matter in any meaningful way, except that it owns a bunch of data centers? I don’t think this happens! I think this is a silly idea, and the most likely situation would be that Microsoft would unhinge its jaw and swallow OpenAI and its customers whole. Hey, did you know that Microsoft’s data center construction is down year-over-year, and it’s basically signed no new data center leases? I wonder why it isn’t building these new data centers for OpenAI? Who knows. Stargate isn’t saving it, either. As I wrote previously, Stargate doesn’t actually exist beyond the media hype it generated. And yes, OpenAI is offering ChatGPT at $1 for a year to US government workers - and I cannot express how little this means other than that they are horribly desperate. This product doesn't do enough to make it essential, and this fire sale doesn't change anything. Anyway, does the government do this for everybody? Because everyone else is gonna need it as none of these companies can go public as they all suffer from the burden of generative AI. And, if the government does it, will it also subsidize the compute of for-profit companies like Cursor? To what end? Where is the limit? I think this is a question that we have to seriously consider at this point, because its ramifications are significant. If I’m honest, I think the future of LLMs will be client-side on egregiously-expensive personal setups for enthusiasts, and in a handful of niche enterprise roles. Large Language Models do not scale profitably, and their functionality is not significant enough to justify the costs of running them. By immediately applying old economics — the idea that you would pay a monthly fee to have relatively-unlimited access — companies like OpenAI and Anthropic immediately trained users to use their products in a way that was antithetical to their costs. Then again, had these models been served in a way that was mindful of their costs, there would likely have been no way to even get this far. If OpenAI is making a billion dollars a month, it is possibly losing that much (or more) after revenue, and that’s the money it can get selling the product in a form that can never turn profitable. If OpenAI charged in line with its actual costs, would it even be able to justify a freely-available version of ChatGPT, outside of a few free requests? The revenue you see today is what people are willing to pay for a product that loses money, and I cannot imagine they would pay as much if the companies in question charged their costs. If I’m wrong, Cursor will be just fine, and that’s assuming that Cursor’s current hobbled form is even profitable, which it has not said it is. So, you’ve got an entire industry of companies that struggle to do anything other than lose a lot of money. Great. And now we have a massive expansive data centre buildout, the likes of which we’ve never seen, all to capture demand for a product that nobody makes much money selling. This, naturally, leads to an important question: how do these people building data centers actually make money? Last week, the Wall Street Journal published one of the more worrying facts I’ve seen in the last two years: The massive buildout of data centers — and the associated physical gear like chips, servers, and raw materials for building them — has become a massive, dominant economic force…building capacity for an industry that is yet to prove it can make real revenues. And no, Microsoft talking about its Azure revenue in its last quarterly earnings for the first time is not the same thing, as it stopped explicitly stating their AI revenue in January (when it was $13 billion annualized). Anyway, AI capex allegedly — though I have some questions about this figure! — accounts for 1.2% of the US GDP in the first half of the year, and accounted for more than half of the (to quote the Wall Street Journal) “already-sluggish” 1.2% growth rate of the US economy. Another Wall Street Journal piece published a few days later discussed how data center development is souring the free cash flow for big tech, turning them from the kind of “asset-light” businesses that the markets love into entities burdened by physical real estate and their associated costs: These numbers are all very scary, and I mean that sincerely, but they also fail to express why. How much was actually spent on AI capex in the US? One would think two different articles on this subject would include that number versus a single quarter’s worth, but from my estimates, I expect capital expenditures from the Magnificent Seven alone to crest $200 billion in the first half of 2025, with Axios estimating they’d spend around $400 billion this year. Most articles are drafting off of a blog from Paul Kedrosky, who estimates total AI capex would be somewhere in the region of $520 billion in total for the year, which felt conservative to me, so I did the smart thing and asked him. Kedrosky noted that these numbers focus entirely on the four big spenders — Microsoft, Google, Meta and Amazon, and his own estimated $312 billion capex, and the 1.2% number came from the assumption that the US GDP in 2025 will be around $28 trillion (which, I add, is significantly lower than other forecasts, which puts it closer to $30 trillion). Kedrosky, in his own words, was trying to be conservative, using public data and then building his analysis from there. I, personally, believe his estimate is too conservative — because it doesn’t factor in the capital expenditures from Oracle, which (along with Crusoe) is building the vast Abilene Texas data center for OpenAI, or any private data center developers sinking cash into AI capex. When I asked him to elaborate, he estimated that “...AI spend, all-in, was around half of 3.0% Q2 real GDP growth, so 2-3x the lower bound, given multipliers, debt, etc. it could be half of US GDP full-year GDP growth.” That’s so cool! Half of the US economy’s growth came from building data centers for generative AI, which has the combined revenue of a little more than the fucking smart watch industry in 2024. Another troubling point is that big tech doesn’t just buy data centers and then use them, but in many cases pays a construction company to build them, fills them with GPUs and then leases them from a company that runs them, meaning that they don’t have to personally staff up and maintain them. This creates an economic boom for construction companies in the short term, as well as lucrative contracts for ongoing support…as long as the company in question still wants them. While Microsoft or Amazon might use a data center and, indeed, act as if it owns it, ultimately somebody else is holding the bag and the ultimate responsibility for the data centers. One such company is QTS, a data center developer that leases to both Amazon and Meta according to the New York Times, which was acquired by Blackstone in 2021 for $10 billion. Since then, Blackstone has used commercial mortgage-backed securities — I know! — to raise over $8.7 billion since then to sink into QTS’ expansion, and as of mid-July said it’d be investing $25 billion in AI data centers and energy. Blackstone, according to the New York Times, sees “strong demand from tech companies,” who are apparently “willing to sign what they describe as airtight leases for 15 to 20 years to rent out data center space.” Yet the Times also names another problem — the “unanswered question” of how these private equity firms actually exit these situations. Blackstone, KKR and other asset management firms do not buy companies with the intention of syphoning off revenue, but to pump them up and sell them to another company. Much like AI startups, it isn’t obvious who would buy QTS at what I imagine would be a $25 billion or $30 billion valuation, meaning that Blackstone would have to take them public. Similarly, KKR’s supposed $50 billion partnership with investment firm Energy Capital partners to build data centers and their associated utilities does not appear to have much of an exit plan either. And let’s not forget Oracle, OpenAI, and Crusoe’s abominable mess in Abilene Texas, where Oracle is paying for the $40 billion of GPUs and Crusoe is spending $15 billion raised from Blue Owl Capital and Primary Digital infrastructure to build data centers for OpenAI, a company that loses billions of dollars a year. Why? So that OpenAI can, allegedly starting in 2028, pay Oracle $30 billion a year for compute, and yes, I am being fully serious. To be clear, OpenAI, by my estimates, has only made around $5.26 billion this year (and will have trouble hitting its $12.7 billion revenue projection for 2025), and will likely lose more than $10 billion to do so. Oracle will, according to The Information, owe Crusoe $1 billion in payments across the 15 year span of its lease. How does Crusoe afford to pay back its $15 billion in loans? Beats me! The Information says it’s raising $1 billion to “take on cloud giants” by “earning construction management fees and rent, and it can sell its stake in the project upon reaching certain completion milestones,” while also building its own AI compute, making the assumption that the demand is there outside of hyperscalers. Then there’s CoreWeave, my least-favourite company in the world. As I discussed a few months ago, CoreWeave is burdened by obscene debt and a horrifying cash burn, and has seen its stock spike to a high of $183 on June 20, 2025 to around $111 as of writing this sentence, which has led to its all-stock attempt to acquire developer Core Scientific for $9 billion to start to fall apart as shareholders balk at the worrisome drop in CoreWeave’s stock price. CoreWeave has, since going public, had to borrow billions of dollars to fund its obscene capital expenditures to handle the upcoming October 2025 start date for OpenAI’s $11.9 billion, 5-year-long deal for compute, which is also when CoreWeave must start paying off its largest loan. CoreWeave lost $314 million in its last earnings, and I see no path to profitability or, honestly, its ability to keep doing business if the market sours. Coreweave, I add, is pretty much reliant on Microsoft as its primary customer. While this relationship has been fairly smooth (so far, and as far as we know), this dependence also presents an existential threat to Coreweave, and is part of the reason why I’m so pessimistic about its survival. Microsoft has its own infrastructure, and has every incentive to cut out middlemen when it's able to meet supply with the demand it itself owns (or leases, rather than subcontracts out), simply because middlemen add costs and shrink margins. If Microsoft walks, what’s left? How does it service its ongoing obligations, and its mountain of debt? In all of these cases, data center developers seem to have very few options as to making actual money. We have companies spending billions of dollars to vastly expand their data center footprint, but very little evidence that doing so results in revenue let alone some sort of payoff, and similarly, the actual capital expenditures they’re making are…much smaller than those of big tech. Digital Realty Trust — one of the largest developers with over 300 data centers worldwide and $5.55 billion in revenue in 2024 — only spent $3.5 billion in capex last quarter, and Equinix ($8.7 billion revenue in 2024), which has 270 of them, put capex at $3.5 billion too. NTT Global Data Centers, which has over 160 data centers, has dedicated $10 billion in capital expenditures “through 2027” to build out data centers. Yet in many of these cases, it’s because these companies are — to quote a source of mine — “functionally obsolete for this cycle,” because legacy data centers are not plug-and-play ready for GPUs to slot into. Any investment in capex by these companies would have to be for both GPUs and either building or retrofitting (basically ripping the insides out of old) data centers. This means that the money flowing into AI data centers is predominantly going to neoclouds like CoreWeave and Crusoe, and all seems to flow back to private equity firms that never thought about where the cashout might be. Blackstone led CoreWeave’s $7.5 billion loan with Magnetar Capital, and Crusoe signed a deal a week ago with infrastructure firm Blackstone-owned Tallgrass to build a data center in Wyoming, all of which seems very good for Blackstone unless you think “how does it actually make money here,” as private equity firms do not generally like to hold assets longer than five years. Even if it did, its capital expenditures are a drop in the bucket in the grand scheme of things. Assuming Crusoe burns, as The Information suggests it will, as much as $4 billion in 2025, CoreWeave spends as much as $20 billion, Digital Realty Trust spends $14 billion, Global Data Centers spends $3.33 billion (that’s $10bn over 3 years), and Equinix spends $14 billion. That’s $55.33 billion in AI capex spent in 2025 from the largest developers of data centers in the world. For some context, as discussed above, $102 billion was spent by Meta, Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon in the last quarter. Private equity may ultimately face the same problem as many AI startups: there is no clear exit strategy for these investments. In the absence of real liquidity, firms will likely resort to all manner of financial engineering (read: bullshit) —marking up portfolio companies using internally generated valuations, charging fees on those inflated marks, and using those marks to entice new commitments from limited partners. Compounding this is their ability to lend increasing amounts of capital to their own portfolio companies via affiliated private credit vehicles—effectively recycling capital and pushing valuation risk further down the line. This kind of self-reinforcing leverage loop is particularly opaque in private credit, which now underpins much of the AI infrastructure buildout. The complexity of these arrangements makes it hard to anticipate the full economic fallout if the cycle breaks down, but the systemic risk is building. In any case, the supposed “AI capex boom” that is driving the US economy is not, as reported, driven by the massive interest in building out AI infrastructure for a variety of customers. The reality is simple: the majority of all AI capex is from big tech, which is a massive systemic weakness in our economy. While some might say that “AI capex” has swallowed the US economy, I think it’s more appropriate to say that Big Tech Capex Has Swallowed The US Economy. I also want to be clear that the economy — which is the overall state of the country’s production and consumption of stuff, and the flow of money between participants in said economy — and the markets (as in the stock market) are very different things, but the calculations from Kedrosky and others have now allowed us to see where one might hit the other. You see, the markets do not actually represent reality. While Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Meta might want you to think there’s a ton of money in AI, their growth is mostly from selling further iterations and contracts for their existing stuff, or in the case of Meta further increasing its ad revenue. The economy is where things are actually bought and sold, representing the economic effects of both the things happening to build out AI and selling access to services and the AI models themselves. I recognize this is simplistic, but I am laying it out for a reason. As I discussed at length in the Hater’s Guide to the AI Bubble, NVIDIA is the weak point in the stock market, representing roughly 19% of the value of the Magnificent 7, which in turn makes up about 35% of the value of the US stock market. The associated Magnificent Seven stocks have seen a huge boom through their own growth, which has been mistakenly and incorrectly attributed to revenue from AI, which as I laid out previously, is about $35 to $40 billion in the last two years. Nevertheless, the markets can continue to be irrational because all they care about is “number going up,” as the “value” of a stock is oftentimes disconnected from the value of the company itself, instead associated with its propensity for growth. GDP and other measurements of the economy aren’t really something you can fudge quite as easily (at least, in transparent, democratic societies), nor can you say a bunch of fancy words to make people feel better in the event that growth stalls or declines. This leads me to my principle worry: that “AI capex” is actually a term for the expenditures of four companies, namely Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Meta, with NVIDIA’s GPU sales being part of that capex too. While we can include others like Oracle, Musk’s xAI, and various Neoclouds like CoreWeave and Crusoe — who, according to D.A. Davidson’s Gil Luria, will account for about 10% of NVIDIA’s GPU sales in 2025 — the reality is that whatever economic force is being driven by “AI investment” is really just four companies building and leasing data centers to burn on generative AI, a product that makes a relatively small amount of money before losing a great deal more. 42% of NVIDIA’s revenue comes from the Magnificent Seven (per Laura Bratton at Yahoo Finance), which naturally means that big tech is the lynchpin of investment in data centers. I’ll put it far more simply: if AI capex represents such a large part of our GDP and economic growth, our economy does, on some level, rest on the back of Microsoft, Google, Meta and Amazon and their continued investment in AI. What should worry everybody is that Microsoft — which makes up 18.9% of NVIDIA’s revenue — has signed basically no leases in the last 12 months, and its committed datacenter construction and land purchases are down year-over-year. While its capex may not have dipped yet (in part because the chip-heavy nature of generative AI means that capex isn’t exclusively dominated by property), it’s now obvious that if it does there will be direct effects on both the US economy and stock market, as Microsoft is part of what amounts to a stimulus package propping up America’s economic growth. And not to repeat the point too much, but big tech has yet to actually turn anything resembling a profit on these data centers, and isn’t making much revenue at all out of generative AI. How, exactly, does this end? What is the plan here? Is big tech going to spend hundreds of billions a year in capital expenditures on generative AI in perpetuity? Will they continue to buy more and more NVIDIA chips as they do so? At some point, surely these companies have built enough data centers? Surely, at some point, they’ll run out of space to put these GPUs in? Is the plan to, by then, make so much money from AI that it won’t matter? What does NVIDIA do at that point? And how does the US economy rebound from the loss of activity that follows? As I’ve said again and again, the generative AI bubble is, and always has been, fundamentally irrational, and inherently gothic, playing in the ruins, patterns and pathways of previous tech booms despite this one having little or no resemblance to them. Though the tech industry loves to talk about building a glorious future, its present is one steeped in rituals of decay and death, where the virtues of value creation and productivity take a backseat to burning billions and lying to the public again and again and again. The way in which the media has participated in these lies is disgusting. Venture capital, still drunk off the fumes of 2021, keeps running the old playbook: shove as much money into a company as possible in the hopes you can dump it onto an acquirer or the public markets, only to get high on their own supply, pushing valuations to the point that there is no possible liquidity event for the majority of big private AI companies as a result of their overstuffed valuations, burdensome business models and lack of any real intellectual property. And, like the rest of the AI bubble, Silicon Valley’s only liquidity path out of the bubble is big tech itself. Without Google, Character.ai and Windsurf’s founders would likely have been left for dead, and the same goes for Inflection, and I’d even argue Scale AI, whose $14.3 billion “investment” from Meta effectively decapitated the company, removing its CEO Alexandr Wang, leaving the rest of the company to die, laying off 14% of its staff and 500 contractors mere weeks after its CEO and investors cashed in. In fact, generative AI is turning out to be a fever dream entirely made up by big tech. OpenAI would be dead if it wasn’t for the massive infrastructure provided by Microsoft at-cost in return for rights to its IP, research, and the ability to sell its models on top of the tens of billions of dollars of venture capital thrown into its billion-dollar cash incinerator. Anthropic would be dead if both Google and Amazon — the latter of which provides much of its infrastructure — hadn’t invested billions in keeping it alive so that it can burn $3 billion or more in 2025 while fucking over its enterprise customers and rate limiting the rest. The generative AI industry is, at its core, unnatural. It does not make significant revenue compared to its unbelievable costs, nor does it have much revenue potential. It requires, unlike just about every software revolution, an unbelievable amount of physical infrastructure to run, and because nobody but big tech can afford to build the infrastructure necessary, creates very little opportunity for competition or efficiency. As the markets are in the throes of the growth-at-all-costs Rot Economy, they have failed to keep big tech in line, conflating big tech’s ability to grow with growth driven as a result of their capital expenditures. Sensible, reasonable markets would notice the decay of free cash flow or the ridiculousness of big tech’s capex bonanza, but instead they clap and squeal every time Satya Nadella jingles his keys. What is missing is any real value generation. Again, I tell you, put aside any feelings you may have about generative AI itself, and focus on the actual economic results of this bubble. How much revenue is there? Why is there no profit? Why are there no exits? Why does big tech, which has sunk hundreds of billions of dollars into generative AI, not talk about the revenues they’re making? Why, for three years straight, have we been asked to “just wait and see,” and for how long are we going to have to wait to see it? What’s incredible is that the inherently compute-intensive nature of generative AI basically requires the construction of these facilities, without actually representing whether they are contributing to the revenues of the companies that operate the models (like Anthropic or OpenAI, or any other business that builds upon them). As the models get more complex and hungry, more data centers get built — which hyperscalers book as long-term revenue, even though it’s either subsidised by said hyperscalers, or funded by VC money. This, in turn, stimulates even more capex spending. And without having to answer any basic questions about longevity or market fit. Yet the worst part of this financial farce is that we’ve now got a built-in economic breaking point in the capex from AI. At some point capex has to slow — if not because of the lack of revenues or massive costs associated, but because we live in a world with finite space, and when said capex slow happens, so will purchases of NVIDIA GPUs, which will in turn, as proven by Kedrosky and others, slow America’s economic growth. And that growth is pretty much based on the whims of four companies, which is an incredibly risky and scary proposition. I haven’t even dug into the wealth of private credit deals that underpin buildouts for private AI “neoclouds” like CoreWeave, Crusoe, Nebius, and Lambda, in part because their economic significance is so much smaller than big tech’s ugly, meaningless sprawl. To quote Kedrosky: You can’t bail this out, because there is nothing to bail out. Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Google have plenty of money and have proven they can spend it. NVIDIA is already doing everything it can to justify people spending more on its GPUs. There’s little more it can do here other than soak up the growth before the party ends. That capex reduction will bring with it a reduction in expenditures on NVIDIA GPUs, which will take a chunk out of the US stock market. Although the stock market isn’t the economy, the two things are inherently linked, and the popping of the AI bubble will have downstream ramifications, just like the dot com bubble did on the wider economy. Expect to see an acceleration in layoffs and offshoring, in part driven by a need for tech companies to show — for the first time in living memory — fiscal restraint. For cities where tech is a major sector of the economy — think Seattle and San Francisco — there’ll be knock-on effects to those companies and individuals that support the tech sector (like restaurants, construction companies building apartments, Uber drivers, and so on). We’ll see a drying-up of VC funding. Pension funds will take a hit — which will affect how much people have to spend in retirement. It’ll be grim. Worse than that is the fact that these data centers will be, by definition, non-performing assets, and one that inflicted an opportunity cost that’ll be almost impossible to calculate. While a house, once built and sold, technically falls into that category (it doesn’t add to any economic productivity), people at least need somewhere to live. Shelter is an essential component of life. You can live without a data center the size of Manhattan. What would have happened if companies like Microsoft and Meta instead spent the money on things that actually drove productivity, or created a valuable competitive business that drove economic activity? Hell, even if they just gave everyone a 10% raise, it would have likely been better for the economy than this, if we’re factoring in things like consumer spending. It’s just waste. Profligate, pointless waste. In summary, we’re already facing the prospect of a recession, and though I am not an economist, I can imagine it being a particularly nasty one given that the Magnificent Seven accounted for 47.87% of the Russell 1000 Index’s returns in 2024. Even if big tech somehow makes this crap profitable, it’s hard to imagine that they’ll counterbalance any capex reduction with revenue, because there doesn’t seem to be that much revenue in generative AI to begin with. This is what happens when you allow the Rot Economy to run wild, building the stock market and tech industry on growth over everything else. This is what happens when the tech media repeatedly fails to hold the powerful to account, catering to their narratives and making excuses for their abominable, billion-dollar losses and mediocre, questionably-useful products. Waffle on all you want about the so-called “agentic era” or “annualized revenues” that make you hot under the collar — I see no reason for celebration about an industry with no exit plans and needless capital expenditures that appear to be one of the few things keeping the American economy growing. I have been writing about the tech industry’s obsession with generative AI for two years, and never have I felt more grim. Before this was an economic uncertainty — a way that our markets might contract, that big tech might take a big haircut, that a bunch of money might be wasted but otherwise the world would keep turning. It feels as if everything is aligning for disaster, and I fear there’s nothing that can be done to avert it. Subscribe today. It's free. Please. Great! You’ve successfully signed up. Welcome back!
