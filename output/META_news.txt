October 12, 2025 19:30 ET | Source: Faraday Future Faraday Future LOS ANGELES, Oct. 12, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc. (NASDAQ: FFAI) (“Faraday Future”, “FF” or the “Company”), a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company, today shared a weekly business update from YT Jia, Founder and Global Co-CEO of FF. “Welcome to the 24th issue of our Weekly Report. Sorry for showing up in a cap today. I’ve been dealing with a very serious case of shingles on my head these past few days, which has affected my condition a bit. Everyone, please also take good care of your health and get enough rest. On EAI Flywheel this week, starting with S1 User Ecosystem: This week, FX signed a deposit agreement for 1,000 units of FX Super One with ZEVO, the pioneer of peer-to-peer EV sharing platform in the U.S. The agreement includes non-refundable deposits and non-binding preorders, and the non-refundable deposit has already been received. The signing of this agreement not only marks that FX’s Co-Creation Ecosystem Online Direct Sales model has expanded into Texas, the second-largest EV market in the United States. It also represents another innovative breakthrough in our B2B2C sales model. Following the car rental, FX Par, real estate brokerage, and MCN agencies, FX has now also entered the rapidly growing peer-to-peer car-sharing market. Based in Dallas, ZEVO not only allows individual car owners to list their own EVs for user-to-user sharing but also provides flexible short-term rental programs for ride-hailing and instant-delivery drivers. Its business has now expanded to core cities in Texas, California, Arizona, Florida, and Nevada. Through the cooperation with ZEVO, FX not only further expands the sales and use cases of FX Super One, but is also expected to speed up the implementation of our co-creation and sharing ecosystem. At the same time, when the car-sharing business and CXC10’s Three Growth Engines spark meta-chemistry — especially through the EAI + Crypto Dual-Bridge RWA products — new possibilities will emerge. The value of real-world mobility will be redefined and expanded in Web3 scenarios. This meta-chemistry could greatly accelerate the convergence of Web2 and Web3, and of EAI and Crypto, creating the greatest value for our stockholders. This week, we also held a "Car Home Crypto Co-Creation" delivery event with Pinnacle. Calvin Gong is our first Co-Creation Officer since we announced the “EAI + Crypto” Dual Flywheel & Dual Bridge Eco-Strategy. We look forward to creating meta-chemistry between real estate, automotive, and crypto together with industry leaders like Pinnacle. This could help us co-create greater value and enable users to share more benefits. Now going to S2-4 Product & Technology, Supply Chain, Production & Delivery: The FX Super One U.S. year-end vehicle off-line target has officially entered the final two-month sprint stage. This week, the company established a dedicated project team to coordinate and drive the work. Key areas — including engineering, supply chain, homologation, manufacturing and so on— are all accelerating across the board. On S6 Middle East: Our global teams are working across three locations in full force to prepare for the October 28th UAE Super One Product Final Launch. As the strategic third pole, the UAE will host its major Super One product launch for the first time and take the lead in initial vehicle deliveries — a milestone of great significance for FF and FX’s global strategic layout. The experience gained through this event will also help ensure the smooth progress of the upcoming vehicle off-line and final launch activities in the U.S. Going to S7, Capability and System Build-Up: This week, members of our government affairs team were invited to attend a gala in Washington D.C. that brought together political, media and entrepreneurial leaders from across the U.S. We continue to strengthen our government affairs capabilities, and they are making progress assisting the company in public sector engagement, policy incentives, tariff strategy, and more. Now let’s look at the Crypto flywheel: Following the completion of the strategic investment in Qualigen (QLGN), the Crypto team has been advancing its business operations while accelerating the transition work. The special meeting of QLGN stockholders is currently scheduled for November 2025. If the transaction is approved, QLGN is expected to be rebranded as CXC10, marking the beginning of a new chapter in Crypto and AI operations for that company. Next week, we will announce a major milestone related to the first FX Super One vehicle off-line target in the United States. Please stay tuned for the update. Okay, I'll see you later.” ABOUT FARADAY FUTURE Faraday Future is a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company.

Title: The Digital Asset Treasury Playbook: How to Print, Buy and Compound to ‘Alchemise’ mNAV into a Market Engine

Time Published: 2025-10-12T20:21:00Z

About us Copy link Just a couple months ago, digital asset treasuries were crypto’s hottest trade. Spurred by soaring valuations, hundreds of companies raced to accumulate Bitcoin, Ether, and other digital assets. The mania has cooled in recent weeks. Companies that saw their stock soar after announcing multimillion-dollar crypto purchases are now trading at a discount relative to that crypto. Still, some are holding strong, with their mNAV — short for market-cap-to-net-asset-value multiple — comfortably in the black. How do the do it? In the LlamaU article below, pseudonymous DefiLlama analyst Meta explains the drivers of mNAV premiums, as well as examples where the logic behind those premiums “breaks.” (Read Meta’s previous article: What is mNAV? How to calculate and trade it? Your DefiLlama guide to the metric for digital asset treasuries) DATs are no longer just holding crypto — they’re leveraged to actively expand their own holdings and valuations. They aren’t just ‘hodl’ing tokens; it has become a competitive game of accumulation. DATs are trading their own market caps against themselves, turning investor sentiment into capital and capital into narrative fuel. This new species of equity, known as Digital Asset Treasuries (DATs), sits at the intersection of corporate finance and crypto reflexivity. Their fundamentals are blockchain-based, their premiums narrative-driven, and their strategies systematic: print, buy, compound, repeat. What began as an experiment with MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin accumulation model has evolved into a broader movement spanning Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, and beyond. Today, SBET, BMNR, and others have creatively applied the same reflexive mechanics to staking yield, token diversification, and capital recycling; transforming what used to be static balance sheets into market engines. mNAV = Fully Diluted Market Cap ÷ Treasury Value (USD) 1.0x → equity equals treasury value (fair) > 1.0x → investors pay a premium for leverage, yield, or access < 1.0x → the stock trades at a discount to its underlying crypto If you’re new to mNAV or want a step-by-step breakdown of how it’s calculated, “HYPE DAT Ecosystem: A Clean Case Study for mNAV” is where you want to start. A premium can be narrative-driven, structural, engineered, or yield-supported. When these align, mNAV becomes less a ratio and more a reaction: a positive feedback loop between equity and treasury that refines sentiment into capital. MicroStrategy pioneered the quintessential DAT model; they codified, refined, and evolved their procedure making them the gold standard. Below is the company’s official equity guidance slide from Exhibit 99.1 (August 2025): MSTR Equity Guidance screenshot MicroStrategy pioneered the quintessential DAT model. Its strategy slide divides valuation into mNAV zones, each dictating a different capital playbook: - Active: issue equity aggressively to buy more Bitcoin - Opportunistic: issue selectively during favorable sentiment - Tactical: issue sparingly for debt or liquidity needs - Defensive: may use credit to repurchase stock Active issuance expands Bitcoin holdings through ATMs (At-the-Market equity offering, where companies sell newly issued shares directly on to the open market), convertibles, and secondary offerings. Opportunistic issuance occurs briefly, often above 3x mNAV, allowing controlled compounding with minimal dilution. Tactical issuance covers debt or dividends without selling BTC. Defensive stance slows issuance or uses credit to repurchase shares, supporting the stock’s floor and resetting the flywheel. This structure turns capital markets into a feedback engine. When mNAV rises, MicroStrategy issues to buy BTC. When it falls, issuance tightens or reverses through buybacks. Dilution becomes reflexive compounding. The simplest catalyst for premiums or discounts is positioning versus entry cost. When a DAT’s treasury sits above its average purchase price, the market usually assigns a premium (>1x mNAV). Below cost, the market discounts it. Across the DeFiLlama Digital Asset Treasuries dashboard, profitable treasuries consistently trade higher while underwater ones remain cheap. Examples include: - MSTR (MicroStrategy) — BTC Treasury, Above Basis → Premium (mNAV ~1.5x) - KIDZ (Classover) — SOL Treasury, Above Basis → Premium (mNAV 2.1x–3.5x) - UPXI (Upexi) — SOL Treasury, Max FD lens → mNAV ~1.5x - MARA (Marathon Digital) — BTC + Infrastructure Premium (1.2x–1.7x) - NAKA (Nakamoto Holdings) — High BTC Entry → Discount (0.5x–0.8x) - BTBT (Bit Digital) — ETH Treasury w/ Yield → Premium (>1x) Premiums also form along jurisdictional and regulatory lines — where access or taxation changes valuation dynamics. Metaplanet Inc. (OTC: MTPLF, TSE: 3350.T) is Japan’s flagship Bitcoin treasury and one of the clearest cases of jurisdictional alchemy. Under Japan’s tax code, corporations must mark crypto holdings to market annually and pay tax on unrealized gains. In contrast, capital gains on listed shares are taxed separately at an effective 20.315% (Japan National Tax Agency). This makes Metaplanet (MTPLF) a tax-deferred Bitcoin proxy, letting investors gain BTC exposure through equity. By holding Bitcoin through equity rather than directly, Metaplanet turns that asymmetry into a structural advantage, maintaining a 1.8x–2.0x mNAV with it at its peak having maintained >8x mNAV for weeks on end. A textbook case of tax alchemy: turning friction into premium. DATs in regulated markets can tap capital barred from direct token exposure. MicroStrategy succeeded because it epitomized this: a compliant, levered Bitcoin wrapper for institutions. Formerly CEA Industries, BNB Network Co. (BNC) is one of the few public DATs with direct BNB exposure. With no BNB ETF or trust in the U.S., it serves as a listed proxy for Binance’s ecosystem; similar to how MSTR fulfilled the role early on as the only institutional onramp for BTC exposure. It trades near 1.87x mNAV. Given that it is publicly endorsed and heavily invested into BNB DAT by the venture capital entity YZI Labs, formerly Binance Labs, which is officially funded and partnered with Binance itself. Until a formal BNB ETF exists, that scarcity alone supports the premium. Together, Metaplanet and BNB Network Co. show the geography of premium. Where Metaplanet turns Japan’s crypto tax disadvantage into equity advantage, BNC leverages America’s regulatory bottleneck on BNB exposure. Both convert policy friction into scarcity. Metaplanet provides the purest example of geopolitical arbitrage in the DAT playbook. SBET and BMNR pioneered ETH-based treasuries that generate yield natively. By staking directly on Ethereum, both earn validator-level returns (~3–5% APY) that continuously expand NAV. That yield compounds through feedback: staking generates rewards, NAV expands, the market reprices equity upward, and higher valuations reinforce the premium. The difference lies in the ingredients: mindshare, leadership, and visibility. SBET, with Joseph Lubin, cofounder of Ethereum, and Joseph Chalom, former Head of Digital Assets at BlackRock, has top tier pedigree however BMNR’s Tom Lee has a very public presence with his appearances on CNBC. This ends up likening Tom Lee to MSTR’s legendary Saylor whose loud, consistent, charismatic bullishness were undeniable variables in the success of establishing MicroStrategy as a household name. BMNR paralleled this best for the Ethereum DATS by staying on top via a combination of buybacks, retail engagement, and visible leadership. BTCS also earns ETH staking yield but trades below parity lending proof that yield alone can’t ignite the flywheel without narrative and conviction. Ultimately, yield is the base metal, and narrative, leadership, and timing are the reagents that determine whether it compounds or burns off. Some DATs diversify through moonshot allocations: small, high-beta bets meant to amplify upside or hedge decay. GameSquare (mNAV = ~1.11x) holds ETH, a CryptoPunk, and ANIME token positions. It trades slightly above parity, a modest premium for narrative diversification. BMNR allocated $20M into ORBS (formerly OCTO), a Worldcoin (WLD) DAT, at $1.46/share. By October 2025, ORBS traded above $10, a 6x gain. Clearly, these moonshots can convert asymmetric exposure into subtle mNAV leverage through optionality. Not all DATs follow the “profit = premium” or “association = value” logic. TRON (Ticker: TRON) – Despite profitable reserves and close ties to the TRON blockchain, the stock trades at a steep discount. TRON, which is the only TRX DAT treasury, trades at a 0.53x max fully diluted mNAV, Despite TRX hosting ~$77.5B in stablecoins, composed of ~98% USDT (DeFiLlama), and dominating transfers across Asia, Africa, and Latin America, in the West, it’s viewed as a transactional rail, not an investable asset, keeping its mNAV deeply discounted. Contrast this with BNB Network Co. (BNC). BNB’s exchange linkage and predictable revenue burns make it behave like equity. Binance uses a share of revenue to buy and burn BNB: a deliberate, showy, aggressive mechanism versus TRX’s passive gas burns. Traditional finance investors quickly recognize the pattern as an equity-like feedback loop, sustaining BNC’s 1.87x mNAV whereas TRX’s gas burning blockchain hasn’t attracted attention to TRON treasury keeping it below parity. Simply put: BNB’s burn program mirrors corporate buybacks, while TRX’s gas burns are passive and minor in comparison. BNC maintains premium; TRON does not. In numerical terms, the contrast between the two when examining max mNAV is astronomical: a difference of over 300%! BTCS, one of the first ETH staking firms, trades around 0.88x mNAV. SBET and BMNR captured attention with clear messaging and buybacks; BTCS remained quieter, focused on infrastructure over narrative. It delivers on-chain results but lacks social reflexivity; proof that legitimacy without visibility still prices like a discount. These cases show DAT premiums are behavioral, not mechanical. Narrative clarity, investor access, and perceived intentionality decide whether association becomes valuation. TRX dominates usage but not mindshare translating to a discount for TRON; BNB’s engineered burn loop mirrors equity translating to a premium for BNC as if accounting for revenue generation; and BTCS shows substance alone isn’t enough. In this market, numbers matter but narratives are the driver for positive multiples. In the DAT ecosystem, premiums aren’t random; they’re engineered. Every successful treasury blends fundamentals, narrative, and structure into a reflexive loop: fundamentals anchor value, narrative amplifies it, and capital strategy turns that feedback into growth. MicroStrategy utilizes financial wizardry to convert sentiment into Bitcoin. Metaplanet and BNC alchemize geography into premium through geopolitical arbitrage. BMNR, SBET, and GAME merge yield and narrative momentum. TRON and BTCS remind us that usage without story rarely sustains a premium. In this financial alchemy, fundamentals are the lead, narrative is the spark, and regulation is the catalyst that determines how brightly it burns.

Its revenue, profitability, and cash reserves have skyrocketed since the introduction of ChatGPT over two years ago — and the many competitive generative AI services that have launched since. Its stock price has soared, making it a $4.5 trillion market cap company. The world’s leading high-performance GPU maker has used its ballooning fortunes to significantly increase investments in startups, particularly in AI. Nvidia has participated in 50 venture capital deals so far in 2025, already surpassing the 48 deals the company completed in all of 2024, according to PitchBook data. Note that these investments exclude those made by its formal corporate VC fund, NVentures, which also significantly increased its investment pace over that period. (PitchBook says NVentures engaged in 21 deals this year, compared to just one in 2022.) Nvidia has stated that the goal of its corporate investing is to expand the AI ecosystem by backing startups it considers to be “game changers and market makers.” Below is a list of startups that raised rounds exceeding $100 million since 2023 where Nvidia is a named participant, organized from the highest to lowest amount raised in the round. This list shows just how far and wide Nvidia has spread its tentacles in the tech industry, beyond supplying its products. OpenAI: Nvidia backed the ChatGPT maker for the first time in October 2024, reportedly writing a $100 million check as part of a colossal $6.6 billion round that valued the company at $157 billion. The chipmaker’s investment was dwarfed by OpenAI’s other backers, notably Thrive, which according to the New York Times invested $1.3 billion. While PitchBook data indicates Nvidia did not participate in OpenAI’s $40 billion funding round that closed in March, the chipmaker announced in September that it would invest up to $100 billion in the company over time, structured as a strategic partnership to deploy massive AI infrastructure. xAI: In 2024, OpenAI tried to persuade its investors not to invest in any of its rivals. But Nvidia participated in the $6 billion round of Elon Musk’s xAI last December anyway. Nvidia will also invest up to $2 billion in the equity portion of xAI’s planned $20 billion funding round, Bloomberg reported, a deal structured to help xAI purchase more Nvidia gear. Mistral AI: Nvidia invested in Mistral for the third time when the French-based large language model developer raised €1.7 billion (about $2 billion) Series C at a €11.7billion ($13.5 billion) post-money valuation in September. Reflection AI: In October, Nvidia was one of the most significant investors in Reflection AI, contributing to a $2 billion funding round that valued the one-year-old startup at $8 billion. Reflection AI is positioning itself as a US-based competitor to Chinese DeepSeek, whose open-source large language model offers a less-expensive alternative to closed-source models from companies such as OpenAI and Anthropic. Thinking Machines Lab: Nvidia was among a long list of investors who backed former OpenAI Chief Technology Officer Mira Murati’s Thinking Machines Lab’s $2 billion seed round. The funding, which was formally announced in July, valued the new AI startup at $12 billion. Inflection: One of Nvidia’s first significant AI investments also had one of the more unusual (but increasingly common) outcomes. In June 2023, Nvidia was one of several lead investors in Inflection’s $1.3 billion round, a company co-founded by Mustafa Suleyman, the famed founder of DeepMind. Less than a year later, Microsoft hired Inflection’s founders, paying $620 million for a non-exclusive technology license, leaving the company with a significantly diminished workforce and a less defined future. Nscale: After the startup’s $1.1 billion round in September, Nvidia participated in Nscale’s $433 million SAFE funding in October. That’s a deal that secures future equity for investors. Nscale, which formed in 2023 after spinning out of Australian cryptocurrency mining company Akorn Energy, is building data centers in the UK and Norway for OpenAI’s Stargate project. Wayve: In May 2024, Nvidia participated in a $1.05 billion round for the U.K.-based startup, which is developing a self-learning system for autonomous driving. Nvidia is expected to invest an dditional $500 million in Wayve, the startup told TechCrunch in September. Wayve is testing its vehicles in the U.K. and the San Francisco Bay Area. Figure AI: In September, Nvidia participated in the Figure AI’s Series C funding round of over $1 billion, which valued the humanoid robotics startup at $39 billion. The chipmaker first invested in Figure in February 2024 when the company raised a $675 million Series B round at a $2.6 billion valuation. Scale AI: In May 2024, Nvidia joined Accel and other tech giants Amazon and Meta to invest $1 billion in Scale AI, which provides data-labeling services to companies for training AI models. The round valued the San Francisco-based company at nearly $14 billion. In June, Meta invested $14.3 billion for a 49% stake of Scale, and hired away the company’s co-founder and CEO Alexandr Wang, as well as several other key Scale employees. Commonwealth Fusion: The chipmaker participated in the nuclear fusion-energy startup’s $863 million funding round in August 2025. The deal, which also included investors like Google and Breakthrough Energy Ventures, valued the company at $3 billion. Crusoe: A startup building data centers reportedly to be leased to Oracle, Microsoft, and OpenAI raised $686 million in November 2024, according to an SEC filing. The investment was led by Founders Fund, and the long list of other investors included Nvidia. Cohere: The chipmaker has invested in enterprise large language model provider Cohere across multiple funding rounds, including the $500 million Series D, which closed in August, valuing Cohere at $6.8 billion. Nvidia first backed the Toronto-based startup in 2023. Perplexity: Nvidia first invested in Perplexity in November 2023 and has participated in most of the subsequent funding rounds of the AI search engine startup, including the $500 million round closed in December 2024. The chipmaker participated in the company’s July funding round, which valued Perplexity at $18 billion. However, Nvidia did not join the startup’s subsequent $200 million fundraise in September, which boosted the company’s valuation to $20 billion, according to PitchBook data. Poolside: In October 2024, the AI coding assistant startup Poolside announced it raised $500 million led by Bain Capital Ventures. Nvidia participated in the round, which valued the AI startup at $3 billion. Lambda: AI cloud provider Lambda, which provides services for model training, raised a $480 million Series D at a reported $2.5 billion valuation in February. The round was co-led by SGW and Andra Capital Lambda, and joined by Nvidia, ARK Invest, and others. A significant part of Lambda’s business involves renting servers powered by Nvidia’s GPUs. CoreWeave: Although CoreWeave is no longer a startup, but a public company, Nvidia invested in GPU-cloud provider when it was still one, back in April 2023. That’s when CoreWeave raised $221 million in funding. Nvidia remains a significant shareholder. Together AI: In February, Nvidia participated in the $305 million Series B of this company, which offers cloud-based infrastructure for building AI models. The round valued Together AI at $3.3 billion and was co-led by Prosperity7, a Saudi Arabian venture firm, and General Catalyst. Nvidia backed the company for the first time in 2023. Firmus Technologies: In September, Firmus Technologies, the Singapore-based data center company, received A$330 million (approximately $215 million USD) in funding at a A$1.85 billion ($1.2 billion USD) valuation from investors, including Nvidia. Firmus is developing an energy-efficient ‘AI factory’ in Tasmania, an island state of Australia. The startup originally provided cooling technologies for Bitcoin mining. Sakana AI: In September 2024, Nvidia invested in the Japan-based startup, which trains low-cost generative AI models using small datasets. The startup raised a massive Series A round of about $214 million at a valuation of $1.5 billion. Nuro: In August, Nvidia participated in the $203 million funding round for the self-driving startup focused on delivery. The deal valued Nuro at $6 billion, a significant 30% drop from its peak at $8.6 billion valuation in 2021. Imbue: The AI research lab that claims to be developing AI systems that can reason and code raised a $200 million round in September 2023 from investors, including Nvidia, Astera Institute, and former Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt. Waabi: In June 2024, the autonomous trucking startup raised a $200 million Series B round co-led by existing investors Uber and Khosla Ventures. Other investors included Nvidia, Volvo Group Venture Capital, and Porsche Automobil Holding SE. Ayar Labs: In December, Nvidia invested in the $155 million round of Ayar Labs, a company developing optical interconnects to improve AI compute and power efficiency. This was the third time Nvidia backed the startup. Kore.ai: The startup developing enterprise-focused AI chatbots raised $150 million in December of 2023. In addition to Nvidia, investors participating in the funding included FTV Capital, Vistara Growth, and Sweetwater Private Equity. Sandbox AQ: In April, Nvidia, alongside Google, BNP Paribas, and others, invested $150 million in Sandbox AQ, a startup developing large quantitative models (LQMs) for handling complex numerical analysis and statistical calculations. The investment increased Sandbox AQ’s Series E round to $450 million and the company’s valuation to $5.75 billion. Hippocratic AI: This startup, which is developing large language models for healthcare, announced in January that it raised a $141 million Series B at a valuation of $1.64 billion led by Kleiner Perkins. Nvidia participated in the round, along with returning investors Andreessen Horowitz, General Catalyst, and others.

Reminder, this is a Premium article and requires a subscription to read. One company is more valuable than all the listed companies in Canada, or the UK, or Germany, writes Mark Lister. THE FACTS It’s been a fantastic run for the United States sharemarket. The S&P 500 index is up 18% in the past 12 months, and 83% over three years. Even Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell has commented on this, noting that “equity prices are fairly highly valued” during a recent speech. To be fair, he was responding to a question, rather than feeling the need to proactively offer an opinion. For the record, I don’t believe US stocks are in a bubble. I do, however, agree they’re looking pricey. That means investors need to tread carefully, and think a little harder about how they spread their exposures. Valuations for the US market are at the highest levels we’ve seen in some time. The widely used price/earnings (PE) ratio is 22.8, well above the average since 1990 of 16.6 and the 18.7 average of the last decade. The only time it’s been higher was in the late 1990s, in the days that preceded the dotcom boom and bust. Things are eerily similar today, with the market strength being driven largely by companies associated with AI trends. The big three – Nvidia, Microsoft and Apple – together make up more than one-fifth of the S&P 500. Last month Deutsche Bank produced a fascinating chart to really put this into perspective. It showed how Nvidia’s market value had surpassed the total value of every country in the world’s entire listed stock exchange apart from the US, China, Japan and India. Let that sink in. One company is more valuable than all the listed companies in Canada, or the UK, or Germany. The US market is more concentrated than we’ve seen in decades and while that’s a risk, it also makes those PE comparisons less useful. The tech behemoths of 2025 have increasingly dominant positions, high margins and very profitable business models. Can you really compare them with the biggest companies of 20 years ago? In 2005 Exxon Mobil was the largest stock on the market, while Citigroup, General Electric and Walmart were in the top five. The earnings power of this class of 2025 is hugely exciting, if you’re a believer in the productivity growth potential of AI. It can’t be overstated how important this is, because it’s earnings growth that ultimately drives share prices (at least in the longer term). Earnings for the US tech sector grew 23% in the June quarter, relative to a year ago. The communication services sector (where the likes of Meta and Alphabet reside) saw an even larger gain of 46%. Looking ahead to 2026, analysts are projecting earnings growth for the S&P 500 index of almost 14%, double the long-term average of about 7%. The so-called Magnificent 7 are expected to contribute as much as two-thirds of this. Even if the earnings tailwinds can justify the higher valuations and keep pushing the US market higher, there’s a strong case for diversification right now. Other sharemarkets look more reasonable when we compare current valuations to long-term averages. The UK and Europe are trading in line with history, emerging market shares are only slightly higher, while Japan looks cheaper. Even within the US itself, there are sectors which have lagged and look better value. Healthcare, energy and real estate are trading in line with their longer-term average PE, while utilities and consumer staples are only at a modest premium. Each of those regions and sectors will be facing its own unique backdrop, and valuation alone isn’t an indicator of where prices will go in the next year or two. However, for investors feeling uneasy about the ongoing strength of American equities, there are plenty of ways to hedge your bets. Valuations across the US sharemarket are indeed high, but it could keep performing well if the economy remains resilient, the Fed keeps reducing interest rates and the tech sector keeps delivering solid earnings. At the same time, it would be unwise to ignore the risk things are a little overdone. The astute investor is probably ensuring they have an exposure to markets outside the US, while maintaining a healthy foothold in the world’s biggest economy.

Title: Why International Stocks Are Surging And What US Investors Should Know

ByBill Stone, Contributor. In aggregate, American business has done wonderfully over time and will continue to do so. – Warren Buffett After several years of underperformance, international stocks are outperforming the US, igniting a discussion about whether investors should increase their exposure to foreign stocks. A broad measure of international stock performance is the MSCI ACWI, excluding the US, which has a total return of 26.7% year-to-date through the third quarter. The MSCI ACWI index includes both developed and emerging markets. In comparison, the US’s S&P 500 has risen 14.8%. The MSCI EAFE is a subset of developed international markets, while the MSCI EM covers the stock markets of emerging countries. While past performance is not necessarily an indicator of future returns, investors in international stocks have been quite disappointed relative to US-centric investors over the past five, ten, and twenty years. Over the past twenty years, the S&P 500 has achieved a total return of 700.6%, significantly outperforming the 233.3% return from broad international markets. More about this later, but one of the major drivers for US stocks was the tremendous performance of the US technology sector, which soared by 2,053.8% over the last twenty years. An additional variable for US-based investors owning international stocks is the impact of foreign currencies. US investors experience higher returns from their international holdings when the US dollar depreciates relative to the foreign currency of the international stocks they own. Given the weakness of the US dollar relative to many currencies this year, this has juiced the returns of foreign stocks. In fact, the year-to-date move in currencies provided 9.3 percentage points of the 11.9 percentage points of outperformance of the MSCI ACWI Ex-US over the S&P 500. The year-to-date boost to international investments is unlikely to be repeated if history is any guide. In fact, foreign exchange has reduced the returns of US-based investors in foreign stocks over the past twenty years. Even the emerging market stock index that benefited the most from currency tailwinds only gained 68.7% over twenty years, due to foreign currency exposure, which equates to a 3% annualized gain resulting from currency translation. Despite the currency help, the S&P 500 outpaced emerging markets stocks by a wide margin. While some might extoll the virtues of currency diversification, most US investors have their liabilities almost exclusively in US dollars. Thus, an extensive currency mismatch between assets and liabilities should be viewed as a risk, not a positive attribute. Diversification is protection against ignorance. It makes little sense if you know what you are doing. – Warren Buffett Many academics and some practitioners argue that US investors suffer from a home country bias, as they do not own a sufficient number of international stocks to aid in diversification. They consider a market capitalization-weighted allocation to be a proper baseline, which suggests that US stocks should comprise 49% of a stock portfolio, according to their calculations. Beyond ignoring the foreign exchange risk, this argument overlooks the reality that the US occupies a privileged position relative to most countries. The US benefits from an embrace of capitalism and the rule of law. Furthermore, our markets are already fully diversified across sectors, which is not the case for all countries. Because many of our US companies are global leaders and competitors, over 40% of the revenues for the S&P 500 are sourced internationally, allowing investors to gain international exposure by holding large-cap US stocks. Another lens to consider is that an allocation to international indexes is a bet against technology. The S&P 500 is 35% technology, while the foreign markets' tech weighting is 14%. Instead, the international markets have a significantly higher exposure to financial companies and banks than the US. It is fair to argue that focusing solely on the technology sector overlooks the actual impact of technology leaders in the US. Adding Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META), and Alphabet (GOOGL) to the mix increases the technology-related US exposure to 46%. The US is fortunate to be home to many of the world's leading technology companies. While it can be debated whether technology is where you want to be overweight at the moment, those considering international index investing should be aware of the inherent wager in making that move. Another argument used by some advocates for international investing is that valuations are cheaper than in the US. The forward estimated price-to-earnings ratio is 14.7 times for international stocks versus the US's 22.1 times. While the valuation is lower, US stocks should trade at a higher valuation due to a superior return on equity, which measures the earnings that a company produces from the capital provided by shareholders. US companies also have superior profit margins, which is the percentage of revenue that ends up as bottom-line profits. The US technology sector is a crucial reason why the S&P 500 boasts exceptional profitability. There can be reasonable disagreements about the size of the valuation premium appropriate for US stocks. Still, the mere fact that international stocks as a whole are cheaper is necessary but not sufficient to argue for sustained outperformance from them. The five very successfully operate in a manner somewhat similar to Berkshire itself. – Warren Buffett referring to Berkshire Hathaway’s investment in the Japanese trading companies. Although the US has a large share, there are well-managed and dominant companies domiciled outside the country. Rather than a predetermined percentage allocation of a stock portfolio with international stocks, investors should seek specific opportunities worldwide, while being mindful of the additional risks associated with foreign currencies and particular locales. Even though he primarily invests in US securities, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK/A, BRK/B) can provide a good example. Berkshire Hathaway initially announced the acquisition of about 5% of five Japanese trading companies at the end of August 2020. These holdings are Itochu Corp., Marubeni Corp., Mitsubishi Corp., Mitsui & Co. Ltd., and Sumitomo Corp. In Buffett's 2024 annual letter, he noted that all five companies had agreed to relax the previously agreed-upon 10% ownership ceiling. At the recent annual meeting, Buffett said he "won't give a thought" to selling them and expects Berkshire to own them for fifty years or more. Berkshire now owns around 10% of each of these trading companies. Interestingly, Buffett mitigated the foreign exchange risk associated with these companies being traded in Japanese Yen by having Berkshire Hathaway issue Yen-denominated bonds, thereby better currency-matching assets and liabilities. While individual investors can't issue foreign-currency-denominated bonds, currency-hedged investments are available to mitigate currency risk. For example, WisdomTree Japan Hedged Equity ETF (DXJ) provides exposure to dividend-paying Japanese stocks, currently including most of Buffett's Japanese trading houses, while hedging the currency to remove as much of the Yen-currency risk as possible. Alternatively, a non-currency-hedged individual foreign stock position can be perfectly reasonable if it presents an attractive opportunity, even when considering the currency, political, legal, and regulatory risks of the country.

I am a long-time shareholder of Berkshire Hathaway and worked for Salomon Brothers when Warren Buffett became Chairman and CEO.

Title: Stablecoins on the march: Government green light and AI drive growing enterprise interest in digital currency

UPDATED 23:51 EDT / OCTOBER 10 2025 by Mark Albertson A major shift in U.S. government sentiment toward cryptocurrencies combined with innovation from AI are making the stablecoin market an emerging force in the digital asset economy. Indeed, there is mounting evidence that crypto is having its “ChatGPT moment” and stablecoins are leading some of the largest companies in the world into programmable finance. Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc., X Corp., Airbnb Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Google LLC and Uber Technologies Inc. are all reportedly exploring the integration of stablecoins on their platforms. Ten major banks, including Bank of America and Deutsche Bank, are also investigating whether to issue stablecoins as part of their offerings. Stablecoins are digital assets pegged to the value of fiat currency, often the U.S. dollar. “It seems like everyone is launching a stablecoin,” said Amy Kalnoki, co-founder and chief operating officer of Bitwave Inc. “Investing in digital assets has gone mainstream. It’s no longer a question of whether enterprises will adopt digital assets, but when.” Kalnoki spoke Thursday at the BuildETH Conference in San Francisco, a gathering of leaders in the Ethereum decentralized blockchain community. She noted that stablecoin transfer volume now exceeds that of global credit issuers Visa and Mastercard, reaching $27 trillion last year. A major reason for the tailwind behind stablecoins is the emergence of a U.S. law establishing the first comprehensive regulatory framework for the fledgling currency. The Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins (GENIUS) Act was signed by President Donald Trump in July and reduced regulatory uncertainty for financial institutions, issuers and investors. The GENIUS Act, coupled with a “Project Crypto” initiative by the Securities and Exchange Commission to modernize rules and regulations that will enable crypto trading, have infused real financial power in the issuance and settlement of digital currencies, according to Gary Yang, founding partner at Eureka Finance. “The GENIUS Act and Project Crypto are redefining the rules of the financial game,” Yang told the BuildETH audience. “If everyone can print money, then you have to build up the pricing power of your money. This is what the GENIUS Act is doing.” Missing from this recent wave of regulatory permissiveness is the answer to a key question: How will consumers be able to use stablecoins as a ubiquitous currency if they are dependent on each issuer’s platform? This question of interoperability has not been resolved by the U.S. government, and it’s a prime topic of interest to those in the crypto world today. Amy Kolnaki of Bitwave described the growth of stablecoin adoption. “The key question is will stablecoins be interoperable or will they be siloed?” Kalnoki noted. “It is a really interesting time of how fractioned things are right now. It’s an interesting time to see who will win the stablecoin race.” The influence of AI in the crypto industry may push digital currency providers to build interoperable models for stablecoins. This is currently playing out as major players grapple with implementing a consistent payments standard, potentially using the x402 open protocol that has existed on the internet for decades. The x402 protocol is a “payment required” status code that sits on top of HTTP. Last month, Cloudflare Inc. and Coinbase Inc. launched the x402 Foundation to further the development of an open internet standard for payments. There is some urgency behind this initiative, as enterprises continue to adopt and implement AI agents. It’s expected that agents ultimately will shop, make buying decisions and execute payments on behalf of users. The x402 standard, along with the Agents Payment Protocol or AP2 under development by Google, provide early looks at how AI will automate consumer purchases. Kevin Leffew of Coinbase highlighted enterprise interest in the x402 standard. “The goal for x402 is to be something analogous to Kubernetes,” Kevin Leffew, go-to-market lead for the Coinbase Developer Platform, told the BuildETH gathering. “It’s driving value across platforms.” For the x402 standard to succeed as the agentic payment protocol, it has to be fast. This is not a simple problem to solve inside the crypto world which was built on the often-cumbersome application of per transaction settlement fees called “gas.” At the software company Edge & Node, developers are working on an enhancement for x402 that will allow for deferred payment schemes via signed vouchers that reduce gas costs and settle micropayments on-chain. The company previously built the Graph infrastructure for indexing on-chain data and views the agent payment protocol as a significant next step. “Trillions of dollars will flow agent to agent,” according to Edge & Node CEO Rodrigo Coelho. “We’ve got to surf this wave rather than being inundated by it.” The current momentum behind stablecoins and the crypto world has also brought renewed scrutiny on the industry’s privacy and security. If the floodgates open for agentic payments in decentralized finance, there is also a risk that users will end up disclosing far more than they bargained for. The blockchain uses a “mempool,” a public queue of unconfirmed transactions waiting in line for addition to the next available block. Malicious actors can exploit this process, known as a MEV or Maximal Extractable Value exploit, by remining blocks for theft or leveraging the visibility and force victims to sell at a lower price. Losses in this category are beginning to pile up. There have been reports that Coinbase lost $300,000 to MEV bots in August, and one user was victimized by a MEV exploit for $1 million in stablecoin last month. SKALE Labs Inc. has developed a BITE Protocol designed to encrypt blockchain transaction details before they are sent to the chain. It’s what co-founder and CEO Jack O’Holleran called passing the “Barista Test.” You want to buy coffee from your friendly barista, but you don’t want to expose all of your financial details in the process. “There’s so much innovation happening, but at some point you’ve got to deliver and reach the masses,” O’Holleran explained. “You are going to have a lot of robot baristas. We need to live in a world where you can buy things with stablecoins and not expose what you own.” Social engineering attacks and inadvertent disclosure of private keys have also exposed new vulnerabilities in the crypto world. That was reinforced in February when alleged hackers from North Korea stole $1.5 billion from an Ethereum wallet controlled by Bybit Technology Ltd., an exploit believed to be the largest cryptocurrency heist to date. Yevheniia Broshevan of Hacken outlined security risks confronting the crypto world. “Getting access to private keys is something we keep seeing over and over,” said Yevheniia Broshevan, co-founder and CEO of Hacken. “Be really cautious what you are clicking and who it is coming from.” Despite setbacks and ongoing risk in the cryptocurrency market, enthusiasm for stablecoins and mainstream growth in decentralized finance continues to grow. The optimism is fueled by a desire to become a force in “forex” or the foreign exchange market, which has a daily trading volume of $9.6 trillion and a total value range of $3.4 quadrillion to $3.9 quadrillion. By any measure, that’s real money. “The foreign exchange market is ultimately the only market these stablecoins are going after,” said Matthew Chruscielski, ecosystem lead at ZetaChain Inc. “Who wouldn’t want to be a part of $3.9 quadrillion?” Support our mission to keep content open and free by engaging with theCUBE community.

Title: Here’s How High The XRP Price Would Be With The Market Cap Of Bitcoin

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. Among all the cryptocurrencies in the industry, few have seen as many comments and predictions as XRP. Once trapped under legal uncertainty, XRP has begun to reclaim attention thanks to favorable legal developments and the anticipated launch of Spot XRP ETFs. However, XRP’s current valuation is significantly below that of the largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. But what if XRP were to rise to the same market capitalization as Bitcoin? Data from MarketCapOf offers a glimpse into how much each XRP token would be worth if it reached Bitcoin’s current market cap. Bitcoin’s market capitalization has reached heights that rival and even surpass some of the world’s largest multinational corporations. Notably, Bitcoin’s current market cap of $2.415 trillion places it shoulder to shoulder with tech giants like Apple and Microsoft. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is the eighth-biggest asset by market cap, just behind Silver and Amazon, and well ahead of Meta Platforms, Broadcom, and Saudi Aramco. XRP is currently the third biggest cryptocurrency in terms of market cap, but its market cap is far below Bitcoin’s lead. However, many analysts and market commentators believe XRP stands out as one of the few assets capable of challenging Bitcoin’s dominance. This belief originates from XRP’s alignment with traditional finance. Its established partnerships with banks and payment providers give it a practical use case that most cryptocurrencies do not have. At the time of writing, XRP has a market cap of $168 billion, not even up to one-tenth of Bitcoin’s market cap. According to MarketCapOf, if XRP were to reach Bitcoin’s current market cap, each token would be worth approximately $40.68. Given XRP’s circulating supply of about 53.4 billion tokens, this price prediction represents an increase of over 14,000% or 14.35x, from its current level of around $2.8. In practical terms, an early investor holding just 1,000 XRP today would see their holdings valued at more than $40,000 under this scenario. The comparison provides a valuable perspective on XRP’s long-term potential and the scale of value transfer possible within the crypto market. It also shows how far XRP needs to go in order to reach Bitcoin’s current level. Bitcoin’s dominance today is due to its first-mover advantage and its acceptance as a store of value. However, XRP is growing in remittances and real-world asset tokenization, and Ripple’s stakeholders are working to challenge SWIFT. This gives the cryptocurrency a utility foundation that could cause the growth of its market share. If Ripple continues to secure partnerships with central banks, payment providers, and institutional investors, as Ripple has increasingly done in regions like the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and Latin America, then the idea of XRP closing even a fraction of the gap with Bitcoin becomes less far-fetched. At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $2.83. Another factor that could contribute to this projected price growth is if Spot XRP ETFs are launched in the US and they perform well.

Title: Ceasefire Working

Israel Liz Wolfe | 10.10.2025 9:30 AM Israeli troops retreating: The ceasefire came into effect at noon local time in Gaza, and Israeli forces stopped their advances, repositioning themselves according to the demarcated lines. Israel's cabinet convened and signed off on the deal early this morning, which starts the 72-hour clock for Hamas to release all hostages. Per the deal, 250 Palestinian prisoners will be released from Israeli jails in exchange. The U.S. will reportedly send 200 troops to the Middle East—possibly not directly into Gaza, but adjacent to it—to monitor the ceasefire's implementation; soldiers from Egypt, Qatar, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates will also be involved in monitoring the situation. The Reason Roundup Newsletter by Liz Wolfe Liz and Reason help you make sense of the day's news every morning. Meanwhile, "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has publicly implied for the first time that not all the deceased hostages held captive in Gaza will return," reports CNN. "In a televised address, Netanyahu said that Israel will work to locate all of the dead hostages in Gaza 'as soon as possible,' underscoring previous assessments that Hamas may not be able to find and return all of their remains." Twenty-eight hostages are believed to be dead, while 20 are still living; Netanyahu has long conditioned the ceasefire on the total return of all hostages. "We will bring the deceased hostages to burial in Israel," Netanyahu reminded the Israeli people. "We will work to locate all of them as soon as possible, and we will fulfill this as a sacred duty of mutual responsibility." Disarmament is still being negotiated, and there's still the disheartening possibility that further negotiations will be snarled. But so far, early news from the region is very promising. Letitia James indicted in mortgage fraud case: New York Attorney General Letitia James was indicted by the Department of Justice, seemingly directed specifically to pursue this case by President Donald Trump, on charges that she committed one count of bank fraud and one count of making false statements to a financial institution when buying a home in Norfolk, Virginia. "The indictment accuses Ms. James of violating a mortgage agreement on a Virginia house she purchased in 2020 by using it as a rental property," reports The New York Times, but James' lawyer says his client "flatly and forcefully denies these charges" and that the case is instead "driven by President Trump's desire for revenge." Some evidence has emerged that James did, in fact, receive favorable terms on her loan that let her save just under $20,000 over the full life of the loan. (It's not clear that James does rent the property out: Someone familiar with her situation told The New York Times that the property is just occupied by family members who have no lease.) You're not mistaken in thinking this is evocative of the civil fraud case James brought against Trump, and also of the accusations levied against Federal Reserve Board Chair Lisa Cook. This is the predictable outcome of lawfare: races to the bottom, to dig up as much dirt as possible on one's enemies, and to waste as much time and money as possible litigating it all instead of doing more valuable law-enforcement work. (This applies whether it's this case against James or her civil fraud case against Trump, to be clear.) Everything's TV: "A spooky convergence is happening in media," writes Derek Thompson on his Substack. "Everything that is not already television is turning into television." Nowadays, "only a small share of time spent on its social-networking platforms is truly 'social' networking—that is, time spent checking in with friends and family. More than 80 percent of time spent on Facebook and more than 90 percent of time spent on Instagram is spent watching videos, the company reported. Most of that time is spent watching content from creators whom the user does not know." Ditto for podcasts—formerly basically radio—shifting to YouTube; everything's TV now. Same with Sora and Vibes, new artificial intelligence tools from OpenAI and Meta, respectively; everything's TV. So why is this a problem? TV isn't inherently bad, per se. "Television speaks to us in a particular dialect, [Neil] Postman argued," continues Thompson. "When everything turns into television, every form of communication starts to adopt television's values: immediacy, emotion, spectacle, brevity." This extends to, and warps, our politics: "The right-wing president is a reality-TV star. The most exciting new voice on the left is a straight-to-camera savant. Mastering the grammar of television—especially short-form television—does not feel secondary to political success in America; it is political success in America." Isn't this literally the world described in Harrison Bergeron? The TV always on, the mental-handicap radio zapping the father's head so he can't complete a thought. pic.twitter.com/W9HQS9cved — Liz Wolfe (@LizWolfeReason) October 10, 2025 I'll level with you: I don't like the great convergence, in which many forms of media become TV. I don't like the hit to our attention spans. I don't like people's inability to sit with their own thoughts. I don't like the fact that proportionality is lost when everything is portrayed as urgent and important. I don't like the algorithm-driven attempts to jockey for my attention via ALL-CAPS in headlines and obnoxiously expressive thumbnails and a constant stream of emotive language. And, mostly, I'm worried about what habits will be developed by generations who are raised on TV slop, whose attention spans are not safeguarded, and whose critical thinking skills were never given a chance to form.

Title: Is Oracle Or Palantir The Smarter AI Stock To Buy?

ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. Oracle focuses mostly on database software, where it is a leader, and data centers. The company's potential stock upside may be higher.Palantir’s strategy is dispersed across more market segments, making its growth prospects much higher.Oracle may be the better bet given its superior risk return. Although risk-loving traders may try to ride the Palantir rollercoaster. OpenAI and Nvidia get most of the headlines around artificial intelligence, but there are many other company's stocks that investors could trade to profit from the AI boom. How so? Companies in the AI cloud services and AI-powered applications software sectors – along with providers of hardware and power for AI data centers – present compelling opportunities. For example, is AI cloud-services provider Oracle or AI-powered data analytics company Palantir a better investment? Oracle may be the better bet given its superior risk return. Although risk-loving traders may try to ride the Palantir rollercoaster. Read on for a comparison of the companies’ AI business strategies, growth trajectories, financials, valuation and investor sentiment. Oracle Cloud Infrastructure’s partnerships drive the company’s AI strategy. Although Oracle is the fifth largest global provider of cloud infrastructure, with about 4% share, OCI is growing faster than its larger rivals, such as AWS (31% market share), Microsoft Azure (22%) and Google Cloud (12%). OCI’s growth has benefited from Oracle’s partnerships with leading AI chatbot providers and the chipmaker Nvidia. Partnerships include OpenAI, xAI (Elon Musk's AI company), and Meta, according to Oracle’s most recent earnings call transcript. Oracle also benefited from its rivals’ use of its database software. For instance, AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud use Oracle’s multi-cloud database – yielding 1,529% growth in the company’s first-quarter fiscal 2026 report by deploying “34 cloud regions inside competitor platforms,” Oracle founder and chief technology officer Larry Ellison said in a company release. Palantir operates in various market segments, including data analytics, AI platforms and mission-critical decision systems. The company enjoys a competitive advantage from decades selling to the U.S. government, and Palantir’s success launching AI platforms quickly and effectively. For instance, Palantir has spent more than 20 years working with the Department of Defense, Central Intelligence Agency and the U.S. Army. Moreover, the company’s rapid deployment of its AIP — fewer than “two months from bootcamp to production,” according to Futurum Group — has helped Palantir win new contracts. Palantir’s value for customers is reflected in the company’s 128% net-dollar retention rate, indicating strong upselling to existing customers, according to Yahoo! Finance. Customer success stories“include "Cleveland Clinic reducing ER wait times by 38 minutes and Tampa General Hospital shortening sepsis patient stays by 15%,” according to a Palantir investor update. Oracle’s business strategy, financial performance and prospects, and the stock's upside differ significantly from Palantir’s. Oracle focuses mostly on database software – where it is a clear leader – and data centers, and the company's potential stock upside may be higher. Palantir’s strategy is dispersed across more market segments, making its growth prospects much higher. However, Palantir’s stock risks falling: The company has a very high valuation and growth is expected to slowdown. Oracle supplies products mostly for enterprises, while Palantir’s services are more specialized and mostly aimed at governments. Oracle’s services included OCI, enterprise applications — enterprise resource management, human capital management and customer relationship management — as well as database services. Oracle sells to companies of all sizes in many vertical markets and works extensively with partners and other resellers. Palantir supplies more specialized services, including data integration, analytics and an AI platform. While it's expanding its commercial footprint, Palantir has mostly worked with governments, which accounted for more than half the company’s revenue last year. Oracle is growing more slowly, has greater potential for revenue acceleration and has been more consistently profitable. Palantir is growing faster, could suffer a slowdown and first became profitable as recently as the fourth quarter of 2022, Reuters reported. Oracle’s growth rate has accelerated in the last four quarters. The company’s OCI unit grew faster than rival cloud services providers, and the company has a significant backlog. For example, Oracle’s revenue growth increased from 7% to 12% between the third quarter of fiscal 2024 and the first quarter of FY 2026, when the company earned a 19.6% net margin. In first-quarter 2026, OCI revenue increased about 53% – faster than AWS (18%) and Microsoft Azure (about 24%). Most impressively, Oracle’s Remaining Performance Obligations backlog in September 2025 soared 359% to $455 billion, as I wrote last month on Forbes. Palantir grew faster, however analysts expect the company’s growth to decelerate below management’s projections. Between Q2 2024 and Q2 2025, Palantir’s revenue growth went from 27% to 48%. In the most recent quarter, Palantir’s net margin was 32.5%, up from 24% in the first quarter of 2025. However, Palantir’s growth appears to be slowing down. Management projects 45% growth for 2025, according to a company release, although analysts forecast growth moderating to between 25% and 45% in 2026, Simply Wall Street reported. Palantir has a higher valuation than Oracle and analysts see greater downside risk to holding Palantir stock. Oracle trades at a price-to-sales ratio which is roughly equal to the enterprise software industry average of 8 to 12. Given Oracle’s significant revenue backlog in its OCI unit, the company's valuation could be considered low, TradingView noted. Palantir’s price-to-sales ratio was 127 on Oct. 6 – nearly seven times more than rival Snowflake’s P/S ratio of 19. Both Oracle and Palantir face significant risks. Oracle’s worries include large capital expenditures to supply OCI demand and intense rivalry. Palantir’s high valuation would mean any execution failure could sink its stock. While Wall Street maintains 74% "Buy" ratings on Oracle because of its high valuation, analysts are more skeptical of Palantir despite its superior operational performance. Consensus ratings on Palantir show "Hold" with between 60% and 65% of analysts neutral, according to TipRanks. Palantir stock is 9% overvalued according to TipRanks, which sets an average price target of $165. Oracle’s price target of $341 suggests the stock has 19% upside. If you have a big appetite for risk, go with Palantir. If you are looking for relatively predictable growth at a reasonable price, consider buying Oracle stock. Analysts have more confidence in Oracle’s upside because it has a more reasonable valuation and a large backlog of future OCI orders. By contrast, analysts see growth slowing for Palantir, making its eye-popping valuation hard to justify. Of course, if Palantir keeps beating and raising, the stock will pop.

Title: Tesla package pays Musk billions even if he misses goals

When Tesla's board of directors offered Elon Musk the biggest executive pay package in corporate history in September, it reassured investors that he would have to achieve the equivalent of "Mars-shot milestones" to earn $878 billion in Tesla stock over 10 years. The board's proposal said Musk would have to "completely transform Tesla and society as we know it" in robotics and autonomous driving as well as stock value and profits. Conversely, Musk would get "zero" unless he meets those "incredibly ambitious" goals. Yet Musk could reap tens of billions of dollars without meeting most of those targets, according to a Reuters analysis of his performance goals and more than a dozen experts in executive pay, company valuations, robotics and automotive trends including autonomous driving. He could collect more than $50 billion by hitting a handful of the board's easier goals that will not necessarily revolutionise Tesla’s products or business, the Reuters review found. Even hitting just two of the easiest targets, along with modest stock growth, would net Musk $26 billion, more than the lifetime pay of the next eight best-paid CEOs combined, a group that includes Meta Platforms' Mark Zuckerberg, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, Apple's Tim Cook, and Nvidia's Jensen Huang, according to an analysis for Reuters by research firm Equilar. Musk's vehicle sales goals are exceptionally easy to achieve, according to four automotive experts. If Musk sells 1.2 million cars a year over the next decade, on average, he earns $8.2 billion in stock if Tesla’s market value grows from $1.4 trillion today to $2 trillion in 2035, well under long-term market-average growth. That is a half-million fewer cars per year than Tesla sold in 2024. Tesla earlier this week unveiled lower-cost versions of its best-selling Model Y SUV and Model 3 sedan to reverse falling sales. Three other product-development goals are written in vague language that could provide Musk hefty payouts without significantly boosting profit, according to six robotics or autonomous-driving industry experts who reviewed Musk’s goals for Reuters. In a statement, a spokesperson for the Tesla board said: "The proposed pay package is actually worth zero to our CEO unless and until the shareholders see the value of the company nearly double and an operational milestone is met." The board’s pay proposal requires Musk to remain a Tesla executive for at least seven and a half years to collect any stock compensation. Musk, however, would get the voting rights associated with the share awards as soon as he earns them. Musk said last month on his social media platform X that the package is "not about 'compensation' but about me having enough influence over Tesla to ensure safety if we build millions of robots." In its proposal, the board said Musk is "motivated by more than just conventional forms of compensation." Self driving cars, robotaxis and robotics Each goal grants Musk 1% of Tesla stock if he also reaches valuation milestones between $2 trillion and $8.5 trillion. One goal requires 10 million subscriptions to Tesla's "Full Self-Driving" (FSD) software, which can’t currently drive itself without human intervention. The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said yesterday it is opening an investigation into 2.88 million FSD-equipped Tesla vehicles over more than 50 reports of traffic-safety violations and a series of crashes. Musk's performance goal contains no requirement that Tesla make FSD fully autonomous, instead requiring only an "advanced driving system". That is a "made-up term" with no industry-standard definition, said William Widen, a University of Miami law professor specialising in autonomous driving. Autonomous-driving experts say the subscription target might be easily met by dropping the price, currently $8,000 upfront or $99 a month. Tesla's leading electric-vehicle rival, China’s BYD, already offers a similar system for free. "If I were Musk’s personal employment lawyer, I would like these definitions," said Matthew Wansley, a professor at New York’s Cardozo School of Law who focuses on autonomous driving. Another goal requires one million robotaxis in commercial operation and specifies cars "without a human driver in the vehicle." That is a potentially more restrictive definition but four autonomous-vehicle experts said it could be interpreted to allow for humans controlling vehicles remotely or from the passenger seat - as Tesla does now in its first small-scale robotaxi test in Austin, Texas. Musk's employment deal also sets a target of one million robots, an apparent reference to the Optimus humanoid robots Musk has long promised. But the goal does not specify "humanoid" and could be interpreted broadly, two robotics-industry experts said. It defines "bot" as "any robot or other physical product with mobility using artificial intelligence." "It’s a totally vague formulation," said Christian Rokseth, an analyst with market research firm Humanoid.guide specialising in robotics and artificial intelligence. Investors, he said, are expecting a humanoid robot. Modest targets worth billions Hitting any two product goals in a decade, along with a $2.5 trillion valuation, pays Musk $26.4 billion in stock. Hitting three targets and a $3 trillion valuation pays him $54.6 billion. That means Musk could earn these amounts without delivering driverless Teslas, the signature product he has promised for a decade. Gene Munster, managing partner at Tesla investor Deepwater Asset Management, said that despite the loose language in his performance agreement, investors would ultimately hold him accountable for delivering transformational products. "If people start smelling there's something goofy here, he's in trouble," Munster said. In its pay proposal, Tesla's board declared Musk the only person capable of transforming Tesla into an artificial-intelligence juggernaut. The board added that Musk, during negotiations, raised the prospect of "prioritising other ventures" if he and the board could not agree on compensation. Corporate governance experts said the board is taking a huge risk by so explicitly staking its future on one leader. Wei Jiang, vice dean at Emory University’s business school, said Tesla's board has granted Musk a "monopoly" on its top job. Good corporate governance, she said, requires embracing a "competitive and fluid market for CEOs." The hard part - profits Musk's hardest performance targets are likely those involving profit, a measure with no room for interpretation. The directors set eight profit goals between $50 billion and $400 billion in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, compared to Tesla's 2024 earnings of $16.6 billion. Tesla's EV business, which accounts for almost all its revenue, is deteriorating with aging models facing fierce competition. Its only newer model, the Cybertruck, has flopped. The way Musk's compensation is structured, however, allows for massive payouts without hitting any profit target. Every goal combined with a market-value increase offers the same 1% stock payout. So Musk gets the same pay for meeting the relatively easy vehicle sales and FSD-subscription goals, for instance, as he would for boosting earnings five-fold to $80 billion. The board's valuation goals may prove far easier than its profit targets. Tesla's value could hit $2 trillion, for instance, if shares grow a modest 6.4% annually over the decade following the board's September 3 pay-package approval. That is slower growth than the S&P 500’s 8.5% annual average over the past 30 years and less than half the Nasdaq’s 13.2% average. Seth Goldstein, a Morningstar analyst who tracks Tesla, said its valuation could easily hit $3 trillion or more over a decade with market-average performance. He pointed out, however, that Tesla's value is already largely based on "future products that don’t exist today." For Musk to claim the biggest payouts offered by Tesla’s board, Goldstein said, "we’re going to start having to see real products." Kevin Murphy, a University of Southern California finance professor and an expert witness for Tesla in defending Musk’s 2018 pay package, acknowledged that the vehicle sales and $2 trillion valuation goals are not "much of a stretch" but simply reaching those will not appease shareholders. Neither will the "handful of billions" for lower-rung goals matter much to Musk, who cares more about historic technological achievements, Murphy said. Shareholders, he said, have focused on the hardest goals and biggest payouts because they believe Musk - and only Musk - can hit them. "Is it worth it?" Murphy said. "Shareholders seem to think so."

Title: Time Bomb: How Uninsured Stablecoins and Crypto Derivatives Threaten Financial and Economic Stability

Please join us and participate via our donation page, which shows how to give via check, credit card, debit card, PayPal, Clover, or Wise. Read about why we’re doing this fundraiser,what we’ve accomplished in the last year, and our current goal, original reporting Yves here. In our post on the high odds of an eventual AI stock bubble collapse, we pointed out that debt or dollar distress could, as happened in 1987, set off a stock market unraveling. We were remiss in that post in not pointing out how runs on stablecoins and collapses in the value of stablecoin derivatives could in and of themselves trigger a crisis, or trigger a series of financial asset value plunges. This article helps remedy that lapse. By Arthur E. Wilmarth, Professor Emeritus of Law, George Washington University. Originally published at the Institute of New Economic Thinking website The GENIUS Act is a disastrous law that poses grave and unacceptable threats to our financial and economic future. Congress must remove those threats by (1) repealing the GENIUS Act and passing legislation that requires all stablecoin providers to be FDIC-insured banks, and (2) adopting legislation that requires all crypto derivatives to comply with the rules governing non-digital derivatives under Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act. On July 18, 2025, the President Trump signed into law the ‘‘Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins Act” (GENIUS Act). The GENIUS Act – despite its Orwellian sobriquet – is a profoundly misguided lawthat creates enormous dangers for our financial system, economy, and society. The GENIUS Act authorizes nonbanks to issue uninsured stablecoins to the public without the essential safeguards provided by federal deposit insurance and the prudential regulations governing FDIC-insured banks. In addition, the GENIUS Act gives federal and state regulators broad authority to allow nonbank stablecoin issuers to sell highly-leveraged crypto derivatives and other speculative crypto investments to the public. As shown below, the GENIUS Act plants the seeds for a crypto-fueled “Subprime 2.0” financial crisis that could be even worse than the global financial crisis of 2007-09. The GENIUS Act places the federal government’s seal of approval on uninsured and weakly-regulated nonbank stablecoins as well as hazardous crypto derivatives. By doing so, the GENIUS Act has greatly increased the likelihood that future runs on stablecoins and fire sales of crypto derivativeswill trigger systemic crises in our financial markets that have devastating spillover effects on our economy. The GENIUS Act also opens the door for Big Tech firms and other commercial enterprises to issue and distribute stablecoins and conduct a crypto-based banking business. Allowing commercial and technology giants to offer stablecoins and other risky crypto investments will greatly increase the risk that future crypto crashes will engulf our entire economy. In view of the federal government’s massive debt burden and rapidly rising debt service costs, it is extremely doubtful whether federal agencies could arrange another set of comprehensive bailouts without triggering a sovereign debt crisis. To remove the intolerable threats posed by uninsured nonbank stablecoins and crypto derivatives, Congress should repeal the GENIUS Act and pass legislation requiring all issuers and distributors of stablecoins to be FDIC-insured banks. Congress should also pass legislation requiring crypto derivatives to comply with the prudential rules established by Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act for non-digital derivatives. Uninsured Nonbank Stablecoins Are Highly Vulnerable to Investor Runs, Which the GENIUS Act Will ot prevent A stablecoin is a crypto-asset whose issuer represents that the stablecoin’s value will maintain parity with a designated fiat currency or some other referenced asset or group of assets. About 98% of global stablecoins are linked (“pegged”) to the U.S. dollar. Dollar-linked stablecoins are functionally equivalent to bank deposits because their issuers represent that their stablecoins will be redeemed or transferred to third parties, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, on their holders’ demand or within a specified time. The global stablecoin market is highly concentrated. Tether’s USDT and Circle’s USDC account for over 80% of the $300 billion market capitalization of all global stablecoins. Stablecoins are primarily used as payment instruments for speculating in crypto-assets with fluctuating values, with about 90% of stablecoin payments being linked to crypto trades. Stablecoins are also widely used for conducting illicit transactions. In 2023, stablecoins were used as payment instruments for 60% of unlawful cryptocurrency transactions (including crypto scams, ransomware, evasion of capital controls, money laundering, and tax evasion) and 80% of all cryptocurrency transactions conducted by sanctioned regimes and terrorist groups. Dollar-linked stablecoins are used to a limited extent for cross-border remittances and other types of conventional payments, especially in developing countries with high inflation rates, unstable currencies, and unreliable banking and payment systems. In those countries, dollar-linked stablecoins provide a more stable form of currency, a more secure form of payment, and a hedge against inflation. At present, however, only 6% of stablecoin transactions involve cross-border remittances and other types of conventional payments. In addition, some governments view dollar-linked stablecoins as a threat to their monetary sovereignty and are considering measures to ban or limit the use of dollar-linked stablecoins in their countries. Despite the promises made by stablecoin issuers, stablecoins have proven to be anything but stable. More than 20 stablecoins collapsed between 2016 and 2022, and every leading global stablecoin – including USDT and USDC – lost its “peg” on multiple occasions between 2019 and 2023. Nonbank stablecoins are inherently unstable due to their primary use as “casino chips” for trading (gambling) in crypto-assets with fluctuating values. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other fluctuating-value crypto-assets have displayed huge price swings because they do not have any substantial underlying real-world assets, and they do not generate independent cash flows from activities beyond the speculative transactions occurring on their blockchains. Prices for crypto-assets with fluctuating values have experienced pronounced boom-and-bust cycles, including the crypto boom of 2020-21, the “crypto winter” of 2021-22, a slow recovery during 2022-23, and a second crypto boom that began in 2024, interrupted by a brief downturn during the first quarter of 2025. When values for crypto-assets fall significantly, highly-leveraged investors must liquidate their crypto holdings (including stablecoins) to meet margin calls and other debt obligations. The global market value of outstanding stablecoins dropped from $180 billion to $130 billion during the “crypto winter” of 2021-22, when the price of Bitcoin and the total market capitalization of all crypto-assets dropped by 70%. When large numbers of investors are suddenly obliged to liquidate their stablecoins, they must rely on the ability of stablecoin issuers and stablecoin exchanges to redeem stablecoins quickly at the “pegged” value of $1 per coin. The GENIUS Act permits nonbank stablecoin issuers to hold all or most of their reserves in uninsured financial instruments, such as uninsured bank deposits, money market funds (MMFs), and repurchase agreements (repos). Those uninsured reserves make nonbank stablecoin issuers vulnerable to serious disruptions in traditional financial markets. When Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) failed during the regional banking crisis of 2023, SVB’s largest uninsured depositor turned out to be Circle, which held $3.3 billion (8%) of USDC’s reserves at SVB. USDC broke its $1 “peg” after SVB failed, and its value fell to $0.87. USDC’s stablecoin holders launched a major run, and Circle was forced to liquidate $8 billion of its assets to satisfy redemption demands. USDC avoided a complete collapse – which could have caused a systemic meltdown in crypto markets – only after federal regulators invoked the systemic risk exception in the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and bailed out Circle and SVB’s other uninsured depositors. The federal government’s rescue of Circle represented the first government bailout of uninsured nonbank stablecoins. As SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw observed in April 2005, “there is always a risk, particularly in times of market stress or if the price of a stablecoin drops, of a ‘run’ scenario” where crypto exchanges and stablecoin issuers “cannot honor all redemption requests in real time,” triggering a “self-reinforcing cycle of redemptions and fire sales of reserve assets.” The runs that have already occurred on nonbank stablecoins resemble the runs on uninsured deposits, MMFs, repos, and other uninsured, short-term financial claims that have taken place during U.S. financial crises stretching from the nineteenth century through 2023. The federal government rescued uninsured depositors in 1980-92, 2008-09, and 2023 to prevent banking and financial crises from becoming full-blown economic depressions. For similar reasons, the federal government protected investors in MMFs and other uninsured short-term financial instruments (such as commercial paper and repos) during the global financial crisis of 2008-09 and the pandemic financial crisis of 2020-21. The foregoing crises demonstrate that uninsured nonbank stablecoins, like other uninsured, short-term financial claims, are highly vulnerable to investor runs whenever there are substantial doubts about the ability of obligors to repay those financial claims in a timely manner. The GENIUS Act ignores the lessons of history because (1) it establishes a very weak and woefully inadequate regulatory regime for stablecoins, (2) it fails to provide a federally-supervised insurance fund or a federally-authorized lender of last resort to ensure the timely repayment of stablecoins, and (3) its only mechanism for dealing with defaults by stablecoin issuers is a deeply flawed bankruptcy regime, which will encourage stablecoin holders to run at the first sign of trouble. The GENIUS Act Will Not Improve Our Payments System or Increase Financial Inclusion Crypto advocates claim that uninsured nonbank stablecoins will greatly improve the U.S. payments system and increase financial inclusion. In fact, nonbank stablecoins operating on permissionless public blockchains do not offer a viable technology for providing fast, reliable, and cost-effective general-purpose payments or other large-volume financial services. Permissionless public blockchains suffer from two major problems – lack of scalability (the inability to process large numbers of transactions quickly) and immutability (the inability to correct mistaken, fraudulent, and unauthorized transactions). Those two problems – which arise out of the basic tenets of public blockchains – prevent public blockchains from providing a feasible technology for high-volume financial services. To mitigate the scalability problem, public blockchains have used “Layer 2” strategies such as sidechains and off-chain processing. “Layer 2” strategies delegate responsibility for processing and validating transactions to designated groups, which transmit the results of their work to the public blockchain. Such delegations of responsibility to trusted parties cause public blockchains to resemble permissioned distributed ledgers, which are administered by banks, broker-dealers, clearing facilities, and other traditional financial institutions. When public blockchains change their operations to function like permissioned ledgers, they effectively become financial intermediaries, and there is no longer any possible justification for regulating them differently from traditional financial intermediaries. As SEC Commissioner Crenshaw pointed out in January 2024, “If [public blockchain] technology is so revolutionary, why do so many of its uses seem to revolve around recreating the existing financial system, except with less regulation, more opacity, fewer investor protections, and more risk?” In addition to their unsuitability for general-purpose payments, nonbank stablecoins have not shown any ability to increase financial inclusion. Stablecoin holders must open bank accounts to convert their fiat currency into stablecoins, and to convert their stablecoins back into fiat currency. Stablecoin holders must also have internet access and financial sophistication, which many “unbanked” households lack. The crypto industry’s past dealings with underserved communities have included widespread predatory practices, including fraudulent marketing of high-risk crypto-assetsand “crypto ATMs” that charge high fees and are widely used to promote crypto scams. If Congress truly wants to promote a faster, cheaper, and more inclusive payments system, Congress should pass legislation that would (i) support tokenization of deposits on permissioned distributed ledgers administered by FDIC-insured banks, (ii) encourage faster implementation of real-time settlement services for bank payments, and (iii) require FDIC-insured banks to provide low-cost “Bank On” deposit accounts with payment services to lower-income individuals and families who satisfy minimum qualifications for lawful status and financial responsibility. Such legislation would promote much-needed improvements in our payments system and increase financial inclusion without undermining the integrity and effectiveness of our federally-insured banking system. The GENIUS Act Creates a “Shadow Banking 2.0” Crypto Regime and Unleashes Crypto Derivatives That Will Inflate a “Subprime 2.0” Crypto Bubble. The GENIUS Act allows uninsured nonbank stablecoins to become a dangerous new form of “shadow deposits” comparable to MMFs, thereby creating a dangerous “Shadow Banking 2.0” crypto regime. Nonbank stablecoin issuers will siphon away large amounts of deposits from FDIC-insured banks because the GENIUS Act permits affiliates of stablecoin issuers and crypto exchanges to pay “rewards” on stablecoins. The loss of bank deposits will severely impair the ability of community and regional banks to provide much-needed loans to consumers and Main Street businesses. Nonbank stablecoin issuers cannot replace those lost loans because they must invest virtually all their assets in designated short-term financial instruments held as reserves. The GENIUS Act also permits nonbank stablecoin issuers to sell to the public a potentially unlimited range of crypto derivatives and other crypto investments that are approved by federal and state regulators as being “incidental” to the activities of crypto asset service providers. Crypto derivatives – including futures, options, and swaps – account for about three-quarters of all crypto trading activity, and most crypto derivatives trades occur on unregulated foreign exchanges. Perpetual crypto futures contracts enable investors to make highly-leveraged, long-term bets on movements in crypto prices without owning the underlying crypto-assets. In addition, SEC has approved crypto exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the value of both individual and multiple crypto-assets. Crypto ETFs are rapidly proliferating, as are “crypto treasury companies” that invest in crypto-assets. The explosion of high-risk crypto derivatives and other risky crypto investments is inflating a “Subprime 2.0” crypto bubble by generating multiple, highly-leveraged bets on extremely volatile crypto-assets that do not have any underlying tangible assets or independent cash flows. The rapidly growing pile of speculative bets on crypto-assets resembles the toxic pyramid of bets on subprime mortgages, which financial giants created during the “Subprime 1.0” credit boom of the 2000s by issuing trillions of dollars of derivatives whose values depended on the performance of subprime mortgages. The collapse of the “Subprime 1.0” credit boom in 2007 unleashed a global financial crisis. The bursting of the speculative crypto bubble produced by “Shadow Banking 2.0” and “Subprime 2.0” will almost certainly cause a similar crash, with potentially devastating spillover effects on our financial system and economy. Federal agencies will be very hard-pressed to contain such a crash with bailouts comparable to those of 2008-09 and 2020-21. Given the federal government’s huge debt burden, implementing such bailouts would be likely to trigger a crisis in the Treasury bond market as well as a significant depreciation of the U.S. dollar. The GENIUS Act Opens the Door for Big Tech firms and Other Commercial Enterprises to Conduct a Crypto Banking Business, Magnifying the Risks of the Current Crypto Bubble Under the GENIUS Act, Big Tech firms and other commercial enterprises can acquire nonbank stablecoin issuers and use those issuers’ funds and services to establish crypto-based financial empires. Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Apple, Meta (Facebook), Walmart, and X are already developing plans to offer stablecoins. The GENIUS Act allows privately-held technology firms, like Elon Musk’s X, to acquire nonbank stablecoin issuers. The statute also permits the “Stablecoin Certification Review Committee,” chaired by Treasury Secretary Bessent, to authorize publicly-traded Big Tech firms and other commercial enterprises to acquire nonbank stablecoin issuers. The GENIUS Act undermines our nation’s long-established policy of separating banking and commerce and creates enormous risks for consumers and Main Street businesses. Allowing Big Tech firms to issue and distribute stablecoins will give technology giants access to their customers’ private financial data, including detailed information about their financial assets and spending patterns. That access will increase exponentially the ability of Big Tech firms to surveil, sell, and monetize their customers’ private information. Acquisitions of stablecoin issuers by Big Tech firms and other commercial enterprises will create a new category of “too-big-to-fail” financial giants. Those acquisitions will also greatly increase the likelihood that future crypto crashes will spread across the entire span of our economy, inflicting catastrophic losses on our financial system, economy, and society. Conclusion The GENIUS Act is a disastrous law that poses grave and unacceptable threats to our financial and economic future. Congress must remove those threats by (1) repealing the GENIUS Act and passing legislation that requires all stablecoin providers to be FDIC-insured banks, and (2) adopting legislation that requires all crypto derivatives to comply with the rules governing non-digital derivatives under Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act. Why make those FDIC insured, but not Money Market Funds? MMF are securities like mutual funds and are protected to some degree by the SIPC. “To some degree”…I know They brought up the all important FDIC for this BS. Why not FDIC insurance for money market funds, which are often offered by FDIC insured banks? The article isn’t asking for stablecoin and crypto to be protected by SIPC “to some degree” or something like SIPC. Why would they get the special FDIC treatment and not money market funds? Did you miss that money market funds ARE now insured up to $250,000 like bank deposits? I didn’t see that dollar amount in the article. It mentioned some times of not letting MMFs go bust, but didn’t specify that it was an FDIC gaurantee. Please be careful of the terminology: Money Market Deposit Accounts are insured to the usual FDIC levels, when offered through a bank – the MMDA just another deposit account. A Money Market *fund*, is a security and cannot be offered through a bank (though it can be sold by a bank’s broker-dealer subsidiary, but is held in a brokerage account) and is not insured under FDIC rules — depending on how it’s held, it would be insured against failure of the broker-dealer by SIPC insurance. The article and underlying articles imply that it’s going to be ok for a bank to issue *uninsured* stablecoins, and rightly points out the history lessons that are being ignored. I haven’t seen anything that implies that the FDIC is going to expand deposit insurance to stablecoin amounts held in a bank account. (Though bailouts of uninsured holdings at banks as a result of bank failure certainly seems to be the historical norm.) https://www.fdic.gov/resources/deposit-insurance/faq ” A Money Market *fund*, is a security and cannot be offered through a bank (though it can be sold by a bank’s broker-dealer subsidiary, but is held in a brokerage account) and is not insured under FDIC rules —” “The article and underlying articles imply that it’s going to be ok for a bank to issue *uninsured* stablecoins” The article is proposing legislation be passed which “requires all stablecoin providers to be FDIC-insured banks.” It’s not saying a subsidiary…as you say about money market funds. I never said they were FDIC insured. The 2008 program that insured them up to $250,000 was a Treasury program, not FDIC: https://www.nhregister.com/news/article/Money-market-fund-insurance-program-no-longer-in-11603673.php And that amount was chosen because it was the same amount as FDIC insurance. The discussion is whether stablecoins would be bailed out in a crisis. I loathe the idea but the precedent says they would be. Not that I am encouraging readers to bet on it, but given how freaked out the officialdom is about runs on banks and large shadow banks (and mutual funds have been demonstrated to be in that category), the odds favor a second bailout if anything were to go awry. In fact, it would be politically hard not to do so after the Silicon Valley Bank rescue of uninsured depositors. Another note re FDIC insurance: it isn’t operative in the case of fraud. See here for an example: https://www.cbsnews.com/news/5-charged-with-80m-trust-theft/ Connecting to this question, I understand that imposing regulations upon stablecoin operators similar to those applying on banks (including reserves, prudential management, etc) would help reduce the risk and quash many of the worst and riskiest practices, but (perhaps a stupid question) why on its own would a FDIC insurance prevent runs on stablecoins? Isn’t FDIC insurance capped? And by the way: “require FDIC-insured banks to provide low-cost “Bank On” deposit accounts with payment services to lower-income individuals and families who satisfy minimum qualifications for lawful status and financial responsibility.” Oh no, again a proposal that requires proving that one meets the “minimum qualifications”. What about a low-cost “Bank On” deposit account with payment services for everybody, no qualifications asked, no bureaucratic applications, no availability depending from one year to another on the vagaries of life? It’s supposed to be capped, but look what happened with the SVB and other bailouts a couple of years ago. If SICP “to some degree” or something like that is good enough for other risky assets, why isn’t that brought up as an option? FDIC protect crypto and not money market funds? There’s a reason I assume for not doing it for money market funds. But that is being skipped over in the request to do it for crypto. “Nonbank stablecoins are inherently unstable due to their primary use as “casino chips” for trading (gambling) in crypto-assets with fluctuating values. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other fluctuating-value crypto-assets have displayed huge price swings because they do not have any substantial underlying real-world assets, and they do not generate independent cash flows from activities beyond the speculative transactions occurring on their blockchains. Prices for crypto-assets with fluctuating values have experienced pronounced boom-and-bust cycles, including the crypto boom of 2020-21, the “crypto winter” of 2021-22, a slow recovery during 2022-23, and a second crypto boom that began in 2024, interrupted by a brief downturn during the first quarter of 2025. When values for crypto-assets fall significantly, highly-leveraged investors must liquidate their crypto holdings (including stablecoins) to meet margin calls and other debt obligations…” And why not make stock portfolios FDIC insured? FDIC was brought up specifically. The FDIC inspects bank portfolios and can assure compliance with regs, specifically having full backing of the stablecoins. They are also talking about having losses covered. Or are they not? I would rather have them outlawed but that horse has left the barn and is in the next county. We are now forced to look at what options are least bad. Losses for a stablecoin would be the same as “breaking the buck” in a money market fund, as in would imply the failure/insolvency of the fund. I agree with most of the points except classifying all crypto assets as risky. Spot crypto ETFs that actually hold the underlying asset without use of risky futures and other derivatives are relatively safe. So is holding a deflationary asset like Bitcoin, the digital equivalent of gold. It derives its value from the network of participants, much like gold. There’s no inherent industrial or practical use for it other than all participants agreeing to use it as a store of value. BlackRock does not describe its Bitcoin ETF as a spot EFT on its site as in as part of its official disclosures. So I am not sure your claims about “spot EFT” are as encompassing as you imply: https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/products/333011/ishares-bitcoin-trust The language merely says “get exposure” which is way short of proportional to any underlying coins held. All ETFs also show drift from NAV since they trade on market prices and not on NAV like mutual funds. It’s a 100% spot ETF. Their holdings are all BTC (804,308.99780) worth $97,491,540,311.23 with some negligible amounts of cash in USD, as of 9 Oct 2025. It’s shown under “Holdings” in the link you mentioned. 🚀 Your response is beside the point. That is not what its investor disclosures say. I see no evidence in the marketing materials that BlackRock is contractually obligated to operate this EFT as a “spot” ETF nor do they call it a spot ETF in their marketing materials. If that is correct (and you would expect BlackRock to say prominently if they were running the ETF as a “spot” ETF, it would be an important selling point) that means they can change how they run it any time they damned well please. You are encouraged to find the sections of the fund prospectus that prove me wrong. but I see nothing of the kind on a quick pass of major terms. The entire “stablecoin” (which, with apologies to Voltaire, are neither stable nor coins) industry reminds of little more than 19th century “wildcat banking” with some sparkly “tech” sprinkled on top to gull the rubes. So it goes … Various players are getting a pass for this nonsense (see pic below)…so these types will continue to create messes that others have to clean up: “more and more like home mortgage securitization at the peak of the housing bubble with its overlapping series of capital conveyor belts.” pic.twitter.com/ar9NiVUaXp I don’t see it as all that far-fetched that we could have a AI/stock market collapse in combination with a crypto and stable coin panic. Poor Trump-ian impulse control on the trade and/or geopolitical front would then be the icing on the gravy, generating simultaneous and intertwined economic, financial and political crises… No wonder that gold, the ultimate Fear-O-Meter, is exploding in price. In the words of the immortal Lou Gorman: “The sun will rise, the sun will set, and I will have lunch.” In Water Cooler (remember that?) Lambert used to link to Greed and Fear index. I really don’t understand why that, and e.g., the VIX (also on that page) seem so unconcerned right now, apart from a spike earlier this year… Between inflation (Best foods mayo $12 Qt) and uncertainty I expect this Xmas to be a disaster for retailers, those 750,000 Federal workers who have just been told they might not get their back pay are unlikely to splurge on Xmas. Or spend $ on anything that isn’t a necessity. One of the things I learned selling Real Estate was that uncertainty killed markets, prices and interest rates had an important impact, however it was uncertainty that mattered most. And not by a small amount. Its pretty surreal watching it all play out-having no dog in the fight aside from the possibility that we’ll pull a circa 1990 move by take your pick of South American countries that all thought by renaming their national currency, everything would be jake. That’s what is potentially going down, our national currency backed by bright and shiny new bupkis. Don’t the Silicon Valley crypto-bros have as their goal the functional abolition of the national currency ( dollar) altogether, and the replacement of the dollar with their own stable of crypto currencies? Don’t they want to destroy the dollar’s value ( and retro-steal the value of every dollar saved right up to destruction day-zero) the same way the Yeltsin team destroyed all the “old rubles” to retro-steal all the paid-for work which earned those rubles by vaporising the value of all those saved ” old rubles”? Or is my simple layman’s mind playing memory tricks on me? It seems to me I remember millions of old pensioners in Yeltsin-era Russia being wiped out by Clinton’s Yeltsin-evaporation of their “old rubles”. If my memory is correct, then my view that this is exactly why the Silicon crypto-bros are advancing their crypto plans might at least be given a caution-inducing thought or two.

Title: Musk’s Tesla package pays him billions even if he misses ‘Mars-shot’ goals

When Tesla’s board of directors offered Elon Musk the biggest executive pay package in corporate history in September, it reassured investors that he would have to achieve the equivalent of “Mars-shot milestones” to earn $878 billion in Tesla stock over 10 years. The board’s proposal said Musk would have to “completely transform Tesla and society as we know it” in robotics and autonomous driving as well as stock value and profits. Conversely, Musk would get “zero” unless he meets those “incredibly ambitious” goals. Yet Musk could reap tens of billions of dollars without meeting most of those targets, according to a Reuters analysis of his performance goals and more than a dozen experts in executive pay, company valuations, robotics and automotive trends including autonomous driving. He could collect more than $50 billion by hitting a handful of the board’s easier goals that won’t necessarily revolutionize Tesla’s products or business, the Reuters review found. Even hitting just two of the easiest targets, along with modest stock growth, would net Musk $26 billion, more than the lifetime pay of the next eight best-paid CEOs combined, a group that includes Meta Platforms’ Mark Zuckerberg, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, Apple’s Tim Cook, and Nvidia’s Jensen Huang, according to an analysis for Reuters by research firm Equilar. Musk’s vehicle sales goals are exceptionally easy to achieve, according to four automotive experts. If Musk sells 1.2 million cars a year over the next decade, on average, he earns $8.2 billion in stock if Tesla’s market value grows from $1.4 trillion today to $2 trillion in 2035, well under long-term market-average growth. That’s a half-million fewer cars per year than Tesla sold in 2024. On Tuesday, Tesla unveiled lower-cost versions of its best-selling Model Y SUV and Model 3 sedan to reverse falling sales. Three other product-development goals are written in vague language that could provide Musk hefty payouts without significantly boosting profit, according to six robotics or autonomous-driving industry experts who reviewed Musk’s goals for Reuters. Tesla and Musk did not respond to requests for comment. In a statement, a spokesperson for the Tesla board said: “The proposed pay package is actually worth zero to our CEO unless and until the shareholders see the value of the company nearly double and an operational milestone is met.” The board’s pay proposal requires Musk to remain a Tesla executive for at least seven-and-a-half years to collect any stock compensation. Musk, however, would get the voting rights associated with the share awards as soon as he earns them. Musk said last month on his social media platform X that the package is “not about ‘compensation,’ but about me having enough influence over Tesla to ensure safety if we build millions of robots.” In its proposal, the board said Musk is “motivated by more than just conventional forms of compensation.” Each goal grants Musk 1% of Tesla stock if he also reaches valuation milestones between $2 trillion and $8.5 trillion. One goal requires 10 million subscriptions to Tesla’s “Full Self-Driving” (FSD) software, which can’t currently drive itself without human intervention. The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Thursday it is opening an investigation into 2.88 million FSD-equipped Tesla vehicles over more than 50 reports of traffic-safety violations and a series of crashes. Musk’s performance goal contains no requirement that Tesla make FSD fully autonomous, instead requiring only an “advanced driving system.” That’s a “made-up term” with no industry-standard definition, said William Widen, a University of Miami law professor specializing in autonomous driving. Autonomous-driving experts say the subscription target might be easily met by dropping the price, currently $8,000 upfront or $99 a month. Tesla’s leading electric-vehicle rival, China’s BYD, already offers a similar system for free. “If I were Musk’s personal employment lawyer, I would like these definitions,” said Matthew Wansley, a professor at New York’s Cardozo School of Law who focuses on autonomous driving. Another goal requires one million robotaxis in commercial operation and specifies cars “without a human driver in the vehicle.” That’s a potentially more restrictive definition but four autonomous-vehicle experts said it could be interpreted to allow for humans controlling vehicles remotely or from the passenger seat – as Tesla does now in its first small-scale robotaxi test in Austin, Texas. Musk’s employment deal also sets a target of one million robots, an apparent reference to the Optimus humanoid robots Musk has long promised. But the goal doesn’t specify “humanoid” and could be interpreted broadly, two robotics-industry experts said. It defines “bot” as “any robot or other physical product with mobility using artificial intelligence.” “It’s a totally vague formulation,” said Christian Rokseth, an analyst with market research firm Humanoid.guide specializing in robotics and artificial intelligence. Investors, he said, are expecting a humanoid robot. Hitting any two product goals in a decade, along with a $2.5 trillion valuation, pays Musk $26.4 billion in stock. Hitting three targets and a $3 trillion valuation pays him $54.6 billion. That means Musk could earn these amounts without delivering driverless Teslas, the signature product he’s promised for a decade. Gene Munster, managing partner at Tesla investor Deepwater Asset Management, said that despite the loose language in his performance agreement, investors would ultimately hold him accountable for delivering transformational products. “If people start smelling there’s something goofy here, he’s in trouble,” Munster said. In its pay proposal, Tesla’s board declared Musk the only person capable of transforming Tesla into an artificial-intelligence juggernaut. The board added that Musk, during negotiations, raised the prospect of “prioritizing other ventures” if he and the board couldn’t agree on compensation. Corporate governance experts said the board is taking a huge risk by so explicitly staking its future on one leader. Wei Jiang, vice dean at Emory University’s business school, said Tesla’s board has granted Musk a “monopoly” on Tesla’s top job. Good corporate governance, she said, requires embracing a “competitive and fluid market for CEOs.” Musk’s hardest performance targets are likely those involving profit, a measure with no room for interpretation. The directors set eight profit goals between $50 billion and $400 billion in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, compared to Tesla’s 2024 earnings of $16.6 billion. Tesla’s EV business, which accounts for almost all its revenue, is deteriorating with aging models facing fierce competition. Its only newer model, the Cybertruck, has flopped. The way Musk’s compensation is structured, however, allows for massive payouts without hitting any profit target. Every goal combined with a market-value increase offers the same 1% stock payout. So Musk gets the same pay for meeting the relatively easy vehicle sales and FSD-subscription goals, for instance, as he would for boosting earnings five-fold to $80 billion. The board’s valuation goals may prove far easier than its profit targets. Tesla’s value could hit $2 trillion, for instance, if shares grow a modest 6.4% annually over the decade following the board’s Sept. 3 pay-package approval. That’s slower growth than the S&P 500’s 8.5% annual average over the past 30 years and less than half the Nasdaq’s 13.2% average. Seth Goldstein, a Morningstar analyst who tracks Tesla, said its valuation could easily hit $3 trillion or more over a decade with market-average performance. He pointed out, however, that Tesla’s value is already largely based on “future products that don’t exist today.” For Musk to claim the biggest payouts offered by Tesla’s board, Goldstein said, “we’re going to start having to see real products.” Kevin Murphy, a University of Southern California finance professor and an expert witness for Tesla in defending Musk’s 2018 pay package, acknowledged that the vehicle sales and $2 trillion valuation goals aren’t “much of a stretch” but simply reaching those won’t appease shareholders. Neither will the “handful of billions” for lower-rung goals matter much to Musk, who cares more about historic technological achievements, Murphy said. Shareholders, he said, have focused on the hardest goals and biggest payouts because they believe Musk – and only Musk – can hit them. “Is it worth it?” Murphy said. “Shareholders seem to think so.” Sharjeel Imam has filed an interim bail plea to contest the Bihar assembly elections as an independent candidate while being in Tihar Jail for his alleged involvement in the 2020 Delhi riots. He claims to have no political party support and his younger brother is the only one helping him. The Delhi Police Special Cell has accused him of radical and communal activities.

Wall Street is hedging its bets. While the S&P 500, the world’s most followed stock market index, keeps hitting record highs every other day amid a three-year bull run, gold, which usually moves in the opposite direction to shares, has been on a tear of its own. The price of the safe-haven asset has jumped more than 50 per cent so far this year to breach $4,000 (€3,443) an ounce for the first time. Reasons for the gold rush abound. Many market strategists say the precious metal is being used as a hedge against economic uncertainty caused by Trump administration tariffs. Some point to a fall this year in the value of the dollar, the currency in which gold is priced. And others say gold is a safe bet in case the artificial intelligence (AI) boom that has been fuelling the stock market starts to fizzle out. But, for Ron O’Hanley, chairman and chief executive of State Street – a leading administrator to the global investment management industry and one of the biggest asset managers in its own right – the reason for the anomaly may be more simple. [ ‘Gold-plated Fomo’ powers bullion’s record-breaking rallyOpens in new window ] “In some ways, gold is an indicator of what investors’ beliefs are about long-term inflation prospects,” O’Hanley says, speaking to The Irish Times in Dublin this week. There are good reasons to be concerned about rising inflation over time. “If you look at government debt levels, there’s been a fundamental change if you think about the ’08 period to where we are now,” he says. “The pandemic proved quite costly in the taking on of government debt.” Global government debt surged from 58 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2007 to 93 per cent last year, or almost $100 trillion, driven by the borrowings to support businesses and households during Covid lockdowns, according to the International Monetary Fund. Some investors believe central banks may, eventually, tolerate higher inflation to reduce the real burden of public debt. So, why is the equity market continuing to rise? “In aggregate, consumer debt levels are in pretty good shape relative to where they were in the past. Corporate debt levels are also in pretty good shape,” says O’Hanley. “That is a good signal to the equity market.” The impact of the so-called Magnificent Seven tech stocks that have driven the S&P 500 in recent years – Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla – is now starting to broaden to other companies, he says. Official interest rates are continuing to decline. Meanwhile, corporate earnings are, for the time being at least, also holding up well – with the consensus forecast among analysts pointing to 10 per cent earnings per share growth this year in the US – even as many industries are absorbing much of the impact of tariffs, rather than passing them on to customers. A survey published by KPMG last week found that just a fifth of US businesses have passed on over half of new tariff expenses. O’Hanley, whose group has $49 trillion of assets under custody and administration (almost the equivalent of the US and EU economies combined, measured by GDP), is on the fence – publicly at least – on the long-term effects of US president Donald Trump’s protectionist trade policies. “That’s the $64,000 question that everybody’s asking. And probably the entity that is asking it the most is the Federal Reserve. There is a school of thought that the tariffs are a one-time price reset and they shouldn’t actually reset inflation expectations. Others say this has a rolling impact that will be cumulative – and in a way that we just don’t know.” The biggest challenge is ongoing uncertainty, as many tariffs are still not finalised, he says, more than six months after Trump’s Liberation Day speech. The broader question is the future of globalisation. “Whether you call it deglobalisation or a reordering of globalisation, we’re going to see change – and national interests become much more prominent,” he says. “We’re in a period of adjustment. And the biggest challenge to investors and companies is that it’s very hard to make a decision that has long-term implications when you’ve got this kind of uncertainty.” It must be disorienting to ponder for someone whose career began at the dawn of the era of hyperglobalisation. Following the completion of a master’s in business administration (MBA) at Harvard Business School in 1986, Hanley joined management consultancy McKinsey, where he would end up as a partner and head of the firm’s investment management practice worldwide. [ ‘You’d have to have been a turkey not to have made money in venture capital in 1997’Opens in new window ] He subsequently joined Mellon Financial Corporation in 1997 and went on, following the group’s 2007 merger with Bank of New York, to serve as the wider BNY Mellon group’s asset management arm. Hanley also spent a four-year stint in a senior role at Fidelity Investments before joining State Street in 2015 as head of the investment management arm. State Street traces its roots back to 1792 as Union Bank in Boston. Fifty years ago it shifted its focus from commercial banking to the plumbing work that takes place after shares and bonds are traded – like clearing, settlement and custody – as well as asset management. State Street set up an Irish operation in 1996 and has since become one of the largest international financial services employers in the State, employing about 2,300 people in offices in Dublin, Kilkenny, Naas, Co Kildare, and Drogheda, Co Louth. Almost a decade and a half ago, the investment arm bought Bank of Ireland Asset Management (BIAM), once the crown jewel of the Irish bank. BIAM had €26 billion of assets under management (AUM) at the time. The US group had $49 trillion of assets under custody and administration as of the end of June. Its asset management arm, rebranded as State Street Investment Management this year, had $5.12 trillion of AUM. While O’Hanley’s appointment as incoming CEO of State Street in November 2017 marked the culmination of his career, a report in The Boston Globe the next day drew attention to a less flattering episode from his distant past. It’s interesting to see all the excitement in AI as if it was invented in 2023 ... we – and others – have been on this AI journey for many, many years It reported that he withdrew from Vanderbilt University Law School in 1983 after admitting to plagiarism as editor-in-chief of the Vanderbilt Law Review. A day after the report, he issued an email to staff, acknowledging that “as a student I made a big mistake”. State Street stood by O’Hanley. A spokeswoman said at the time that he had fully disclosed the matter and the organisation supported him “unequivocally”. His “track record as a corporate leader and his achievements both at State Street and in his previous roles speak for themselves”, she added. Under O’Hanley’s tenure as CEO, which officially began in January 2019, the group’s assets under custody and administration have jumped 55 per cent, while assets under management have more than doubled. While the softly-spoken executive is a lower-profile figure than many other bosses of top US financial institutions – such as JP Morgan’s Jamie Dimon, Larry Fink of BlackRock or Jane Fraser at Citigroup – he is well regarded in the asset management and administration world. Last year, Global Custodian, the go-to publication for the industry, gave him a lifetime achievement award. The past three years have seen State Street take out $1.3 billion of running expenses, driven by the use of AI to do more mundane tasks normally carried out by entry-level workers, O’Hanley told a conference in June. He said the underlying global headcount fell by 4,000 last year – even as the headline figure jumped 13 per cent to 53,000 as it consolidated an Indian joint venture into the group. “It’s interesting to see all the excitement in AI as if it was invented in 2023,” he says now. “But we – and others – have been on this AI journey for many, many years.” [ AI’s replacement of humans in HR is emblematic of what could happen across the workplaceOpens in new window ] Machine learning has long been used for one of the most important daily tasks of State Street: calculating the net asset value (NAV) of tens of thousands of funds. “Fifteen or 20 years ago, markets would close and a flurry of activity would start to work out what happened in a fund that day – the buys, the sells, the corporate actions, the dividends paid and received – to come up with a net asset value. It typically took an hour and a half to produce and send on to clients. “What’s happening now, with machine learning, is that the NAV is being calculated transaction by transaction every day. That was, if you will, a prior generation of AI.” State Street is currently teaming up its software engineers with what he calls “AI buddies”. And it is encouraging employees to continually think differently about how AI can be used at work. “I’m often amazed at some of the ideas that come up. Some you might think of as trite, but they’re actually changing work in a fundamental way. The housing crisis isn’t unique to Ireland. Our home city of Boston is equally challenged when it comes to housing. It’s a global problem “For example, take the end of a financial period. Again, that’s a time when a lot of people spring into action. All that work has now shortened. Is it reducing the number of people? Not really. But time that was spent on identifying ‘what happened’ is collapsing. That’s created more time for the ‘so what’ of what’s happened – the analysis around it.” Most importantly, it’s left time to consider the ‘now what?’ – what are we going to do next?” he says. “AI will change the way we work. But, like a lot of change, it will take time, and then it will go fast.” Will AI lead to dystopian scenario of the robots taking over white-collar jobs, or create a future where people are free to enjoy greater leisure and personal fulfilment? “I think neither is going to happen. For the most part, it will change the nature of work for the positive,” he says. “It’ll put new requirements on employees. It will also have implications for the education system. We need to move away from a way of thinking, where people go, ‘I know exactly what my child needs. They need to go to coding camp and be prepared to be an electrical engineer.’ In future, you need to be a problem solver and you need to be a lifelong learner.” O’Hanley (68) says he spends about 60 per cent of his working life away from Boston. He has been in Ireland this week for a series of meetings and to speak at a convention in Dublin on Thursday. He has Irish roots on both sides of his family tree. Forebears of his mother, whose family name was Fagan, moved to the US in the 18th century. “The O’Hanley’s were famine emigrants from Roscommon in the late 1840s,” he says. “They took the classic journey, with a couple of generations in Canada before making their way down to the Boston-Rhode Island area.” O’Hanley also speaks about State Street’s commitment to regional Irish towns and cities, even as rival BNY Mellon recently decided to close its offices in Wexford and Cork – affecting hundreds of jobs – to improve “operational efficiency”. Dublin’s position at the epicentre of a national housing crisis makes it more important to spread the company’s Irish operations to attract and keep “talent”, O’Hanley says. [ Dublin is becoming a place of extremes, home to only the very richest and the poorestOpens in new window ] “The housing crisis isn’t unique to Ireland. Our home city of Boston is equally challenged when it comes to housing. It’s a global problem.” The CEO says he’s “actually quite encouraged” by Government efforts to boost housing supply. While economists say the Government faces major challenges meeting its target of delivering 300,000 new homes by 2030, home builders have concluded that Budget 2026 measures aimed at rebooting apartment building – together with new apartment construction guidelines unveiled during the summer – have moved the dial significantly and will help narrow the viability gap for apartment construction. “But, like everybody else,” O’Hanley says, “we’d like to see more, faster.” Name: Ron O’Hanley.

PHOTO ILLUSTRATION: PIXABAY Published Oct 10, 2025, 11:30 AM Updated Oct 10, 2025, 12:59 PM NEW YORK – In June, Mr Elon Musk predicted that artificial intelligence (AI) would become smarter than any human by the end of 2026. In July, OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman said his company’s product “is going to reshape the course of human history”. Mr Mark Zuckerberg has imagined creating “a personal superintelligence that helps you achieve your goals, create what you want to see in the world”. The CEOs are backing up their words with dollars. Five of the biggest tech companies are together spending an estimated US$371 billion (S$482 billion) in 2025 on the massive data centres necessary to train and run complex AI models. That figure is expected to increase in the years to come: McKinsey & Co projects that data centres will require US$5.2 trillion in spending by 2030 to keep up with demand for AI. All that spending raises the question: Will AI ever produce enough revenue to justify the price? The maths is daunting. In 2025, AI technology is expected to generate US$60 billion in revenue, according to one estimate by writers Azeem Azhar and Nathan Warren of AI-focused newsletter Exponential View. That number will need to increase dramatically if tech companies want to recoup costs. In September, Bain & Co calculated that Big Tech would need US$2 trillion in additional annual revenue to pay for data centre expenditures by 2030 and projected a shortfall of US$800 billion a year even under ideal circumstances. If AI giants and their investors can’t make their money back, then we’re talking about a historically large case of overbuilding and overinvestment. There might even be a word for that. “I believe it’s a bubble,” says Mr Harris Kupperman, founder of Praetorian Capital Management, a self-described contrarian hedge fund with about US$300 million in assets under management. “Will there ever be a payback on this stuff? I think the answer is ‘highly unlikely’.” Covering the cost of just 2025’s build-out will require additional revenue of US$480 billion, according to Mr Kupperman’s calculations. Where that will come from is unclear, especially considering that for most users, ChatGPT is currently free. “If they charged you a couple dollars every time you queried ChatGPT, I don’t know if they’d have a market,” Mr Kupperman says. It doesn’t help that graphics processing units (GPUs) – the essential computer chips for AI that account for a significant chunk of data centre costs – depreciate quickly. In past bubbles, such as the railroad construction of the 19th century or the telecommunications build-out of the early 2000s, the overspending at least created lasting infrastructure. Even if people didn’t use the railroad tracks right away, they remained useful for decades, as was the fibre-optic cable laid in the 1990s. GPUs, in contrast, appear to have a shelf life of just a few years before they need to be reassigned to more basic AI tasks. The maths makes AI spending seem less like a flywheel than a hamster wheel. Then there are the bottlenecks, which could prevent many planned AI factories from reaching completion. While data centres typically take two to three years to build, hooking them up to an energy source can take up to eight years, according to Boston Consulting Group. So it will take that much longer for data centres to begin generating revenue. And that’s if the energy is available at all: A 2024 review by the Commonwealth of Virginia, the data centre capital of the world, concluded that meeting the unconstrained energy needs of this infrastructure would be “very difficult”, and even meeting half of that demand would be “difficult”. Sceptics also point to disappointing performance by the AI tools themselves. A much-cited study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Lab found that 95 per cent of AI projects piloted by businesses have produced no measurable return. McKinsey reported that almost eight in 10 companies that adopt generative AI see “no significant bottom-line impact”. OpenAI released GPT-5 in August to tepid reviews, raising questions about the industry’s assumption that more data is better when it comes to AI. Finally, observers concerned about an AI bubble point to the circularity of recent deals – for example, Nvidia is selling chips to OpenAI while also investing in it – that has echoes of the telecoms bubble. They also worry about the growing opacity of funding mechanisms. In August, Meta Platforms raised US$29 billion for data centres from private credit firms. Big start-ups such as OpenAI and CoreWeave have also leaned on private credit for data centre financing. These agreements often take the form of obscure special purpose vehicles, which keep the debt off the big companies’ balance sheets and make the health of the investments hard to track. There are also signs that the exposure of average investors to these risky bets is growing, as private credit firms raise money from insurance companies and real-estate-focused exchange-traded funds invest in data centres, according to investor and writer Paul Kedrosky. And of course anyone who owns shares in a mutual fund is most likely betting on data centres via Big Tech stocks. The AI bulls – which, judging by stock market trends, include most investors – aren’t too concerned. In their view, revenue from generative AI is growing and will continue to grow. And while the infrastructure build-out looks big, it’s not that big compared with certain past bubbles, write Mr Azhar and Mr Warren of Exponential View. As a proportion of gross domestic product, spending on railroads during that boom was four times greater than current spending on AI infrastructure. Most important, Big Tech companies have plenty of cash; they can afford to lose a few hundred billion dollars. Mr Altman and Mr Zuckerberg have both suggested they’re focused on the long game rather than immediate profits. The question is how long their investors will take the same view. The challenge of any bubble is not knowing if it will pop but when. Entrepreneurial studies clinical assistant professor Erik Gordon of the University of Michigan says the first signs of fading optimism are likely to appear in venture capital funding for AI start-ups. “You might see the size of funding rounds go down,” he says. Public stock prices would most likely follow. (For now, it’s still up, up, up.) Until then, the AI explosion is something of a Rorschach test: What you see depends on how you view AI’s prospects broadly. Haters have been calling the boom financially unsustainable for ages. Those who believe in the technology’s potential seem to have faith that it will still grow and improve fast enough to recoup costs – even if the traditional laws of the market suggest otherwise.

Title: Why The Bull Market Should Keep Going

ByLarry Light, Senior Contributor. Will the good times for stocks stay rolling? Likely, yes, in the face of some daunting obstacles. A year ago, this column predicted that stocks probably would continue their winning ways in 2025. Up to now, that upbeat prognosis has held true, with equities powering past a Washington-induced April chill. The U.S. is completing the third year of a bull run, with the S&P 500 climbing almost 90%. (FactSet Research dates the start of the bull market at Oct. 12, 2022.) Of course, no one knows whether some X factor will appear to halt positive market momentum and shove investments into a hole. Recall last April, when President Donald Trump first announced his planned tariffs—and investors freaked out. The heartening news is that stocks recovered their equilibrium from that presidential pronouncement and then some. This has been the story of 2025, and with luck stocks will keep up their welcome performance. Factors benefiting stocks include a relatively low inflation rate, a decent (if not roaring) economy and artificial intelligence’s popularity. The S&P 500 this year is up 14.5% through Thursday, having shaken off the April panic, as the tariffs thus far appear not to have harmed growth, or if so, just marginally. A poll of registered investment advisors (RIAs) this summer found cautious optimism, with almost two-thirds of respondents expecting the S&P to rise 6% to 9% over the ensuing 12 months. The poll, by advisory firm Security Benefit (with data from Greenwald Research), found scant RIA expectations for a near-term recession. “We’re in the middle innings of the bull market,” says Joseph Quinlan, head of CIO market strategy for Merrill and Bank of America, in an interview. He points to strong stock buybacks and high-income consumer spending as propellants for the equities surge. Indeed, stockholders have spent over $1 trillion on share repurchases over the past 12 months through September, per Morningstar, and consumer spending is healthy, although more so for wealthier Americans, a BofA study found. Certainly, some have worried about whether inflation will rise meaningfully, especially as the tariffs take hold. The Federal Reserve has an annual 2% target for inflation, but that has proven elusive. Thus far, the Consumer Price Index has stayed just below 3% annually (the next CPI release, covering September, is on Oct. 15, if the shutdown doesn’t thwart it). A survey by the New York Federal Reserve Bank showed that households believe inflation will tick up slightly above 3% over the next year, hardly a baleful scenario. Up ahead, macroeconomic conditions appear favorable, on balance. Macro, after all, typically drives the market. The Fed believes that gross domestic product will maintain a steady, modestly improving pace going forward, clocking a median annual increase of 1.6% this year, 1.8% in 2026 and 1.9% in 2027. You’d think that the U.S. government shutdown would kneecap stocks. But as Sam Stovall, CFRA’s chief investment strategist, points out in a research note, the market has tended to “drift higher” in previous Washington closures. The thinking apparently is that no lasting damage will occur and the stoppage will be temporary. To date, the market has largely shrugged off the shutdown: The S&P climbed 0.58% on Wednesday and Thursday closed down 0.34%. Overall, since the shutdown started, the index has inched up 0.62%. One big reason for optimism about the market: Lower interest rates soon are a strong possibility. Recently released minutes of the Federal Reserve’s policymaking board in mid-September indicated that the Fed is tilted toward two more cuts this year, one-quarter percentage point each. In that same meeting, the central bank moved to slice its benchmark rate by a quarter-point, to a 4.0% to 4.25% range, its first reduction of 2025. The most-discussed catalyst behind much of the market growth lately is artificial intelligence. The widespread fascination with AI’s promise has been stoked by a massive buildout of data centers. Meta Platforms and Oracle are among the tech giants pouring vast sums into this arena. The gargantuan capital spending has doubled GDP this year, by some estimates. Meta’s stock is up 25% in 2025 and Oracle’s 79%. A large question looms about whether all these outlays will pay off, and skeptics declare that the enthusiasm is reminiscent of the 1990s dot-com boom, which ended badly. Profits from AI are hard to find, as of yet. Still, the craze over the dot-com industry was not wrong, just early. Since that bust, a third of a century ago, the Web has gone on to dominate the world’s culture and commerce. Long-term investors should take heed. In the meantime, stocks should remain rewarding for investors. Nobody knows for how long, but the immediate future looks pretty good.

More Info As we approach the end of the 2025 financial year, the U.S. stock market continues its defiant rally, shrugging off concerns about job losses, a partial government shutdown, and geopolitical instability. While the S&P 500 has surged with a roughly 14.2% year-to-date (YTD) gain, fueled largely by the relentless AI-driven investment boom—a phenomenon reshaping capital flows from semiconductors to energy infrastructure—the overall Energy sector is lagging badly. With a mere 4.5% YTD gain, it holds the third-lowest spot among major sectors, as oil and gas producers contend with softer commodity prices, the unwinding of OPEC+ cuts, rising costs, and elevated tariffs. Yet, beneath the surface of this underperforming sector, a significant transformation is taking hold.... A rebound in clean energy has seen the iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN) rise nearly 40 % this year, with demand tied to AI data centers and electrification is driving new investing patterns. Solar stocks are also benefiting, bolstered by policy support and tax incentives preserved (in part) under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). One recent Oilprice article warns that OBBBA “gutted key tax incentives for clean energy projects” and warns the bill’s impact on solar could worsen over time. The U.S. Senate’s July passage of OBBBA without last-minute excise taxes on solar that some lawmakers had proposed also helped stabilize investor sentiment in domestic solar and storage. The removal of those tariffs lent clearer direction to the U.S. clean energy supply chain and gave developers greater confidence in the viability of long-term projects. This shared agenda of capital rotating toward electrification, AI-driven power demand, and policy stability is creating room for a diverse set of energy names to outperform. These winners are not all pure-play renewables. They include integrated power operators, utilities reinventing themselves, and grid-tech enablers. Below are five off-the-radar energy stocks quietly outperforming their peers. Market Cap: $2.20B YTD Returns: 161.4% Israel-based smart energy SolarEdge (NASDAQ: SEDG) has been one of the best performers in the solar sector, alongside the broader Israeli stock market, with SEDG up in the triple digits thanks to the company’s improving business fundamentals. SolarEdge returned yet another healthy quarterly scorecard on Tuesday, with second quarter revenue of $289.4M (+9.0% Y/Y) beating the Wall Street consensus by $14.91 million, while non-GAAP EPS of -$0.81 beat by $0.03. According to SolarEdge CEO Yehoshua Nir, Trump’s OBBBA "validates our multiyear strategy of onshoring manufacturing to the U.S. by preserving the 45X advanced manufacturing credit for the next 7 years. We intend to manufacture in the U.S. and to ship U.S.-made SolarEdge products both domestically and across the globe for years to come." SolarEdge’s gross margins continued to improve, increasing 310 basis points sequentially to 11.1%. The company reported that the ongoing supply chain optimizations will cut gross margins by ~ 2%, down from a previous forecast of 4% to 6%. SolarEdge also issued upbeat guidance, with third quarter revenue in the range of $315 million to $355 million, representing 28.4% Y/Y growth at the midpoint while non-GAAP gross margin is expected to be 15% -19%, including the 2% of new tariff impact. Market Cap: $165.0B YTD Returns: 83.7% GE Vernova (NYSE:GE) is one of the youngest energy companies, having been spun off by industrial giant General Electric (NYSE:GE) in 2024. GE Vernova is a global energy company that develops and provides products and services for generating, transmitting, and orchestrating electricity. With a market cap roughly half that of its parent company, GE Vernova is one of the largest renewable energy companies, with its GE Renewable Energy division offering a broad portfolio of wind, hydro, storage, and solar technologies. GEV shares have increased more than five-fold from their IPO price, thanks to rising global demand for the company’s services, strong backlog growth and multiple tailwinds from electrification and decarbonization. However, the wild runup has lately attracted some downgrades from Wall Street, with RBC Capital recently trimming GEV price target from $631, with the bank saying the company’s strong outlook is already reflected in the valuation. Market Cap: $113.8B YTD Returns: 60.1% Constellation Energy Corp. (NYSE:CEG) produces and sells energy, including electricity and natural gas, along with sustainable energy solutions to commercial, industrial, residential, and public sector customers. The company operates a diverse portfolio of generation assets, including nuclear, wind, solar, natural gas, and hydroelectric power, with a total capacity of approximately 31,676 megawatts. CEG shares have been on a tear after the company unveiled an agreement in June to sell more than 1,100 MW of nuclear power to Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) from its Illinois nuclear plant for 20 years. According to The Wall Street Journal, the deal is the first deal of its kind for an operating nuclear plant in the United States, and closely mirrors a similar deal Constellation signed with Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) last year. The Microsoft deal is a 20-year power purchase agreement (PPA) that will see Constellation Energy restart its undamaged reactor in Three Mile Island, which was undergoing decommissioning. Neither deal will draw power from the main grid. However, Meta appears to have secured a better deal, with Citi’s Ryan Levine estimating that the 20-year PPA is priced in the $70-$95/MWh range, considerably cheaper than Jefferies' estimate of at least $110/MWh for Microsoft's PPA, because Meta’s deal “...does not offer a substantial premium for low-carbon nuclear power”. Levine has projected that ~70% of Constellation's existing nuclear plants could secure comparable datacenter deals at ~$80/MWh. Market Cap: $67.9B YTD Returns: 44.8% Irving, Texas-based Vistra Corp. (NYSE:VST) is an integrated power generation company that generates and sells power to residential, commercial, and industrial customers across the United States. The company operates a diverse portfolio of power generation facilities, including natural gas, nuclear, coal, solar, and battery energy storage, and serves customers through retail brands like TXU Energy and Ambit Energy. VST shares have easily outpaced their energy brethren thanks to the company recording increased power demand from AI data centers and strong results from recent PJM capacity auctions, which are creating a favorable market environment for Vistra's generation and retail operations. Vistra’s diversified fleet, strategic positioning in the nuclear power sector through the Harbor Energy acquisition, and focus on long-term growth and customer-tailored solutions also contribute to investor confidence. Market Cap: $10.3B YTD Returns: 12.7% The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) is a Virginia-based power generation and utility company that operates in the United States and internationally. AES is actively transforming into a leader in renewable energy, focusing on solar, wind, and energy storage solutions to accelerate a greener energy future. AES shares have been rallying following a report by the Financial Times that BlackRock's (NYSE:BLK) Global Infrastructure Partners plans to acquire the utility company soon, in what would be one of the largest infrastructure takeovers on record. The deal would value AES at ~$38 billion, AES’ $29 billion in debt.

If businesses pull back on their AI spending because they find the tools are not that helpful, it could cause major problems for the AI industry. By Thor Benson Share Save Despite United States President Donald Trump’s tariff and immigration policies roiling businesses, the US economy is relatively stable. Experts say the country can thank the artificial intelligence (AI) industry for that. “AI machines—in quite a literal sense—appear to be saving the US economy right now,” George Saravelos of Deutsche Bank wrote to his clients at the end of September. “In the absence of tech-related spending, the US would be close to, or in, recession this year.” Economist and Nobel laureate Paul Krugman has made similar observations in his Substack newsletter. AI companies are investing hundreds of billions of dollars into AI infrastructure and development, and other US companies are spending billions on AI products. Just last month, a data centre in Abeline, Texas, the flagship site of the $500bn Stargate programme, a joint venture between Oracle, OpenAI and Japan’s SoftBank to advance AI infrastructure in the US, came online. Around the same time, chipmaker Nvidia said it would invest up to $100bn in OpenAI and provide it with data centre chips. It also became the first US company to hit a $4 trillion market value. It was soon followed in that benchmark by Microsoft, which has seen its stock price surge, with AI one of key factors driving business demand. Nvidia and Microsoft are not alone. Google’s parent company Alphabet and Meta Platforms, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, have upped their commitments to their AI ambitions and investments. All of this enthusiasm surrounding AI appears to be holding up the US economy for the moment, but there are fears that this could be a “bubble” similar to the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s. “The reason people are worried about an AI bubble is because seven companies are pulling more than 400 others forward,” Campbell Harvey, a professor of finance at Duke University, told Al Jazeera. A look at the S&P 500 shows that seven tech companies that are heavily involved in AI are the ones creating the most growth. Harvey admits that since it’s still early days in AI adoption and growth, it’s hard to say if the stocks of those tech companies are overvalued. “While share prices look somewhat elevated, there’s also real revenue behind the massive push to build data centres,” said Carl Frey, an associate professor of AI & Work at Oxford University. “A bubble may be building, but we’re nowhere near tulip mania territory,” he said, referring to the massive increase in tulip prices in the Netherlands in the 17th century, an event often held up as a hallmark of a bubble. “The worry is that early AI adopters are having second thoughts. Large corporations that rushed in are narrowing projects to the few that clearly save money or make money, and putting the rest on ice,” he said. For instance, major corporations like IBM and Klarna cut thousands of jobs in customer service and replaced them with AI—only to start reversing course not so long after they made that decision. They found the technology couldn’t do everything they hoped, compared to human workers. If major corporations that have spent large sums of money adopting AI tools end up deciding that these tools are not actually that useful for their businesses, that could be a serious problem for AI companies. They could end up with fewer customers, and their stock prices could begin to tumble as projected profits decline. A report released by MIT in August found that 95 percent of companies that have adopted AI are not achieving significant revenue acceleration from it. Data from the US Census Bureau shows that AI adoption by large companies has started to slow down recently. It would appear that people are starting to question the utility of these AI tools, which are often used to replace people in jobs like customer service, software engineering and several other entry-level jobs. “There’s a growing sense that a lot of companies raced to add AI to their operations last year because of the hype surrounding its power, and the fear of falling behind,” said Cal Newport, a professor of computer science at Georgetown University. “It turns out, however, that integrating generative AI, in particular, into existing workflows in significantly useful ways is harder than people thought.” Newport says the underlying models in these AI programmes are currently “too unreliable” to be able to successfully automate jobs. He notes the idea that we would see AI rapidly taking jobs right now “has simply not come true”. A recent Stanford study found that entry-level jobs in customer service, accounting and software development have decreased by 13 percent since 2022 because of the adoption of AI tools in large companies. It’s not clear that AI has reached “bubble” territory yet, but it might, and if that bubble were to burst, it could do a lot of damage to the US economy. Frey says the dot-com bubble was very costly for investors, but it “left behind technologies and infrastructure that ultimately lifted productivity.” The question is whether this AI situation will play out the same way. “Unless an AI bust topples a major lender and triggers a full-blown financial crisis, the bigger risk today is different,” Frey said. “AI hasn’t yet delivered a clear, broad-based productivity boost—precisely what our stagnating economies need.” Follow Al Jazeera English:

Title: Valve’s Next Headset May Be Coming Soon, Just as Meta Loses Interest in VR

Time Published: 2025-10-09T15:08:36Z

reading time 3 minutes I’ve been hitting the “it’s a bad time to be into VR” note a lot lately, and, sorry ya’ll, I stand by that stance… but maybe not for long. As discouraging as this year has been for VR enthusiasts (Meta barely mentioned the Quest at its annual Connect dev conference), Valve might swoop in sooner than you think to give VR hardware a shred of hope or at least a little bit of excitement. According to a report for XR Institute (a Chinese analyst group that I’ve cited before for accurate forecasts on smart glasses), Valve’s long-rumored “Deckard” headset is finally entering mass production, with a chance that it could be available before the end of the year. XR Institute says that it expects Valve to launch Deckard (an internal codename for the headset) during the holiday season with a starting yearly production of about 400,000 to 600,000 units. That’s about the initial Vision Pro release levels of stock and certainly much more encouraging than rumors about Samsung’s Project Moohan, which suggest a launch in South Korea only to start. While Deckard’s existence is from news, its imminent arrival isÂ a big deal, not just because of Valve’s success in the hardware space with the Steam Deck, but because of the de-emphasis of VR by other major players in the space. Apple is reportedly deprioritizing a cheaper Vision Pro to focus on smart glasses, while Meta already started that same train by launching three new pairs of smart glasses and zero new VR/XR headsets. While this might not be a shining moment for VR writ large, I like the prospects of a Valve-made VR headset. While other companies like Apple and most likely Samsung tend to take a more scattershot approach to XR/VR, incorporating work and communication, I expect Valve to focus more on gaming and less on the other stuff, which… is a good thing. I’m not saying there aren’t cool or fun experiences to be had outside of gaming in an XR/VR headset, but entertainment (games in particular) is still the most compelling of those experiences. Don’t get me wrong, the audience for VR games is niche, even despite the ascendence of VR headsets over the last five years, but it seems to me that the people who use headsets the most are the ones who are more deeply invested in playing games in them. VR gaming enthusiasts’ response to Valve’s headset is still dependent on a lot of things, though, price chief among them. Rumors from earlier this year have suggested Deckard could cost around $1,000, which is notably a lot more expensive than the Quest 3 and even more so than the Quest 3S, but still well under the $3,500 Vision Pro. To justify that price, I assume Valve will have to lean into its display tech, offering better resolution and probably better performance than competitors like the Quest 3 and 3S. A lighter headset would be a nice perk, but I’m not sure what Valve will have to offer on the front, if anything. SteamOS in VR seems like an obvious opportunity here, though, again, I’m not sure anyone will be rushing out to buy a new VR headset just for the UI. There’s still a lot we don’t know about Deckard, so it’s hard to say for sure whether it’ll be the jolt of excitement VR fans are pining for, but at least (between Project Moohan and Deckard) there’s something to look forward to.

Jim Edwards is the executive editor for global news at Fortune. He was previously the editor-in-chief of Business Insider's news division and the founding editor of Business Insider UK. His investigative journalism has changed the law in two U.S. federal districts and two states. The U.S. Supreme Court cited his work on the death penalty in the concurrence to Baze v. Rees, the ruling on whether lethal injection is cruel or unusual. He also won the Neal award for an investigation of bribes and kickbacks on Madison Avenue. The S&P 500 hit a new all-time high Wednesday (up 0.58% on the day), driven as usual by tech stocks (the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.12%), despite the fact that both the IMF and the Bank of England warned that AI might be a bubble and stocks are due for a sharp correction. For weeks, all the talk on Wall Street is that the growth of the AI sector must, surely, be unsustainable and that this bubble is due to pop. The record-high price of gold alone suggests that a lot of investors want a hedge against an implosion in U.S. tech stocks. Yet some analysts are saying that you should believe the hype. They argue: The biggest cheerleader for AI is, of course, Dan Ives at Wedbush, who recently published a note titled “Expecting a Robust 3Q Tech Earnings Season to Match the AI Hype; Popcorn Moment.” “The cloud stalwarts Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon had very robust AI enterprise demand in the quarter based on our field checks. While some investors continue to question the valuations and pace of this tech spending trend, we believe to the contrary the Street is still underestimating how big this AI spending trajectory is,” he told clients. He believes these companies will spend $3 trillion on AI over the next three years. Importantly, that spending isn’t coming from debt or VC funding, according to Jan Frederik Slijkerman and Timothy Rahill at ING. They recently published a note examining whether all this AI spending might hurt corporate credit quality and discovered that … everything is totally fine! “Investments by the largest technology companies [Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, and Oracle] are expected to surpass the U.S.$400 billion mark in 2026 … The investments described above are mind-blowing, given their scale. What is even more striking is that these investments have been funded from operating cash flows,” they wrote. “From a debtholder perspective, we are less concerned with a potential mismatch between supply and demand, as the large technology platforms mentioned above have funded their expansion plans from their cash flows,” they said. Goldman Sachs agrees, in part for the same reasons. The bank published a note yesterday titled “Why we are not in a bubble … yet,” which pretty much says it all. Still, surely stocks are overvalued? The majority of gains in the S&P 500 this year have been driven by a handful of tech companies. That concentration risk could hurt investors if there is a pullback. We aren’t there yet, according to Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist for LPL Financial in Boston. “The forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of the S&P 500 has yet to reach dotcom era levels, and in fact remains below December 2020 levels because earnings were depressed coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic,” he said in a note today. “So large-cap stocks are expensive, lifted by AI-driven technology stocks, but not quite to the extremes of 25 years ago.” The economics of AI are much more robust than the dotcom era, he says. “Perhaps the key difference between the broader secular AI growth theme and the dotcom era is that large AI hyperscalers have mostly funded capital expenditures (capex) with strong internal cash flows, not through AI revenue in singularity or by issuing debt or equity. In comparison, dotcom era spending was broadly funded through massive amounts of ‘vendor financing,’ which ultimately led to the circular flow of capital that fueled the bubble burst.” And even if there is a correction, it won’t be too bad, argue Samuel Tombs and Oliver Allen at Pantheon Macroeconomics. They estimate that AI capex boosted U.S. GDP growth by 0.3% points. Even if it all disappeared it would not be enough to tip the U.S. into recession, they say. “Weaker growth is more likely than a recession if the AI boom turns to bust,” they said in a note to clients. “The likely hit from the AI boom turning to bust would be a significant drag on the economy, but probably a smaller shock than the bursting of the dotcom bubble in 2000, and an ensuing recession would be far from a forgone conclusion.” That comes with a caveat: “It would be more alarming, though, if a reversal of AI optimism led to a broader correction in the stock market beyond AI-linked companies, especially if the hit to households’ wealth and confidence tipped the fragile balance in the labor market, leading to a jump in the layoff rate,” they said.

Title: OpenAI's ChatGPT Instant Checkout: The Dawn of Conversational Commerce CX

CMSWire's Marketing & Customer Experience Leadership channel is the go-to hub for actionable research, editorial and opinion for CMOs, aspiring CMOs and today's customer experience innovators. Our dedicated editorial and research teams focus on bringing you the data and information you need to navigate today's complex customer, organizational and technical landscapes. We've got you covered. Since its November 2022 launch, ChatGPT has become synonymous with general AI capabilities. Now OpenAI is extending its influence toward a new frontier: ecommerce. OpenAI has officially transformed ChatGPT from a discovery tool into a complete commerce platform with the launch of Instant Checkout, powered by the Agentic Commerce Protocol developed in partnership with Stripe. Starting with U.S. Etsy sellers and expanding soon to over one million Shopify merchants, including Glossier, SKIMS, Spanx, and Vuori, this development represents more than just another checkout option. It is a fundamental reimagining of the customer experience journey that could have been implications on the customer experience industry. Customer experience professionals in e-commerce and retail recognize OpenAI’s entry as a signal that the entire paradigm of how customers discover and purchase products is shifting toward agentic commerce — online shopping managed with AI. Instant Checkout enables ChatGPT users to complete purchases without leaving the conversational interface. When someone asks a shopping-related question—"best running shoes under $100" or "gifts for a ceramics lover"—ChatGPT displays relevant products from across the web. For items where Instant Checkout is enabled, users see a "Buy" button that lets them complete the entire transaction within the chat. The technical foundation is the Agentic Commerce Protocol, an open-source standard co-developed with Stripe that OpenAI is making available to any merchant or developer. This protocol creates a secure payment framework where ChatGPT acts as the user's AI agent, passing information between customer and merchant while the merchant retains full control as the merchant of record. Merchants handle orders, process payments through their existing systems (Stripe or otherwise), manage fulfillment and own the customer relationship post-purchase. Currently supporting single-item purchases for U.S. users of the Plus, Pro, and Free tiers, OpenAI plans to expand to multi-item carts and additional regions. The company emphasizes that product recommendations are organic and unsponsored, ranked purely by relevance, with merchants paying a small transaction fee on completed purchases. For customers, the service is free and doesn't affect product prices. ChatGPT Plus and Pro subscribers can leverage saved payment methods and shipping details for even faster checkout, though all users must explicitly confirm each step before purchase. This represents OpenAI's first major move toward what they call "agentic commerce"—a platform where AI doesn't just help you find products but actively facilitates purchasing them on your behalf, with the long-term vision of more autonomous shopping experiences. Related Article: Agentic AI and the Future of Customer Support: What CX Leaders Need to Know Ecommerce has long been a goal of every digital platform, from the leaders of internet browsers to social media platforms. Yet the customer journey of most ecommerce attempts often includes friction points for customers to complete a purchase: multiple browser tabs and re-entering payment information, all while having users create an account, can lead to abandoned carts. Many experts had hoped social commerce – retail through social media – would minimize the friction points. The volume of US social commerce did rise, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. The rise of direct-to-customer retail placed a spotlight on aligning click-through behavior and sales, creating high interest in a cart checkout with just a few clicks. OpenAI's launch of Instant Checkout approaches a speedy checkout with a "chat to checkout in just a few taps." Here's how Instant Checkout works: A customer asks ChatGPT for "gifts for a ceramics lover," receives curated product recommendations, sees a "Buy" button on items with Instant Checkout enabled, and completes the purchase without ever leaving the conversation. For ChatGPT Plus and Pro subscribers, the platform can prefill shipping and payment details, making the experience even more seamless. This level of convenience raises the digital customer experience bar significantly. If customers can complete a purchase in seconds through conversational AI, they'll increasingly expect similarly frictionless experiences everywhere else. Retailers who maintain clunky checkout processes will feel the comparison acutely. One of the most significant customer experience implications involves trust and transparency. OpenAI emphasizes that product results are "organic and unsponsored, ranked purely on relevance to the user," and that Instant Checkout availability doesn't influence product rankings. When multiple merchants sell the same product, ChatGPT considers availability, price, quality, primary seller status and Instant Checkout availability to optimize user experience. One potential shift for customers is the kinds of trust signals to look while shopping online. Customers have spent years learning which search results, sponsored placements and algorithmic recommendations to trust. They know when they're being marketed to. Conversational AI collapses those visual cues. There's no "Ad" label or comparison shopping pages, verifying that you're seeing the best options. For CX professionals, this creates a paradox. The experience feels more personal and helpful—like getting advice from a knowledgeable friend—but the mechanisms driving recommendations remain opaque. OpenAI's commitment to relevance-based ranking is important, but maintaining customer trust will require ongoing transparency about how these decisions are made. Unlike marketplace models where the platform intermediates the customer relationship, OpenAI positions itself as the customer's "AI agent—securely passing information between user and merchant, just like a digital personal shopper would." Merchants remain the merchant of record, handling orders, payments, fulfillment and customer support through their existing systems. This architectural choice has profound CX implications. When issues arise—damaged goods, shipping delays, return requests—customers must navigate the merchant's existing support infrastructure. They can't simply resolve everything in ChatGPT. OpenAI explicitly states that "merchants use your order information to complete the order, but OpenAI asks merchants to not sign users up for marketing emails from their ChatGPT orders." This creates a potential friction point. Customers who complete purchases in a conversational environment may expect conversational support. They'll ask ChatGPT about order status, return policies or replacement requests. While ChatGPT can surface information, the actual resolution still requires engaging with the merchant directly. For retailers, this means your post-purchase CX needs to match the seamlessness of the purchasing experience. If ChatGPT makes buying easy but your support remains difficult, the disconnect will be glaring. ChatGPT's existing features—Memory, Custom Instructions and conversation history—create opportunities for deeply personalized commerce experiences. The platform can remember that you prefer sustainable products, have a specific budget range, or are shopping for someone with particular interests. This contextual awareness enables product recommendations that feel genuinely helpful rather than algorithmically generic. For customer experience strategy, this represents a shift from session-based commerce to persistent relationship commerce. Instead of starting fresh with each visit, customers maintain an ongoing dialogue where preferences, constraints and needs are already understood. It's the digital equivalent of shopping with a personal stylist who remembers your taste, size and budget. However, this also requires rethinking privacy and consent. OpenAI notes that "to respond to your shopping question, ChatGPT uses your query and available context (such as Memory or Custom instructions)." Customers may not fully grasp how much information they're sharing through casual conversation or how it's being used to shape recommendations. Related Article: Humans Put ChatGPT Customer Experience Outcomes to the Test Currently, Instant Checkout supports single-item purchases only. OpenAI plans to add multi-item carts and expand merchant and regional availability. But the real customer experience transformation lies in what OpenAI calls "agentic commerce"—where AI doesn't just help you find what to buy but actually makes purchases on your behalf. Imagine asking ChatGPT to "stock my pantry with staples I usually buy" or "replace my worn-out workout clothes with similar items" and having it autonomously complete those purchases based on your preferences, budget and past behavior. OpenAI emphasizes that "users stay in control—they explicitly confirm each step before any action is taken," but it's easy to see how this could evolve toward greater autonomy. From a CX perspective, this promises ultimate convenience but introduces new anxieties. What happens when the AI makes a wrong assumption? How do you dispute an order you didn't manually approve? What safeguards prevent accidental purchases during casual conversation? These aren't theoretical concerns—they're fundamental customer experience challenges that will need addressing as agentic commerce matures. Traditional ecommerce has maintained a clear separation between discovery (search engines, social media, content sites) and purchase (retailer websites, marketplaces). ChatGPT collapses this continuum entirely. The same conversation that starts with "how do I decorate a small apartment" can seamlessly transition to purchasing specific furniture pieces without the customer ever consciously entering "shopping mode." This fluidity creates immense convenience but also removes traditional decision-making waypoints. In conventional ecommerce, the journey from discovery to checkout includes multiple opportunities for price comparison, reading reviews and specification verification. Conversational commerce compresses these steps, potentially reducing buyer confidence even as it increases convenience. Savvy retailers will need to ensure their product information, reviews and trust signals are accessible within conversational contexts. If ChatGPT recommends your product, customers should still be able to access detailed specifications quickly, customer reviews, return policies and other information that builds purchase confidence. Actions ecommerce and CX professionals can take to prepare for conversational commerce. OpenAI's move follows a broader trend of commerce functionality migrating to conversational interfaces powered by AI. Meta has been experimenting with business messaging on WhatsApp and Instagram. Google has integrated shopping into search results, hoping to further leverage its AI Overview integration with its search engine. But OpenAI's approach—combining product discovery, recommendation and checkout entirely within a conversational AI interface—represents the most complete implementation yet. OpenAI’s decision to open-source the Agentic Commerce Protocol suggests ecosystem ambitions. By creating a standard that works across AI platforms and payment processors, OpenAI is positioning conversational commerce as infrastructure, not just a ChatGPT feature. Marketing professionals must monitor adoption of conversational commerce as an element of marketing strategies and campaigns. Moreover, competitors who are still finding their AI strategy will see the Agentic Commerce Protocol as a significant competitor. Amazon, for example, has long offered shopping capabilities with Alexa. But partners in the Alexa ecosystem may move toward Open AI if Amazon does not launch a similar AI protocol for Alexa. Traditional ecommerce metrics—bounce rate, cart abandonment, time on site—don't translate cleanly to conversational commerce. New ways to measure engagement, conversion and satisfaction when shopping happens inside AI conversations. These metrics will help retailers understand whether conversational commerce delivers genuine CX improvements or simply novelty-driven early adoption. OpenAI's Instant Checkout raises as many customer experience questions as it answers: How will product returns work when the purchase was made conversationally? Can customers modify orders placed through ChatGPT? What happens when products are out of stock after ChatGPT recommends them? How do subscription services and recurring purchases translate to conversational commerce? What safeguards prevent accidental purchases during ambiguous conversations? These implementation details are fundamental to whether conversational commerce is a fit for the seamless customer experience being sought. Marketers should consider whether the answers mean achieving the promised experiences or are an indicator of implementation frustrations. Learn how you can join our contributor community.

Elon Musk's massive Tesla pay package could see him earn billions without achieving revolutionary goals. Experts suggest easier targets, like modest vehicle sales and vague product definitions, could net him tens of billions. While the board claims the package is performance-based, an analysis reveals potential payouts far exceeding ambitious milestones, raising questions about true accountability.

Title: Six Mag 7 Stocks Failed To Hit New Highs Wednesday As Indexes Did So

ByJohn Navin, Contributor. That these Mag 7 stocks could not make it up to new highs while the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 hit their new highs is peculiar. It’s the type of negative divergence that probably attracts the attention of Wall Street algorithms designed to be on the lookout for such things and to react according to their highly attuned programming. Alphabet The stock hit a peak of $255 in mid-September, sold off, rallied briefly and now trades for $244. No new high. The upward angle of the 50-day moving average is unusually strong. Today’s close is far above the 200-day moving average. The price-earnings ratio is 34. Alphabet has a market capitalization of $2401.95. Amazon The stock peaked in February at just above $240 (not seen on this chart). The early September re-test of that level failed. Today’s closing price was just above $220, just under the 50-day moving average. It appears as if Amazon has now tested the level of the 200-day moving average and managed to remain above it. The price-earnings ratio is 34. Market cap is $2401.95 billion. Broadcom The semiconducter giant hit a high of near $370 in early September. Today’s price closed the session at $345. It’s a sign of some weakness that Broadcom is unable to make it up to the old high on a day when the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 both hit new highs. Broadcom’s market cap is $1631.58 billion. The price-earnings ratio is 88. Meta The peak at near $800 arrived in August and the stock now goes for $717. An attempted retest of the previous high came in mid-September and failed. Meta Platforms now has nine closing days below the 50-day moving average. Mark Zuckerberg’s internet content company has a market cap of $1803.19 billion. The price-earnings ratio is 26. Netflix The stock peaked in late June up there just above $1325 and has since declined to today’s closing price of $1214. It seems to be magnetized since early August to the 50-day moving average. Netflix has a market cap of $515.97 billion. The price-earnings ratio is 51.74. Tesla The stock peaked on the first day of October at $470 and today closed at $438 – no new high here for CEO Elon Musk and friends. The 50-day moving average in September crossed above the 200-day moving average, so there’s that. Whether the momentum can be regained remains to be seen. Market cap is $1458.71 billion. The price-earnings ratio is 254. For comparison’s sake, here are the daily price charts for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 aka “the major indexes:” S&P 500 It’s a new high today, just barely. The peak is a bit clearer on the hourly chart, but it’s definitely there. Nasdaq 100 Today’s new high here is clear as a bell. Apple is the one Mag 7 name that managed a new high today.
