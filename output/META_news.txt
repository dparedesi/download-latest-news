Skip to comments. Posted on 06/26/2025 9:11:06 AM PDT by delta7 Former Wall Street money manager and financial analyst Ed Dowd of PhinanceTechnologies.com has been forecasting “Danger of Deep Worldwide Recession in 2025.” It looks like his thesis is turning out correct. He predicted interest rates would be declining. They did. And inflation has been going down right along with the economy as illegal immigration was being stopped and deportations ramped up. Dowd says, “Our friend Joe Biden spent anywhere between $500 billion to $2 trillion to bring these people in and set them up. Now, that’s all going the wrong way. Trump has shut down the border crossings, and as deportations heat up, that will only add to the problem. There will be a lot of supply, and prices have already started coming down in certain regions, and that is going to accelerate. Inflation is going to be coming down. Chairman Powell is dead-ass wrong. Tariffs are actually deflationary, and he’s holding rates higher for longer. That is going to end up being a big policy error. We think interest rates have peaked for the year. . .. We think the Fed will be forced to cut rates when the hard data comes in the wrong way.” What is Dowd looking at most? Dowd says, “If we did have an oil shock, our thesis of a deep world-wide recession would trigger even faster. During the last twelve days of this Iran/Israel war, I said to my followers, I am watching one thing and one thing only, and that is the price of oil. The price of oil did go up . . . I said if oil breaks out above $80 per barrel, then we’ve got problems. Oil has collapsed, and the oil markets are telling you the Iranians are not going to close the Strait of Hormuz. So, for now, the economies of the world are not going to be experiencing an oil price shock.” That does not mean we are set for clear sailing throughout 2025. Dowd is forecasting that commercial and residential real estate will be a huge drag on the economy as prices fall and fall hard. Dowd says, “We think shelter is going to trend lower, and there is going to be a deflationary scare coming.” Dowd thinks the Fed will panic and have emergency rate cuts this fall. The stock market will take some big hits. Dowd says, “I think they freak out in the fall in October or November. . .. I will point out airlines have taken out previous lows, homebuilders are weak, the DOW Jones transports are not close to all-time highs. The real economy is rolling over. Typically, when bubbles like this end, everyone is on the wrong side of the trade, and it’s going to happen quick. . .. Warren Buffett is telling you everything you need to know about this market.” Buffett has reportedly $350 billion in cash on the sidelines. Dowd favors gold because the big banks like gold. Dowd says, “Gold counts as a quasi-asset because it is a Tier 1 asset. That means they can create loans against that as an asset whereas before you couldn’t. It was not Tier 1. This is going to be misunderstood by a lot of people, and gold is now a big deal again. . .. If I am a long-term investor, I am going to do what the banks are doing. They have made gold money again. So, gold is money good . . . I am going to go with what the banks are buying.” Dowd wrote a popular book called “Cause Unknown,” which tracked the deaths and injuries that started after the CV19 vax rollout in 2021. He’s still tracking the injuries that just added another 700,000 disabled people. Since the CV19 injections started, that’s a hit a new high of 5.5 million permanently disabled Americans. Dowd says, “This looks like a bullish trend that isn’t stopping anytime soon. It goes up to a new high, consolidates and breaks out again. If this was a growth stock, I’d be all over it, and I’d be long disability. . .. the meta data, the big data, says something drastically changed in 2021. It’s a disaster. I think it’s the CV19 vaccine. I find it interesting there is no curiosity about this even with the new administration. It’s an elephant in the room, and they don’t want to talk about it.” There is much more in the 46-minute interview.

Dowd says, “Gold counts as a quasi-asset because it is a Tier 1 asset. That means they can create loans against that as an asset whereas before you couldn’t. It was not Tier 1. This is going to be misunderstood by a lot of people, and gold is now a big deal again. . .. If I am a long-term investor, I am going to do what the banks are doing. They have made gold money again. So, gold is money good . . . I am going to go with what the banks are buying.” Dowd wrote a popular book called “Cause Unknown,” which tracked the deaths and injuries that started after the CV19 vax rollout in 2021. He’s still tracking the injuries that just added another 700,000 disabled people. Since the CV19 injections started, that’s a hit a new high of 5.5 million permanently disabled Americans. Dowd says, “This looks like a bullish trend that isn’t stopping anytime soon. It goes up to a new high, consolidates and breaks out again. If this was a growth stock, I’d be all over it, and I’d be long disability. . .. the meta data, the big data, says something drastically changed in 2021. It’s a disaster. I think it’s the CV19 vaccine. I find it interesting there is no curiosity about this even with the new administration.

Kay and Marco Migueis Ex-ante cost-benefit analyses and other impact assessments are now a standard part of the rulemaking process. Yet some important effects of regulation are difficultâor impossibleâto assess before a rule takes effect. In such cases, ex-post (or retrospective) evaluation, conducted after a rule is in effect, offers an opportunity to measure real-world outcomes that could not reliably be predicted in advance. Such an evaluation can help determine whether a rule achieves its intended goals, whether the imposed costs are justified, and whether any unintended consequences have emerged. However, when rules are not designed with ex-post evaluation in mind, measuring certain impacts may be difficult or impossible in practice. This article discusses options to revise the rulemaking process to avoid this problem. Designing rules with ex-post evaluation in mind would facilitate such evaluations, ultimately leading to better rules. One rationale for evaluating rules is that they can impose costs on the public. To promote efficiency and minimize unintended harm, policymakers may prefer rules that are simple where complexity is unnecessary, inexpensive where high costs can be avoided, and designed to avoid adverse side effects. Recognizing these tradeoffs, the U.S. Congress has required federal agencies to conduct impact analyses for certain rulemakings.2 In addition, a standing executive order mandates that agencies perform cost-and-benefit analyses before issuing major new rules.3, 4 The ex-ante assessments help ensure that regulatory costs are justified and prevent some of the least cost-effective rules from being implemented. However, rules can prove more costly, yield fewer benefits, and produce more undesirable consequences than analysts anticipate in ex-ante assessments. These estimates are inherently uncertain, as they depend on future economic conditions and the reactions of regulated entities. Moreover, behavioral and political factorsâsuch as bureaucratic optimism (Krause and Corder, 2007; Liu, Stoutenborough, and Vedlitz, 2016), ideologically motivated policymaking (Hogwood and Gunn, 1984; Prendergast, 2007), and regulatory capture by special interests (Dal Bo, 2006)âcan cause analysts to overestimate the net benefits of new rules. Current U.S. executive branch policy requires agencies to conduct retrospective analyses to support the periodic review of regulations.5 Similarly, an executive order issued by President Obama encourages independent agencies to conduct retrospective analysisâa recommendation that remains in effect.6 In addition, Section 610 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act mandates that federal agencies periodically review regulations that have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Banking regulators are also required to regularly perform a systematic review of their regulations under the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act (EGRPRA). While these motivations for ex-post evaluation are evergreen, interest in such evaluations has grown in response to legal and political shifts over the past decade. During the first Trump administration, Executive Order 13771 (2017) required that "â¦any new incremental costs associated with new regulations shall, to the extent permitted by law, be offset by the elimination of existing costs associated with at least two prior regulations." Although the executive order was rescinded during the Biden administration, that rescission was itself reversed in the second Trump administration.7 Executive Order 14192 now requires that the "â¦total incremental cost of all new regulations, including repealed regulations, being finalized this year, shall be significantly less than zero."8 For policymakers aiming to meet such cost-reduction mandates, ex-post evaluation may help quantify regulatory cost changes and track progress toward aggregate cost targets. Further contributing to a changing policy environment, oversight bodies are increasingly pressing federal agencies to provide stronger analytic justification for their rules. For example, guidance from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) instructs agencies to quantify the total incremental costs or savings of each new and repealed significant regulatory action or guidance document.9 The instructions in this guidance amount to establishing a regulatory cost budget for each agency. If agencies are expected to meet cost targets for new rules, they may be incentivized to identify regulations with high costs and low benefits to repeal or replace. Because retrospective evaluations often yield more accurate estimates of realized costs than ex-ante projections, they can be useful in quantifying current burdens and informing regulatory cost budgeting. Separate from this recent guidance on regulatory cost budgets, the OMB has historically encouraged agencies to plan for ex-post review of regulatory outcomes. In its 2017 annual report to Congress, OMB's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) advised that "Rules should be written and designed to facilitate retrospective analysis of their effects, including consideration of the data that will be needed for future evaluation of the rules' ex-post costs and benefits."10â The currently effective OMB Circular A-4 (2003) similarly supports using retrospective analysis to assess whether a regulation's costs have changed after implementation. The now-rescinded 2023 version of Circular A-4 went further, stating that "â¦agencies may consider the benefits and costs of regulatory alternatives that would facilitate data collection to support future analyses or retrospective review. These alternatives may be especially valuable if there are significant uncertainties about benefits or costs, or if benefits or costs may change over time." In practice, agencies are expected to estimate a rule's costs and benefits before issuance and, in some cases, to design regulations in ways that facilitate later evaluation of their realized impacts. When agencies seek to support their rules with empirical evidence in legal proceedings, ex-post analyses can help demonstrate whether predicted benefits and costs materialized. The need to defend regulations in court may be growing. Two Supreme Court decisions in 2024 significantly increased the legal risks for federal rulemaking. In Corner Post, the Court held that the six-year statute of limitations under the Administrative Procedure Act begins when a regulated party is first subject to the rule, rather than when the rule is finalized, which had been the prior interpretation. In Loper Bright, the Court overturned the Chevron doctrine, which had required courts to defer to reasonable agency interpretations of ambiguous statutes. This decision shifted interpretive authority from agencies to the judiciary and may lead to greater scrutiny in litigation. While these are only two among many legal risks agencies face, ex-post evaluation may strengthen a rule's legal defensibility by providing evidence that its benefits outweigh its costs. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) has consistently emphasized the importance of retrospective review in strengthening regulatory quality. In reports from 2007, 2014, and 2018, the GAO called for expanding or improving the use of ex-post evaluation across federal agencies.11 Despite such calls, challenges persist. For example, a 2024 GAO review of independent federal financial regulators found that they had conducted few retrospective reviews of their existing rules.12 Finally, some policymakers may view ex-post evaluation as a tool to promote public trust in the government. Demonstrating that regulatory decisions are reviewed and evidence-based can signal accountability and responsiveness. Research suggests that transparency, such as disclosing government performance, can positively influence citizens' perceptions of government.13 When conducted, ex-post evaluations can help identify rules that are underperforming or no longer justified. In some cases, this evidence may support repeal. In others, evidence of strong performance and low costs could justify expanding a rule's scope: for example, by extending it to additional firms, increasing its stringency, or replacing alternative policies based on demonstrated effectiveness. This article proposes strategies to improve the government's capacity to conduct meaningful ex-post evaluations, supporting such analysis in contexts where policymakers choose to pursue it.14 While ex-post evaluations are incredibly valuable for improving the regulatory environment, conducting them can be difficult. Key challenges include identifying an appropriate counterfactual, gathering data on outcomes, and attributing these outcomes to the rule itself. Fortunately, these challenges can be mitigated when regulations are designed and implemented with evaluation in mind. The sections that follow explore organizational and implementation choices that can support ex-post evaluation.15 Staffing rulemakings with an eye toward ex-post evaluation Ex-post evaluation benefits from the early involvement of evaluation staff in the rulemaking process. Such staff can help identify opportunities to design rules in ways that support future evaluation. The marginal costs of such an assignment are likely to be modest. Under current practices, evaluation staff are often already engaged in the rulemaking processâmaking suggestions to reduce burdens and increase benefits. Asking them to also identify opportunities to support ex-post evaluation is unlikely to add significant cost. However, embedding economic analysis staff in the rulemaking process poses tradeoffs. Their economic expertise can improve the quality of rules, but their participation may also reduce the independence of the evaluation process from policy development. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) mitigates this issue by assigning different cost-benefit analysts participate to the drafting and evaluation phases of a ruleâan approach that requires more personnel and increases agency costs.16 But staff responsible for ex-ante impact analysis are often already engaged in the rulemaking process. Asking them to identify opportunities to support ex-post evaluation is unlikely to further reduce their independence. Therefore, the incremental cost of this added responsibility is likely modest, particularly when compared with the broader compliance costs and regulatory burdens of major regulations. To the extent that designing for ex-post evaluation leads to more such evaluations being conducted, costs may rise relative to the current baseline, where formal ex-post analyses are relatively uncommon. However, the cost of conducting these evaluations is typically modest compared to the potential benefitsâsuch as improving the efficacy and efficiency of existing rules. Moreover, by designing rules to support evaluation, agencies may create natural experiments that external researchers can study at no additional cost to taxpayers. In some cases, this could reduce the incremental cost of evaluation to nearly zero. Policymakers should weigh these cost considerations alongside the potential political, procedural, and reputational benefits of ex-post evaluations. Differentiated implementation and application of rules Ex-post evaluation can be facilitated by differentiated application of rules across similar firms. Applying different rules to otherwise comparable entities creates natural treatment and control groups, improving the ability to identify regulatory effects.17 Two commonly used forms of differentiation that support such analyses are: (1) tiered application of rules based on firm size or other relevant criteria and (2) staggered implementation.18 In addition, while pure randomization of regulatory policies across firms is uncommon and poses several challenges, it has been used in public policy and will be discussed at the end of this section. Many regulations apply only to firms that exceed a certain threshold of activity, leaving firms below that threshold exempt.19 This tiered approach can be appropriate because imposing stricter requirements on to certain entities, such as those that are larger and more complex, often yields greater benefits than applying the same rules to other entities.20 Also, regulatory compliance costs tend to increase less than proportionally with activity levels (Brock and Evans, 1985).21 However, tiering can also create incentives for firms to remain below regulatory thresholds to avoid compliance costs, which may discourage growth and reduce economic efficiency.22 In addition to these potential costs and benefits, tiering enables regulators to compare outcomes between firms above and below the threshold, helping to identify the effects of regulation. Ex-post analyses that utilize regulatory thresholds have provided valuable insights into the effects of financial regulations. Examples include Acharya et al. (2018), who found that the introduction of stress testing for large banks led to reductions in credit to risky borrowers; Kay et al. (2014), who found that banks subject to the Durbin amendment experienced substantial declines in interchange income relative to exempt banks, though they offset more than 90 percent of the lost income through higher deposit fees);23 Alvero, Ando, Xiao (2023), who used bunching of banks around Dodd-Frank size thresholds to estimate the costs of the act's regulatory burdens; Bindal et al. (2017), who studied the effects of the $10 billion and $50 billion thresholds that trigger increased bank merger scrutiny; and Wood (2023), who examined how the 2005 amendments to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act and the Community Reinvestment Act affected bank liquidity creation. In addition, many studies use regulatory thresholds to evaluate non-financial regulations.24 These examples demonstrate that ex-post evaluation can provide insights at a limited marginal cost when rules apply differently across otherwise comparable firms. Using tiered thresholds to identify the effects of regulations typically presents several challenges. Ideally, policy implementation would be unanticipated, preventing firms from strategically adjusting their behavior to remain out of scopeâbut this is rarely the case in practice. Still, reducing activity to avoid regulation can be costly, limiting firms' ability to respond.25 And while firms may have some discretion in staying above or below a threshold, ex-post comparisons between those either side of the cutoff can still shed light on how rules affect firm behavior and incentives. Even when firms do not strategically avoid regulatory thresholds, anticipation effects may arise as firms adjust behavior well before formal implementation, in response to rules they expect to face because of speeches, draft proposals, investor pressure, or other signals. Such adjustments are especially likely when compliance is complex, time-consuming, and costly. A firm may also adjust in response to rules that currently apply only to others, anticipating that similar requirements will extend to them in the future. These dynamics complicate causal inference by blurring the timing of firm responses. A related phenomenon is the announcement effect, in which other entities respond immediately when information about rules is publicly disclosed. For instance, securities prices may adjust on the day a regulation is announced, regardless of when it takes effect. Both types of effects can complicate causal inference by shifting behavior away from the formal implementation date, but they differ in timing, observability, and the clarity of the policy signal that drives the response. Another challenge in using tiered requirements to identify policy effects is that certain thresholds trigger multiple regulations simultaneously. For example, under the Dodd-Frank Act, crossing the $50 billion asset threshold subjects banks to several prudential standards, including enhanced stress testing, liquidity, and risk management requirements.26 Because these requirements were implemented concurrently, isolating their individual effects is difficult. Nevertheless, even when multiple rules are triggered at once, comparing firms above and below the threshold can provide useful insightsâespecially when estimating the most direct and distinct effects of a requirement, such as the impact of liquidity rules on holdings of high-quality liquid assets. In addition, when new requirements are layered onto an existing threshold, it may be possible to identify their marginal impact if the new rule was not anticipated at the time threshold was originally introduced. For example, while the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act established prudential liquidity requirements for large firms, a key element of the liquidity frameworkâthe net stable funding ratioâwas proposed in 2016, finalized in February 2021, and become effective in July 2021. Tiered application of regulations can support a long-term strategy of expanding regulations that demonstrate positive net benefits and scaling back or eliminating those that do not. Policymakers can (1) apply a rule initially to a narrow set of firms, (2) conduct an ex-post evaluation of the rule's costs and benefits, and (3) adjust the scope of the rule based on the findings.27 Arguably, certain expansions of banking requirements have followed this pattern. For instance, the long-term debt requirement for large banking organizations proposed in 2023 was influenced by the perceived successes of similar mandates for global systemically important banks introduced in 2016.28 Still, regulators could benefit from applying this approach more consistently, regularly reassessing whether to expand or narrow regulations in response to ex-post evidence. Staggered implementation, whether based on predetermined criteria or random assignment, is another common feature of rules that can support ex-post evaluation.29 Like tiering, applying a rule to similar firms at different times enables comparisons between early and late adopters, helping to assess a rule's impact. Therefore, regulators may benefit from using staggered implementation more often to evaluate the effectiveness of new policies. In some cases, staggered implementation has been deliberately designed to test policy effects. For instance, the SEC used staggered rollout in 2000 to evaluate the decimalization of stock market prices in 2000, and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) employed a staggered approach to distribute stimulus payments during the Great Recession.30, 31 Thanks to these clever implementation strategies, we now know far more about the consequences of these policies.32 In other cases, staggering implementation has resulted from practical considerations, such as prioritizing the most relevant entities or varying levels of readiness. For example, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority's (FINRA) Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (TRACE), mandated by the SEC for broker-dealer trade reporting, was initially introduced in 2002 for investment grade corporate bonds with large issuances. Over time, its scope was expanded to cover a broader range of securities, including those with smaller issuances and lower liquidity. This gradual rollout enabled researchers to assess TRACE's effects by comparing securities subject to the requirement with those that remained exempt.33 Staggered implementation has also enabled policy evaluation in cases where the staggering was not intended for that purpose. For example, Bremer and Sommer (2025) evaluated the costs and benefits of the European emission trading regime using incidental variation in implementation timing. Similarly, Barreca, Neidell, and Sanders (2021) used staggered rollout to estimate the benefits of the U.S. Acid Rain Program. Comparable setups exist in U.S. policies on long-term care staffing and overtime protections, but, to our knowledge, no ex-post evaluations have yet exploited this variation.34 Staggered implementation has also been employed in bank regulation and by quasi-regulatory organizations in the private sector. Notable examples include the current expected credit losses (CECL) accounting standard,35 stress-testing requirements for large banks,36 and the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR).37 These staggered rollouts have enabled valuable ex-post analyses. Some examples include Loudis et al. (2021), who assessed the impact of early CECL adoption during the COVID-19 stress and found that reserves were substantially more responsive to the economic outlook among early adopters; and Banerjee and Mio (2018), who examined the staggered rollout of liquidity regulation in the UK and its effects on bank balance sheets. Staggered implementation also has limitations as a tool for policy evaluation. Because the units serving as controls are typically treated within a short time frame, often a year or two, analyses based on staggered rollout are more informative for short-term outcomes than for outcomes that depend on the long-term state of the regulation. For example, the decimalization of stock prices allowed researchers to assess impact on trading costs, which materialized quickly. By contrast, most banking regulations affect outcomes over longer horizons, and firms may begin adjusting their behavior in anticipation of rules before they take effect. Also, just as with identifying a regulation's effect through tiered application, possible anticipation and announcement effects limit how much staggered implementation can reveal about a regulation's true impact. For these reasons, evaluations based on staggered implementation require caution in interpreting results and modesty about the strength and generalizability of their findings. Although the staggered implementations of TRACE and CECL were not designed for evaluation purposes, they enabled valuable ex-post policy analysis. Like tiering, staggered implementation supports the evaluation of regulatory effectiveness and can inform iterative improvements. Problematic or costly implementations can be slowed or abandoned, while successful ones can be accelerated and expanded when early evidence indicates strong positive effects.38 A more modest alternative to randomized staggered implementation is the use of small-scale pilot programs, in which a regulation is applied, potentially on a voluntary basis, to a limited number of firms for a defined period. These pilots can reduce the cost of experimentation while providing useful comparisons between treated and untreated firms. The SEC has conducted several such pilots, including during the rollout of TRACE, the "up-tick" pilot (which removed a short-sale price test), and the "tick-size" pilot (which increased the minimum price increment for stocks from one to five cents). These experiments have generated multiple studies evaluating the effectiveness of the associated regulatory changes.39 However, the voluntary nature of many pilot programs can limit their value for casual inference (see Harris et al. (2021) for a discussion of these limitations in financial regulation). Beyond short-term randomized staggering, such as the decimalization of stock prices or the IRS stimulus payments, a long-term strategy for evidence-based regulation would involve more open-ended policy experiments using randomization.40 Randomly assigning treatments to comparable units remains the gold standard for identifying causal effects, which is why it has long been used in clinical trials. Experimental economics has similarly used controlled trials to explore economic questions in lab-like environments. Although fully controlled trials are rarely feasible in the context of firm regulation, regulators may still seek opportunities to adopt similar approaches where possible. Policy randomization can result in unequal treatment among regulated entities. Still, society accepts randomization in high-stakes decisionsâsuch as the military draft, jury selection, and clinical trialsâwhen randomization is grounded in ex-ante fairness.41, 42 Governments have also used randomization to evaluate the effectiveness of anti-poverty programs and the benefits of Medicare coverage.43 Credible evidence on policy effectiveness can require accepting some temporary inequities among regulated entities or individuals; this tradeoff may be justified when the resulting knowledge has the potential to substantially improve long-run outcomes. This does not mean that arbitrarily large inequities should be introduced solely for the sake of experimentation. Instead, the potential benefits of policy experimentation should be weighed against the potential costs associated with any resulting inequities. In general, policy randomization is more ex-ante justifiable when there is greater uncertainty about a policy's effects (including on the bottom line of regulated entities) and when the costs of unequal treatment are relatively low. Bank supervision is one area where policy randomization could be used to learn more. Given that appropriate baseline levels of supervision are in place, the incremental costs and benefits of different supervisory approaches could be studied through randomized assignment. For example, supervisors could test the efficacy of varying examination frequencies, team sizes and compositions, triggers for examinations, or areas of focus. Over time, such experimentation could help regulatory agencies allocate their limited resources more efficiently. The socially optimal scope of a regulation may not align with the scope that best enables evaluation of its effects. While employing a suboptimal scope for the sake of evaluation may involve some theoretical cost, there is generally little empirical evidence that current scopes of application are optimally efficient. Therefore, experimentation with regulatory scope may be feasible without demonstrable loss of efficiency at the outset. Even with greater use of randomization, pilot programs, tiering, and staggering, ex-post evaluation can be difficult for certain policies. As discussed earlier, the application of multiple regulatory requirements at the same threshold can challenge efforts to isolate individual effects. These challenges highlight the importance of designing policies with evaluation in mind: by embedding variation in implementation, improving opportunities for measurement, and reducing overlap across rules. Still, in practice, stakeholders may struggle to agree on a structure that is both legally defensible and cost-effective while also supporting rigorous ex-post analysis. When policies are implemented in ways that preclude meaningful evaluation, more fundamental concerns arise, including ethical ones. For example, Campbell (1969) argued, "To be truly scientific we must be able to experiment. We must be able to advocate without that excess of commitment that blinds us to reality testing." Similarly, Boruch (1975) warned that, "[A] failure to discover whether a program is effective is unethical. Insofar as a failure to obtain unequivocal data on effects then leads to decisions which are wrong and ultimately damaging, that failure may violate good standards of both social and professional ethics." Or as Karl Popper put it, "â¦ we make progress, if and only if, we are prepared to learn from our mistakes: to recognize our errors and to utilize them critically instead of persevering in them dogmatically." (Popper 1957). Careful examination of policy effects helps ensure that government decisions are responsible, accountable, and guided by evidence. Dual reporting Identifying the costs and benefits of rules requires more than clear identification of treatment and control groupsâit also depends on having good data, a concern sometimes overlooked in the rule making process. For example, the definitions of capital and risk-weighted assets have changed several times since the Dodd-Frank Act. Yet regulatory reporting typically requires firms to provide data only under the latest definitions, making it difficult to measure whether changes in reported capital or assets reflect changes in behavior or shifts in definitions. New rules can avoid this issue by requiring firms to report data using both old and new definitions for a limited time. This approach is similar to how banks report the value of securities under both mark-to-market and amortized cost valuations. Such parallel data proved invaluable in understanding the banking problems that emerged in March 2023, helping regulators identify banks with significant unrealized losses from interest rates changes that were not reflected in regulatory capital. Similarly, when revising questions in its Current Population Survey, the Census Bureau asks the old and new versions of a question to maintain consistency and data usability over time.44 Dual reporting can also be useful when the scope of a rule is being narrowed. Maintaining data from firms that were previously covered can help evaluate whether regulatory simplifications and burden reductions achieve their intended outcomes. Failing to collect overlapping data often creates problems. Famously, the Census Bureau changed its annual health insurance survey at the same time the Affordable Care Act was implemented, making it much harder to evaluate the law through ex-post analysis.45 Another example was the Bureau of Labor Statistics' 1994 introduction of the concept of discouraged workers and other major changes to the U-4 through U-6 unemployment measures.46 These changes made comparisons with earlier data more difficult and complicated analysis of laws such as the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 and the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. Dual reporting would temporarily raise compliance costs. Still, when reporting under old definitions can rely on existing systems, the marginal costs may be low. In such cases, the potential benefits of dual reporting are likely to outweigh the costs. Effective ex-post evaluation of rules can offer substantial benefits. This paper outlines two rule design strategies to support such evaluation. First, expanding the use of tiering, randomization, and staggered implementation can improve the identification of a rule's effects by creating treatment and control groups. Table 1 illustrates several applications of these techniques in public policy, showcasing how they can yield insights across a range of settings. Second, dual-reporting requirementsâwhere both new and legacy data are collected during a transitional windowâhelp distinguish the true effects of rules from changes in measurement. In addition, analysts tasked with ex-post evaluation could be brought into the rulemaking process early to help identify ways to enable meaningful evaluation. Once designing rules for ex-post evaluation becomes standard practice, policymakers and researchers are likely to discover more tools to support it. With a broader toolkit, many more ex-post evaluations will become possible. Many have argued that policymakers may resist this approach, worrying they have more to lose by exposing poor performing policies than they have to gain from highlighting successful ones (Wolf, 1979; Hogwood and Gunn, 1984; Twight, 1991; Weiss, 1993; Rossi, 1987; Hanson, 2003; Prendergast, 2003; Prendergast, 2007; and Bovens, Hart, and Kuipers, 2009). Policymakers may also be concerned about the costs of ex-post evaluations or worry that designing for evaluation could slow down the rulemaking process, delaying public access to well-crafted policies. Still, the benefits of strengthening ex-post evaluation are worth serious consideration. The regulatory community has managed the discomforts of ex-ante impact analyses by normalizing them. Today, nearly every major rule includes such an analysis, offering valuable information to both policymakers and the public. Similarly, normalizing ex-post evaluation could reduce the stigma of admitting that some rules underperform, and in turn encourage more independent, timely, and accurate evaluations. Better ex-post evaluation would help the public understand the real impacts of government policyâand support reform or repeal of rules that fall short.

Two key laws here are the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 and the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995. The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires agencies to consider the impact of their rules on small entities. The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act requires agencies to assess the costs and benefits of any regulation that has a material impact on state, local, or tribal governments. Both laws define agencies according to Title 5, Section 551(1) of the US Code; however, the Regulatory Flexibility Act includes independent regulatory agencies, while the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act excludes them. Return to text 3.

Return to text 4. Historically these requirements did not apply to independent regulatory agencies. However, recently issued Executive Order No. 14215, 90 Federal Register 10447 (February 24, 2025) mandates that "â¦all executive departments and agencies, including so-called independent agencies, shall submit for review all proposed and final significant regulatory actions to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA)â¦" along with their cost-benefit analyses. OIRA traditionally reviews agency submissions of the potential costs and benefits of "significant" rules (Congressional Research Service, 2024). Return to text 5.

Alessandro, Cardinale, Lagomarsino, Scartascini, and Torrealday (2019) show that government transparency, and particularly transparency about government performance (e.g., implementing effective rules) promotes citizen confidence in government. In a metanalysis of 49 studies, Qiushi and Guan (2022) show that government transparency has a positive and significant effect on citizen trust in government. Return to text 14. See Herrick and Sarewitz (2000), Kovacic (2006), and de Jong et al. (2018) for a discussion of the benefits of ex-post evaluation of policies in the context of environmental policy, competition policy, and infrastructure projects, respectively. Return to text 15. The Department of Energy previously highlighted a related motivation, stating that it would "consider how regulations might be designed and written" to better support retrospective evaluation and measurement of outcomes (DOE 2011). Although DOE's subsequent actions regarding this specific goal are uncertain, our work explicitly advances this approach. Return to text 16. Even with this separation of drafting and analysis roles, both sets of analysts ultimately answer to SEC leadership. Skeptics could still justifiably worry about the analysts' independence when they have the same bosses. Return to text 17. The typical identification assumptions used in measuring the effects of regulations do not require that firms be "similar." Rather, the (partly non-testable) assumptions needed for causal identification are exchangeability (i.e., there is conditional mean independence of treatment and control units), positivity (i.e., the probability of a unit being treated is positive but below one), and stable unit treatment value (i.e., potential outcomes of each unit are unaffected by the treatment assignment of other units). Similarity of treated and control units is one way to satisfy these assumptions but is not necessary. A potential objection to using differentiated application of regulations to similar firms to identify treatment effects is that, by changing the conditions of competition across firms, introducing a regulation for a subset of firms can also affect outcomes for the non-treated firms â which would violate the stable unit treatment assumption. This is a potential limitation to consider when applying the identification methodologies discussed below. Return to text 18. Differentiated application of regulations is often mandated by statute. This article focuses on the ex-post evaluation of regulations issued by the executive branch agencies, but similar approaches can be followed by Congress to evaluate the effectiveness of statutes ex-post.

In the banking regulation context, regulations with thresholds of application abound (see Congressional Research Service (2017) for a listing of all the thresholds that were in place at that time). Several regulations include enhanced requirements for large firms, complex firms, or both, including capital, liquidity, and resolution requirements. Return to text 20. Large banking organizations tend to pose proportionally more systemic risk to the financial system than smaller banking organizations (see, for instance, Lorenc and Zhang (2020)). Return to text 21. Given the same regulatory requirements, a firm with $1 billion in activity may be able to use the same systemâand incur a similar absolute costâas a firm that performs $2 billion of the activity. Return to text 22. France imposes numerous regulations on firms once they employ 50 or more workers, resulting in an unusually high number of firms with exactly 49 employees. Such "bunching" has been estimated to reduce French aggregate productivity by 3.4 percent of gross domestic product (Garicano et al., 2016). Return to text 23. The Durbin amendment to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act requires the Federal Reserve to limit fees charged to retailers for credit card processing. Return to text 24. See, for example, Leonardi and Pica (2006) and Vaccro (2017). Return to text 25. For example, consider that the average domestic banking organization subject to Category III requirements had $550 billion in assets as of 2023:Q4. Given a typical return on assets of 1 percent, these banks would have to give up $3 billion in returns to be subject to Category IV requirements instead. Given observed growth in balance sheets, the current regulations have not caused banks to downsize in this way. Return to text 26. See Congressional Research Service (2017) and Labonte and Perkins (2017). The $50 billion threshold was generally increased to $250 billion in the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act of 2018. Return to text 27. See List (2024) for a discussion of how to optimally generate policy-relevant evidence before scaling an intervention. Return to text 28. See Federal Reserve System (2016) and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Reserve System, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (2023). Return to text 29. The idea of using staggered implementation for causal identification has long been a standard practice in policy analysis (Meyer, 1995). The earliest reference we know of calling for expanded use of staggering to promote policy evaluation is Leuz and Wysocki (2016). Return to text 30. Between August 2000 and January 2001, the New York Stock Exchange, in a series of incremental steps, began trading and quoting all its listed securities in increments of a penny. See SEC (2000) for additional details. Return to text 31. The primary component of the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 was a $100 billion program of economic stimulus using tax rebates. The IRS implementation of this stimulus was randomized based on the last two digits of the filer's Social Security number. See Parker et al. (2013) for details. Return to text 32. Chung et al. (2004) studied the staggered roll out of decimalization. The Nasdaq Stock Market and the New York Stock Exchange have also performed ex-post analyses of this policy. As predicted, these analyses found that decimal pricing reduced bid-ask spreads. There were concerns the rule would reduce market liquidity, but the analyses failed to find evidence that liquidity declined. Chung, Lee, and Rösch (2020) and Werner et al. (2022) look at a related policy experiment involving a stratified random sampling process that assigned different quote and trading price increments in 2016 called the tick size pilot program. Parker et al. (2013) studied the effect of the staggered IRS roll out of the economic stimulus payments of 2008. This paper helped establish the efficacy of fiscal stimulus spending, finding a marginal propensity to consume of 50 to 90 percent in the first three months after stimulus payments were received. These results imply that such payments are highly effective stimulus. Return to text 33. See Bessembinder et al. (2006) and Goldstein et al. (2007). Return to text 34. The 2024 CMS staffing rule for long-term care facilities phases in nurse staffing minimums across facilities at different times, based on geographic and facility-specific factors, allowing for future comparisons across rollout cohorts. Similarly, the Department of Labor's 2024 overtime rule raises salary thresholds in two steps, creating a time-based regression discontinuity that could support evaluation of labor market effects. To date, neither rule has been the subject of published ex-post evaluation exploiting this variation. Return to text 35. The CECL accounting standard was required for entities that meet the definition of an SEC filer as of January 2020, and all other entities were required to adopt CECL by January 2023 (see Financial Accounting Standards Board, 2016). Return to text 36. Stress tests were initially implemented for the largest 19 banks in 2009 (under the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program) and later extended to all banks with more than $50 billion in total assets in 2013, following on the statuary mandate from the Dodd-Frank Act; see Board of Governors (2009, 2013). Return to text 37. In an implementation that combines staggering and tiering, the LCR was initially introduced for the largest firms in 2015:Q1, and, later, a modified LCR was applied to a set of smaller yet large firms starting in 2016:Q1 (Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Reserve System, and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 2014). Return to text 38. This occasionally happens in medical trials where a treatment is so effective that the study is ended early over ethical concerns about denying potentially life-saving treatment to the control group. See Mueller, Montori, Bassler, Koenig, and Guyatt (2007) for a discussion of this issue. Return to text 39. See Harris et al. (2021) for a description of these and other pilot programs and for several references to studies that were based on these pilot programs. Return to text 40.

See Silverman and Chalmers (2001), Erikson and Stoker (2010), Gramlich (2017), and Weldon (2017) for a discussion of public perspectives on fairness in these contexts. Return to text 42. See Rawls (1971) for a discussion of the fairness of equality prior to resolution of uncertainty (i.e., being behind the veil of ignorance). Return to text 43. The Mexican anti-poverty program Progresa/Oportunidades was designed for evaluation using a randomized design. The ongoing program provides cash transfers to poor families based on school attendance and doctor visits (Parker and Todd, 2017). Due to lack of available funds to cover all eligible citizens, Oregon randomized who was covered by a Medicaid expansion in 2008, giving important insights actual benefits of government health insurance (Allen et al, 2010; DeVoe et al, 2015).

Title: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang begins sale of $925M worth of Nvidia stock — sale of 6 million shares barely dents his $123 billion in shares

How many leather jackets can this amount of money buy? When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The leather jacket-toting CEO sold 100,000 Nvidia shares last Friday and Monday, marking the start of a planned sale of up to six million shares announced in March of this year. The company’s stock price around that time hovered at $144.56 per share, meaning Mr. Huang just made nearly $15 million over the weekend. Nvidia recently hit a record stock price of $154.31, so the total sale, if the company’s stock price holds, is potentially valued at almost a billion dollars — $925,429,000 to be exact. Despite that massive amount, it is but a drop in the bucket as his estimated net worth is $135 billion, says CNBC, putting him at number 10 on the Forbes list of the world’s richest people (at least at the time of writing). This sale was planned months earlier with the Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, which helps avoid corporate insiders from being accused of insider trading. Huang’s timing is impeccable, though, as his stock sale started execution just as Nvidia’s value hit record highs. This also isn’t the first time that Nvidia’s C-suite has executed an 10b5-1 plan and benefited from its sky-high stock prices. Just last year, its executives and directors sold over $1.8 billion in Nvidia stock, with Jensen raking in $713 million in cash after selling six million shares — the same amount planned for this year. Despite those sales figures, Jensen still owns a substantial amount of Nvidia. According to the SEC filing, he still has over 75 million shares in his direct ownership, plus another 783,375,400 shares owned indirectly through trusts and LLCs. Aside from that, he also received $49.9 million last year in total compensation, which was higher than the $44 million he received in 2023. Nvidia’s massive growth happened within the last couple of years, when the AI boom propelled its stock price to the stratosphere. Its stock price hovered around $5 in the late 2010s, before jumping to around $25 to $30 in 2021 due to the GPU shortages. It dropped back down to $15 in late 2022 before skyrocketing in the years after that due to AI advancements. By late 2024, Nvidia overtook Apple as the world’s most valuable company, making it worth more than Amazon and Meta combined.

Bitcoin and crypto have rocketed higher over the last year, surging along with stock markets despite fears of a “Doomsday” scenario for the markets and the bitcoin price. Front-run Donald Trump, the White House and Wall Street by subscribing now to Forbes’ CryptoAsset & Blockchain Advisor where you can "uncover blockchain blockbusters poised for 1,000% plus gains!" The bitcoin price has soared back toward its all-time high of $112,000 per bitcoin, up around 50% from its April lows and helped by U.S. president Donald Trump surprising traders with a “massive” crypto prediction. Now, as the crypto market braces for a Congress game-changer predicted to “unleash” trillions, a legendary billionaire has said he expects global “de-dollarization" to catapult the bitcoin price to a $5 trillion market capitalization by 2030—putting it alongside technology giants Nvidia and Microsoft. Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex—A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run The "de-dollarisation of the world [and] the end of U.S. exceptionalism" has been named as the ... More driving force behind a huge $5 trillion bitcoin price prediction. Philippe Laffont, the billionaire founder of hedge fund Coatue Management, has added bitcoin to his Fantastic 40 list, a collection of investments he thinks will be the biggest winners over the next five years. Laffont’s list, which features Microsoft, Nvidia, bitcoin, Amazon and Meta as the top five and doesn't include tech giants Apple or Google at all, can be seen in full here. "I wake up every day at three in the morning and I’m like, 'why am I such an idiot? What have I been waiting for, not being involved in it?' And it just goes up and up," Laffont told CNBC, adding that, “sometimes you have to change your mind and you have to say, well, 'I made a mistake.'” According to Laffont, who claims he hasn't bought bitcoin yet, its price could more than double to give bitcoin a market capitalization of over $5 trillion by 2030, with Microsoft forecast to soar to $5.7 trillion and Nvidia to $5.6 trillion. "I always thought, bitcoin's amazing, but it's double or triple the volatility of the Nasdaq," Laffont said. "It seems its volatility as an asset class is coming down." Laffont pointed to the gold's $22 trillion market cap as justification for bitcoin's performance over the next few years, along with "the de-dollarisation of the world [and] the end of U.S. exceptionalism."

Title: AMD's AI Moment May Be Coming. Will It Seize It?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. INDONESIA - 2025/06/16: In this photo illustration, the AMD (Advanced Micro Devices) logo is seen ... More displayed on a smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Algi Febri Sugita/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Advanced Micro Devices stock (NASDAQ:AMD) rose nearly 7% during Tuesday trading and approximately 15% year-to-date, as investor confidence grows regarding its role in the AI chip market, with several analysts raising their price targets for the stock. So what exactly has shifted for AMD in recent months? The AI semiconductor industry is vast and continues to grow rapidly. Nvidia has a stronghold in the market and has more than doubled its revenue over the last two years, with the data center GPU market exceeding $100 billion annually. However, AMD does not need to surpass Nvidia to further enhance its stock—it simply needs to increase GPU sales, and an opportunity may be emerging. In the past three years, the AI market has been characterized by significant investments from major tech companies and hyperscalers aiming to create the most advanced frontier AI models. These organizations have focused on performance and training speed, as training large language models necessitates substantial computational resources. This trend has favored Nvidia, which produces the leading chips available and possesses a well-established hardware and software ecosystem among major cloud service providers. Nonetheless, there is a genuine possibility that the rapid enhancements in frontier AI models will eventually reach a plateau. A broader array of AI workloads will transition to inference—essentially applying the developed models to real-world scenarios—where efficiency and cost are more critical than sheer computing power. This situation could represent a chance for AMD. Not all organizations require or can afford Nvidia’s premium GPUs. Many may choose older Nvidia models or more budget-friendly alternatives like AMD’s MI series, which provide adequate memory and solid performance for inference and fine-tuning of models. Additionally, open-source models like Llama from Meta may enable more companies to run their AI workloads on-site, decreasing dependence on costly cloud computing fees. This could also benefit AMD. Meanwhile, Intel is attempting to stage a comeback Can Intel’s 18A Break TSMC’s 2nm Stronghold? At its AI Day event, AMD introduced its MI350 series, set to launch in the second half of 2025, which it claims will deliver four times the AI compute capacity of its predecessor. The company also provided a preview of its MI400 and MI450 chips, furthering its evolving product strategy. Beyond hardware, AMD is developing its AI software and systems stack, positioning itself as a comprehensive AI provider—through its acquisitions of Brium, focused on compiler and AI software optimization, and Enosemi, specializing in silicon photonics. These strategies could also bolster AMD’s ROCm software stack, which follows an open-source, standards-based methodology, contrasting with Nvidia’s proprietary CUDA environment. This could attract enterprises seeking flexibility and lower costs for large-scale AI deployment. AMD recently announced a partnership with Oracle to make its MI355X GPUs available through Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, offering over two times the price-performance advantage compared to previous generations for large-scale AI tasks including inferencing. Nevertheless, risks persist. Cloud providers such as Google and Amazon are developing their own custom AI chips, which could restrict long-term demand for third-party hardware solutions. Nvidia may also intensify focus on more efficient mid-tier chips as the market shifts toward inferencing. Refer to our analysis on AMD Valuation: Is AMD Stock Expensive Or Cheap? for additional insights regarding AMD’s valuation and its comparison with competitors. The significant rise in AMD stock may restrict its potential in the near to medium term. Alternatively, the Trefis Reinforced Value (RV) Portfolio, which has outperformed its all-cap stocks benchmark (a combination of the S&P 500, S&P mid-cap, and Russell 2000 benchmark indices), has produced impressive returns for investors. Why is that? The quarterly rebalanced mix of large-, mid-, and small-cap RV Portfolio stocks provides a proactive way to capitalize on favorable market conditions while limiting losses when the market declines, as discussed in RV Portfolio performance metrics.

We all want to do awesome things and make an impact at work. However, what we call “work” is a relationship between employer and employee that’s inherently and persistently designed to benefit the former over the latter. How do we meaningfully contribute, earn a living, and maybe even enjoy ourselves when the organization simply does not care about us? It’s harsh, but that’s captialism, baby! Any organization (“org”) exists for a purpose that’s greater than the individuals within it (e.g., profit, public service). We are a means to that end. Same goes for anything we personally get out of the arrangement be it salary, experience, foosball tables, or free lunches. This precarious and lopsided power dynamic manifests itself in our day-to-day in a variety of weird ways we often take for granted. Even if it never gets to something as extreme as layoffs or restructuring we still have to navigate this as best we can. We need to do our best work possible all while one tiny fact looms in the back of our minds. At the end of the day we’re just line items on somebody’s spreadsheet. One prevailing assumption that crumbles under the slightest scrutiny is that an org is a cohesive entity. We all know deep down it’s merely a collective made up of people, and yet we overlook this all the time. Heaven help us all if the company refers to itself as family. Ugh! If an employer ever says “We’re like a family here” what they mean is they’re going to ruin you psychologically The head of the collective—executive leadership—isn’t a single brain. It could be 3, 5, or 7 brains all trying to act like a cohesive unit. But if you personally had 7 brains inside your head how do you think you’d come across to others? Companies are not rational actors. Anything an org does is just an emergent property of humans trying to work together. Organizations, especially large ones, are not optimizing for complete or perfect decisions. They’re optimizing for as much alignment and consensus as they can get to keep moving (sometimes by fiat). By necessity these decisions will always be suboptimal and that will infuriate workers who care about what they do. Most of these decisions will not make sense because we can’t interpret a collective action as if it came from an individual. Rich Gilbert nails it in his great video “Caring Less About Work can get us what we really want”: If you’re going to work and and you’re getting frustrated and you’re intelligent and you’re looking around at all the dummies around that are not making the right decision, that is by design. We can plead, “How could they DO this?” or complain, “This is a dumb decision,” but executive leadership really is at arm’s length to us and our work. Leadership lacks the detail we regularly see in the course of our work and they’re dealing in the abstract. Actions from leadership will therefore often feel extreme, sudden, swift, half-baked, reactive, fickle, or temperamental. The ultimate effect is that the org doesn’t care about us. One could even argue that it cannot care about us. An org is operating on another plane of reality entirely. Whatever it “does” says nothing about the individuals along for the ride. We’re better off not trying to interpret its actions too closely, lest we break our brains. Most of the time Hanlon’s razor explains the dysfunction we see, but the nature of orgs can also provide temptation or cover for some willful disregard and gaslighting. A good example of gaslighting might be a lack of true upward mobility. Does the company promote often? Or does it say it will and then take forever to actually do it? How about raises—do they even happen and how are they calculated? Does the company promote from within or does it recruit a higher position with a new joiner? That’s the carrot, but the stick is far worse! We’re always on the chopping block whether we know it or not. Not even management or the CTO are safe. Layoffs are ever-present and come in several forms. If we’re unlucky enough to work somewhere that does stack ranking (e.g., Microsoft, Meta, Shopify) we can kinda sorta at least see it coming. Yay? Despite all evidence to the contrary CEOs absolutely love this shit. They definitely do not care who’s let go and for those who remain—until the next quarter—they don’t care about the paranoia or distrust it causes. When I interviewed at Meta, they had me do interviews with four engineers, seemingly chosen at random from within the company. The last guy had been there by far the longest. I asked him “What’s it like to work there?” and he said “Oh, working here will rewire your brain.” Maybe stack ranking is too cumbersome… Probably best to just do layoffs arbitrarily. The company doesn’t even need to be in trouble! Entirely profitable companies can do layoffs, often more than once and with impunity. It’s a great flex for shareholders—so trendy that the stock price might go down if CEOs don’t do it. WTF? As Anil Dash notes this is more than just cutting costs: Big tech CEOs and VCs really love performing for each other. We know they hang out in group chats like high schoolers, preening and sending each other texts, each trying to make sure they’re all wearing the latest fashions, whether it’s a gold chain or a MAGA hat or just repeating a phrase that they heard from another founder. The “return to office” push is another such trend. There’s no positive intepretation for it that has any basis in our post-2020 reality. Even supposing it’s not a “quiet layoff” it’s still not good. Executives continue to poke this bear—up to a full 5 days a week in a physical office—and when we go along with it then the org knows it can do almost anything it wants to us. And perhaps the darkest trend in recent times is the holy grail for CEOs—not hiring people in the first place. when a leader says human workers are a source of “bottlenecks”, and that automation is the source of “solutions”, pay very, very, very close attention If people think “AI” can meaningfully replace human developers, we’re in for a reckoning very soon. For one, we need junior developers and senior developers cannot exist in a vacuum. A generational talent gap is coming. For another, worsening software quality will erode and ruin companies. We’re left to ride this wave until orgs finally comprehend that developers do more than just produce code. Ahem, that last section got a little negative! However, a sober acknowledgment of the circumstances around us is the first step in loving our jobs. Yes, really. We can throw up our hands and lament that we’re just cogs in the machine, but I prefer to turn that idiom on its head a bit. It’s an apt metaphor. I’m just one gear of many. I have limited capabilities as do my neighbouring gears—I can rotate clockwise or counterclockwise. When I do something my neighbours react in turn, and vice versa. We come in different sizes and shapes resulting in differences in torque transmission, rotational speed, and so on. My direct neighbours are very obviously cooperating with me as our teeth are interlocking. Conversely, the further away a gear is from me the less direct, and evident, our influence on each other becomes. The overall machine from my point of view begins to act strangely, resists me, or jams up completely. This actual machine would certainly be useless if it were real. The point is there’s little sense in struggling over the distant cogs but there’s plenty to focus on right around us. The concentric circles of concern, influence, and control, popularized by Stephen Covey, is a famous framework for personal effectiveness and decision-making that translates extremely well to the context of an org. The org overall is our circle of concern—it completely surrounds us but is so far removed that we can only observe and adapt to it in relatively minor ways. What this means is we can put the overall organization and its shenanigans in the back of our minds while we optimize our local relationships and maximize our job satisfaction with real people and meaningful tasks. This is within our circle of influence. Namely, this is our manager, our reports, and our peers or teammates. We should figure out what our manager needs in order to perform their job and then become their ally towards those causes. This feedback loop builds trust very quickly and we’ll feel more empowered. Our boss also acts as a “canary in the coal mine”—if they’re comfortable in the org maybe we can be, too. Quick note: the advice above only works if our boss is a true leader and has our backs. If they’re driven by ego or more interested in licking executives’ boots, fuck 'em. If we ourselves have direct reports, then we practice servant leadership and put as much energy into these relationships as we can. Listen to them every day, figure out what they need, and collaborate with them on those actions. I know I became the leader I am today thanks to my reports. Obviously we spend most of our time with our fellow developers, designers, architects, QAs, product managers, analysts, and so on. These are the people, on a daily basis, that we want to impress and be impressed by. Ideally, they’re just plain fun to hang out with, too! Never underestimate how much job satisfaction can be derived from the mutual respect and admiration among people who like each other and are operating at the top of their game. This is the real company that we work for, as it were. It’s a subset of the overall org that we can readily interpret because none of it is abstract. It also means we don’t have to withdraw or disengage under the crushing weight of organizational nonsense. There will always be a venue where we can practice core principles—empathy, support, excellence, collaboration, camaraderie—and that means we can still grow our careers and our networks. Once we’ve drawn our local boundaries we know where to best apply ourselves. However, we also need to understand our individual boundaries, or rather how much we apply ourselves. This is within our circle of control. We start by not volunteering at work. We already have a job that we get paid for, so anything beyond that is extra work and in case I haven’t been clear so far—the org won’t care. Despite our best intentions, such work will be thankless and the law of diminishing returns will slap us in the face so hard we’ll get whiplash. We can do ourselves some serious lasting damage if we don’t exercise a healthy level of self-discipline. If you push yourself to your limits and burn out for a company, you are trading years of your future productivity for minor gains in the present. This isn’t the same as coasting, holding back, or phoning it in. There are plenty of ways to do a lot of good work within our circle of control. Indeed, it’s the only thing we truly control—applying our skills and abilities and getting direct satisfaction from that. There will always be times where we feel an urge to do more than asked, show some initiative, or simply seek appreciation from those beyond our circle of influence. We can indulge these urges, if we want, but we must be mindful. Whenever we’re doing extra work it should be clear to us why we’re doing it. The simplest (and least likely) reason to “volunteer” ourselves is because the org compensates us for it. What? It could happen! Maybe. Telling my boss “yes,” when they asked if I speak Spanish fluently and following it up with, “but not for free,” has been the highlight of my day, so far. Alternatively, we can “compensate” ourselves. We can always do extra work as long as we’re getting something out of it. This runs the gamut from acquiring a new skill to optimizing an annoying workflow bottleneck to securing our team’s delivery of a long-awaited feature. Whatever the reason or result, any extra work is a courtesy we extend to ourselves or our circle of influence. We should always assume that only we (or our teammates) will appreciate it. If that’s not enough to justify the effort then we don’t do it. This threshold of what constitutes extra work (or if we should do it) will be personal. The calculation will vary per person. Some can tolerate a great deal if the pay is good, while others can’t. Others will risk burning themselves out doing small favors for everybody, and others won’t. To each their own, I say. We can’t feel guilty or less of ourselves when we see somebody else’s circle of control is different than our own. We can only define it for ourselves and work happily within those confines. We should be careful about counting any vague, top-down forms of recognition as fair exchange for extra work or validation that we’re doing a good job. If we’re doing great work everyone will know because our circle of influence (manager, reports, peers) will be singing our praises. Word will spread. We don’t need to actively seek out credit or accolades by trying to do more. Either way, the slippery slope here is that an understanding of your contributions loses valuable detail at the org level. By definition, the wider our reputation the less control we have over its interpretaton. The org doesn’t care about us, so when all is said and done even the brightest star at the company will still be a resource. If you always deliver, they’ll always lean on you. And the more efficient you are? The more you get exploited. This perverse form of “recognition” could backfire on us in several ways. We might become the subject matter expert for some arcane legacy system or a new feature that requires constant maintenance. We risk getting typecast as “The Only Person Who Knows How To Do X”. We’ll get saddled with an additional workload or a new role we don’t actually have the bandwidth for. Again, we might actually be OK with such recognition—some could be legitimate career opportunities—but let’s not fool ourselves into thinking it’s true gratitude on the part of the org. However much we ingratiate ourselves with the org nothing is guaranteed. Despite the many YouTubers who naively pontificate on how to become recession-proof or dodge layoffs whenever the org flinches, no single company is going to save us. We have to be ready to save ourselves, and at any moment. This means job seeking on a casual and continual basis. Treat it like a hobby. Yes, even if we have a job already. And yes, even if we love that job. Think of the activities we do almost exclusively when we’re between jobs and do them on a smaller scale more regularly. Keeping our resume up to date, for instance, is far easier if we document our accomplishments as they happen. We can also practice other activities like staying in touch with colleagues, researching companies and their cultures, attending meetups or networking events, and even doing interviews! A low key job search can help in a few ways. For one, should we suddenly find ourselves unemployed we’re better prepared. We’ve already done some of the legwork that’d feel much harder to do in the moment. Any practice we’ve done also comes across as confidence to potential recruiters and interviewers. Second, it’s a chance for introspection and self-awareness. We’ll come to know more clearly what we like or dislike about our current job. It will also help to identify what we’re capable of and what we expect of ourselves or others. Useful for future jobs, yes, but this understanding makes us better at our current job, too. If nothing else, it might just cheer us up from time to time. I’ve had more than one Very Bad Day that found me cruising jobs on LinkedIn during my lunch break. And at one particularly toxic company I had a draft resignation letter open for a couple of months. Whenever the job wore me down I’d edit it a bit more. You know, as a treat! By the time I actually sent that letter it was bulletproof and very satisfying. Ultimately, proactive job seeking like this provides us with confidence, autonomy, and options. I’ve tried very hard to describe organizational behavior on its own terms and not as the deliberate intent of specific people. Just like us, executives have a role to play as part of the org, too. They may benefit from the system more than we do but they’re subjected to it all the same. Your CEO might actually be a nice human being. Most of them are! Elon Musk, on the other hand, is a demon wearing a meat suit. It’s the billionaires—and leaders who emulate them—that we need to worry about. So, I don’t have any useful advice for Musk, Bezos, Zuckerberg, or Altman. For anyone else in a leadership position I can only hope you looking into every nook and cranny of your org, seeing the people working for you, and doing right by them as best you can. I’ll admit I started writing this while in a somewhat bitter mood. However, it was a good exercise in helping me firm up some positive and actionable lessons. I find it reassuring that how I navigate an org doesn’t have to contradict my personal principles or how I work. In fact, they’re the very tools I need. I firmly believe that we can find a way to exist—flourish, even—without the org eroding our personal values. We don’t want to be naive, but that doesn’t mean we just give in to cynicism. I hate my job. The work sucks. The people suck. The pay sucks.looks up and sees motivational poster on wallWell this changes everything The steps seem simple enough. Make peace with the fact that any org is an irrational entity that always exists on the periphery. Focus our attention and effort on our circle of influence. Maintain rigorous and healthy personal boundaries. Always be ready to move on. It sucks that we have to do so even if we like where we work or feel like we’re doing well. It’s human nature to worry less about our well-being when the risks or costs are not evident or immediate. However, things are lovely until suddenly they’re not. Protect yourself. My promise to you is that there will be far more good days than bad days. Ultimately, the fact that your job doesn’t care about you is liberating! It’s not personal. You do you. My promise to myself is that I’m going to spend less time accommodating the company and more time empowering myself. Less time worried about what the CEO thinks and more time worried about how my coworkers feel. Less energy trying to save the world and more time simply being proud of myself and my work. We all want to do awesome things and make an impact at work. However, what we call “work” is a relationship between employer and employee that's inherently and persistently designed to benefit the former over the latter. How do we meaningfully contribute, earn a living, and maybe even enjoy ourselves when the organization simply does not care about us? Matt Hogg FYI Web developer. Technical leader. Husband. Father.

Archives Increased sea-level contribution from northwestern Greenland for models that reproduce observations, Badgeley et al., Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences The Greenland Ice Sheet has been thinning over the past several decades and is expected to contribute significantly to sea-level rise over the coming century. Ice flow models that make these projections, however, tend to underestimate the amount of mass lost from the ice sheet compared to observations, which complicates adaptation and mitigation planning in coastal regions. Here, we constrain a model of northwestern Greenland with a time series of satellite-derived surface velocity data and time-dependent physics to infer unknown ice properties. The model reproduces observed mass loss over the past 13 y within uncertainty. This model—constrained by more data—leads to about 8 to 17% greater sea-level rise contribution from this region by 2100. Evidence of Emerging Increasing Trends in Observed Subdaily Heavy Precipitation Frequency in the United States, Mascaro et al., Geophysical Research Letters The magnitude and frequency of heavy precipitation are expected to increase under warming temperatures caused by climate change. These trends have emerged in observational records but with much larger evidence on a daily rather than a subdaily scale. Here, we quantify long-term changes in heavy precipitation frequency in the United States using hourly observations in 1949–2020 from 332 gauges. We demonstrate that, when analyzed collectively, the frequencies of heavy precipitation at multiple durations from hourly to daily exhibit an increase that cannot be explained by natural climate variability. Upward trends are significant at ∼20%–40% of the gauges throughout the country except for the coastal western and southeastern regions, with higher percentages for longer durations. We also show that the frequency of hourly heavy precipitation has mainly grown after ∼2000, thus explaining the limited evidence of trends at the subdaily scale reported in past studies. Giuseppe Mascaro thanks funding from the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) awards #2212702: “CAS-Climate: A Novel Process-Driven Method for Flood Frequency Analysis Based on Mixed Distributions” and #2221803: “Collaborative Research: CAS—Climate: Improving Nonstationary Intensity-Duration-Frequency Analysis of Extreme Precipitation by Advancing Knowledge on the Generating Mechanisms.” Battery electric vehicles show the lowest carbon footprints among passenger cars across 1.5–3.0 °C energy decarbonisation pathways, Šimaitis et al., Communications Earth & Environment Passenger car carbon footprints are highly sensitive to future energy systems, a factor often overlooked in life cycle assessment. We use a time-dependent prospective life cycle assessment to enhance carbon footprints under four 1.5–3.0 °C decarbonisation pathways for electricity, fuel, and hydrogen from an energy-based integrated assessment model. Across 5000 comparative cases, battery electric vehicles consistently have the lowest carbon footprints compared to hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and fuel-cell vehicles. For example, battery electric vehicles show an average 32 to 47% lower footprint than hybrid combustion in 3.0 °C and 1.5 °C climate-compatible futures, respectively. This is driven by greater projected decarbonisation of electricity compared to fossil-dominated fuels and hydrogen. Battery electric vehicles meaningfully retain their advantage for mileages over 100,000 km, even in regions with carbon-intensive electricity since these are anticipated to decarbonise the most. Although our study supports battery electric vehicles as the most reliable climate-mitigation option for passenger cars, reducing their high manufacturing footprint remains important. Can dissent be meaningfully measured in an overwhelming consensus? A citation network case study in climate change research, Grunert, PLOS Clim ate In scientific discourse, the prevalence of overwhelming consensus obscures the presence of dissenting views as well as their characteristics. This paper explores the potential to meaningfully measure dissent within the context of such a consensus, using climate change research as a case study. Using citation analysis to explore the dynamics of scientific publications and the reception of dissenting opinions, this project questions whether there may be a methodological framework for quantifying dissent. This study employs analysis of citation networks to assess the visibility and impact of minority viewpoints, as well as the viability of such a study. The findings indicate that because dissent in climate change research is miniscule such measurements are limited. Despite that finding, researchers on the fringe of scientific consensus have an outsized impact on social viewpoints. This project has potential to disrupt the ways researchers critically consider the relevance of dissenting research in their own fields, and to think of ways to embrace the impact of research that expands their fields. In the face of anti-science politics, silence is not without cost, Editors, Nature We recognize that not all scientific leaders are in a position to be able to speak out, particularly those in countries where doing so could incur a penalty — or even punishment. That is why our call is to international scientific organizations. Academies in countries where the freedom to dissent is protected should also make their concerns known. All need to be aware that silence is also not without cost.

Title: Xbox and Meta officially release limited edition black and green Meta Quest 3S bundle

Though if you want a quality VR headset, perhaps saving for a Quest 3 is a better plan. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. A few days ago we were treated to a sneak peak of the recent collaboration between Xbox and Meta Quest. The Xbox themed virtual reality headset was leaked by a BestBuy employee earlier this week, but now the official news blast is out. This limited edition black and green Meta Quest 3S is now available for purchase on Meta's website, or at Best Buy for folks in the USA, Argos and EE for UK readers. The headset looks almost exactly how we pictured it, harkening back to the original Xbox design. The matt black finish is highlighted with vibrant green trimmings, which I have to admit do look pretty cool. There's something to a VR setup that's giving Matrix aesthetics, just as long as I don't also have to be held in a weird gooey egg thing while machines harvest my life force. The headset would have to be a little bit cooler before I sign up for that. The special Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition bundle is going for $400 USD, but includes a bit of extra kit. Alongside the black and green 128 GB Meta Quest 3S, you also get Meta Touch Plus controllers, a limited-edition Xbox Wireless controller, and a Meta Quest Elite strap all themed to match. Alongside the bundled hardware are also a couple of subscriptions to help let you try out some VR games. You get 3 months of Meta Horizon+ and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate to try. This will let folks try games like Asgard's Wrath 2, which has been a highlight for VR gamers since its release. Judging by the included Xbox Wireless controller, this bundle isn't intended to limit folks to VR games on the headset. Instead it looks designed to be used as sort of theatre room replacement, where you can play all your Xbox games from the comfort of your headset. It's also worth noting if you already have GamePass these extra 3 months should stack and give you a bit of extra time on your subscription. The thing about this bundle I struggle with, however, is you'll never see it when using it. Half the joy of a limited edition fancy looking console or controller is looking down at it and smiling smugly to yourself during use. Thinking how it's cool that you have this nifty version of a thing you love that's just a little bit different to what's out there. This is really hard to do while wearing a VR headset. If you are keen on this collaboration, you might want to get in fast; stock is said to be super limited for this bundle. Personally, I'd forgo this and work on getting a full Quest 3 instead. Those heightened specs are well worth the price difference—which is why that's our pick as best VR headset right now—and that's certainly more beneficial than a black and green colourway.

Δ The rise took the company’s market cap to about $3.75 trillion, making it the world’s most valuable company, ahead of Microsoft, CNBC reportedWednesday. The increase in Nvidia shares was driven by the company’s latest earnings results, which showed robust growth and potential for future strength, according to the Bloomberg report. While Nvidia faces restrictions on selling advanced semiconductors in China, the company also has big customers like Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet and Amazon that are aggressively building artificial intelligence infrastructure, the report said. The company’s stock price has risen 14% this year after rising 170% last year and leaping 240% in 2023, per the report. Wall Street remains optimistic about the stock because it is showing both high growth and a reasonable multiple, the report said. In a presentation released in conjunction with a shareholder meeting held Wednesday, Nvidia reported that its fiscal year 2025 revenue was up 114% year over year. At the meeting, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that in addition to AI, the company sees opportunities for growth in robotics, beginning with self-driving cars, according to the CNBC report. “We have many growth opportunities across our company, with AI and robotics the two largest, representing a multitrillion-dollar growth opportunity,” Huang said, per the report. Huang added that the business unit that includes automotive and robotics was up 72% on an annual basis and accounted for 1% of the company’s total revenue in the latest quarter, the report said. Together with its AI chips, Nvidia has increasingly been offering related products like software, a cloud service and networking chips, according to the report. Huang said in the shareholder meeting that Nvidia no longer thinks of itself as a “chip company” but rather as a provider of “AI infrastructure” or “computing platform,” per the report. During a May 28 earnings call, Huang said Nvidia is pushing ahead with AI infrastructure projects worldwide to meet soaring demand for AI workloads. “The age of AI is here, from AI infrastructures, inference at scale, sovereign AI, enterprise AI and industrial AI,” Huang said. “Nvidia is ready.” Nvidia Shares Hit All-Time High as Companies Add AI Infrastructure Commerce Giants Expand Into Stores With New Debit and Credit Cards Fed Votes to Advance Proposal to Ease Banks’ Capital Requirements Apple Reportedly Set to Propose Easier Access to Offers Outside App Store We’re always on the lookout for opportunities to partner with innovators and disruptors.

Title: Nvidia Rises to Record as AI Spending Momentum Stays Strong

(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. shares rose to an all-time high on Wednesday, with the leader in artificial intelligence chips extending an advance that has cemented its position as one of the most valuable companies in the world. The stock rose 3.8% to $153.46, taking out an all-time intraday high that has stood since January. The record is only the latest milestone for the company, which has risen 63% off an April low, a rally that has added more than $1.4 trillion to its market capitalization. Recent earnings results from Nvidia were the latest catalyst for bulls, as the report showed robust growth and pointed to more strength ahead despite the impact of restrictions on the sales of advanced semiconductors in China. Prints from Microsoft Corp., Meta Platforms Inc., Alphabet Inc., and Amazon.com Inc. — which together make up more than 40% of Nvidia’s revenue, per supply chain data compiled by Bloomberg — further underlined how the company’s biggest customers continue to spend aggressively building out their AI infrastructure. “My confidence in Nvidia’s growth is higher than it was a couple months ago, and it seems the AI arms race will continue through 2025 and probably 2026,” said Michael Smith, co-portfolio manager at Allspring Global Investments. “The momentum has clearly been re-established, and Nvidia’s moat has only widened and deepened, meaning its position has only strengthened.” At Nvidia’s shareholder meeting Wednesday, Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang reassured investors that demand remains strong. He reiterated his view that the computer industry is only at the beginning of a massive AI infrastructure upgrade. Little known just a few years ago, Nvidia has emerged as a household name and perhaps the most important stock on Wall Street by becoming the poster child for all things AI. The shares’ gain of more than 14% this year follow a rally of more than 170% in 2024, which itself came in the wake of 2023’s surge of nearly 240%. Even with this strength, it continues to screen as attractive next to its history by some valuation metrics. Nvidia trades at 31 times expected 12-month earnings, below its 10-year average and not far from the Nasdaq 100 Index’s multiple of 27 — despite Wall Street estimates calling for faster growth at Nvidia than the broader tech market. The stock’s PEG ratio — a measure of valuation relative to growth — is at about 0.9, by far the lowest among the Magnificent Seven. The combination of high growth and a reasonable multiple is a key reason why Wall Street remains optimistic about its prospects. Nearly 90% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock, while it trades 13% below the average analyst price target, suggesting many expect the momentum to continue. Despite all that, Nvidia remains under-owned by market professionals relative to other Big Tech peers, an additional sign there is potential for more buying in the weeks to come. Nvidia is owned by 74% of long-only funds, according to data from Bank of America. This puts it behind Amazon, Apple and Microsoft, which is the most owned at 91%. “I’m bullish on this year and next, but like everyone else we don’t know what will happen after that,” said Smith. “The stock doesn’t look expensive, but there can be a limit to how much upside there is in one of the biggest companies in the world. Ultimately the duration of Nvidia’s growth will depend on how long its customers increase their investments in AI. If they slow their spending, it won’t take much to see a big shift in volatility.” (Updates with shareholder meeting in fifth paragraph.)

Title: Nvidia shares hit record high as Wall Street shakes off anxiety about AI chip export controls
URL: https://nypost.com/2025/06/25/business/nvidia-shares-hit-record-high-as-wall-street-shakes-off-anxiety-about-ai-chip-export-controls/

Nvidia shares closed at an all-time high on Wednesday as Wall Street investors shook off fears that US limits on chip exports to China would hurt the company’s business. Led by CEO Jensen Huang, the AI chip giant’s stock rose 4.3% to nearly $154.31 per share in Wednesday trading. Nvidia’s previous all-time closing high was $149.43, which was achieved last Jan. 6 following President Trump’s election win. The stock is up about 15% since the start of the year. The surge pushed its market cap to $3.76 trillion, establishing Nasdaq-listed Nvidia as the world’s most valuable company. Microsoft, a key Nvidia customer, ranked second at $3.65 trillion, followed by Apple at approximately $3 trillion. The rally has occurred despite lingering investor anxiety about President Trump’s move earlier this year to slap fresh export controls on Nvidia’s shipments to China. The restrictions halted shipments of Nvidia’s H20 chips – which had been the only AI processors it could legally export to the country. In May, Nvidia told investors it would lose $8 billion in expected sales from China. Huang himself has grumbled that the “$50 billion China market is effectively closed to US industry.” However, overall demand for Nvidia’s chips remains strong. On Wednesday, Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah raised his price target on Nvidia stock to $250 – which, if achieved, would push its market cap to an unprecedented $6 trillion over time. “While it may seem fantastic that NVDA fundamentals can continue to amplify from current levels, we remind folks that NVDA remains essentially a monopoly for critical tech, and that it has pricing (and margin) power,” Baruah said in a note to clients. For the full year, Wall Street expects Nvidia’s revenue to surge 53% to nearly $200 billion, according to LSEG data. Nvidia shares popped despite mixed results for Wall Street’s main indexes. The Nasdaq was up about 60 points, or 0.3%, while the broad-based S&P 500 was flat and the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 106 points, or 0.3%. The firm dominates the market for advanced computer chips needed to power energy-guzzling artificial intelligence models. Aside from Microsoft, Nvidia’s customers include the likes of Sam Altman’s OpenAI, Elon Musk’s xAI and Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta. The Santa Clara, California-based firm also held its shareholder meeting on Wednesday.

Hot on the heels of Meta’s Xbox-edition Quest 3S headset debut, Best Buy is offering a FREE $50 gift card with the 512GB Quest 3 unit at $499.99 shipped.

However, today’s deal on Best Buy effectively gives you a $50 discount by including a FREE $50 gift card that you can use toward other purchases. Today’s offer essentially lets you have this headset for $450, which happens to be the lowest we first tracked for it earlier this year with a similar FREE gift card offer at Amazon.

Other standout features include Direct Touch technology, which lets you navigate using hand gestures instead of controllers, and a bundled 18W power adapter.

Key allegations in a recently filed securities fraud class action complaint against the company and certain of its officers have survived a motion to dismiss. That complaint alleges that Napco Security Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: NSSC), through certain of its officers and directors, made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Napco failed to address any material weaknesses with internal controls regarding cost of goods sold ("COGS") and inventory; (2) Napco downplayed the severity of material weaknesses regarding their internal controls; (3) Napco’s unaudited financial statements from September 30, 2022 to the present included “certain errors” such as overstating inventory and understanding net COGS, resulting in overstated gross profit, operating income and net income for each period; (4) as a result, Napco would need to restate its previously filed unaudited financial statements for certain periods; and (5) as a result, Defendants’ statements about its business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. On April 11, 2025, the federal court determined that key allegations would survive Defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint. In so holding, the court determined “Plaintiffs have adequately stated Exchange Act claims by pleading scienter [knowledge of wrongdoing] through defendants’ unusual stock sales and by plausibly alleging loss causation between the corrective announcement and stock price drop. Plaintiffs have also stated Securities Act claims against Napco and the underwriter defendants.” . . . “Taking the well-pleaded facts as true, there is no question that plaintiffs have adequately pled scienter. First, the stock sales were highly unusual in timing and amount. As to amount, the total proceeds of over $108 million from stock sales by the officer defendants weigh in favor of a motive. . . . And the officer defendants sold hefty percentages of their holdings – 48.5% for Soloway and 45.5% for Buchel.” What To Do Now: If you have held Napco shares since before November 7, 2022 and would like to learn more about this matter, please visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/Napco-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua H.

Title: Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan on how he shrugged off Trump’s accusations

Diane Brady is executive editorial director of the Fortune CEO Initiative and Fortune Live Media. She also writes the CEO Daily newsletter. Good morning. Every time I’ve seen Brian Moynihan over the years, whether it was at a press briefing after being called America’s worst big bank CEO early in his tenure or watching him get trashed by Donald Trump on stage at Davos, one word has come to mind: unflappable. Now in his 16th year as CEO of Bank of America, Moynihan plays the long game. In this week’s Leadership Next podcast, the man now considered to be one of America’s best big bank CEOs says he would have told his younger self to move faster at making change and to “stay strong, keep calm and carry on.” “I testified in Congress before I was CEO,” he says, “and was told by the head of a House investigation committee ‘there’s no way you should be CEO of this company.’ He didn’t think our company was any good or I was any good.” Flash forward a few years and that person was “a good colleague” on other issues. “I don’t hold grudges” quips Moynihan, “except as an Irish person for 100 years.” Growing up with seven siblings in Marietta, Ohio, Moynihan wanted to be a criminal lawyer like Perry Mason. Instead, he became a corporate lawyer for FleetBoston Financial, which merged with BofA in 2004. Tapped as CEO in 2010, Moynihan recently said he would like to stay until the stock price more than doubles to $100—which he seems confident about achieving in these volatile times. “You need to be willing to step in and lead in good times and bad times,” he says. “Some people wear that responsibility like a comfortable sweater and some people could never get into it.” As for that moment in Davos when Trump publicly accused him of refusing to do business with conservatives? “What you try to be is an energy giver, not an energy taker. So when you’re in a situation of pressure, how do you give people energy? By being calm and showing them a way to do something as a team and as a group that enables you to make progress.” That’s a quality he hires for, too: “You’re looking for people who can be calm at a point of attack,” he says. “When 210,000 team members look at you, they don’t want to see a person who’s going to panic. You may have nervous energy behind you or wonder in the middle of night, what the heck is going on? But if you show that and you let it eat at you, you can’t give energy.” You can listen to our full conversation on Apple, Spotify or YouTube. More news below.Contact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at diane.brady@fortune.com NATO on edge for Trump visit The president is in The Hague today for a top-level NATO meeting at which the military alliance is expected to confirm big increases in defense spending. On the way to the Netherlands, Trump cast doubt on the U.S.’s commitment to Article 5, the part of the NATO treaty that says if one member is attacked, all members must respond. “Depends on your definition. There are numerous definitions of Article 5. You know that, right? But I’m committed to being their friends,” he told reporters on Air Force One. Trump shares DM from NATO chief The president also posted on social media an obsequious personal message from NATO chief Mark Rutte welcoming him to the meeting. It calls Trump “truly extraordinary” and says “You will achieve something NO American president in decades could get done.” Read it here. Leaked Pentagon report downplays Iran bombing The U.S. air strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities did less damage than the president claimed and probably only set back their development by months, according to a leaked report from the Defense Intelligence Agency. The report suggests that although the entrances to the underground bunkers were caved in the facilities inside remain intact. Trump used social media to insist that the sites were “obliterated.” Meanwhile, the ceasefire between Iran and Israel, briefly broken yesterday, seems to be holding. Judge rules against Jony Ive and Sam Altman A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order against Ive and Altman’s io AI device venture, according to the FT. OpenAI was forced to take down a blog post announcing their deal because it may infringe upon a trademark established by iyO, a startup founded by Jason Rugolo, who is also pursuing a wearable AI device. Landmark AI copyright decision A U.S. District Judge has ruled that it was “fair use” for AI company Anthropic to train its models on copyrighted books. That is, as long as Anthropic purchased those books and didn’t pirate them. Powell talks to Congress Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell told Congress on Tuesday that interest rates haven’t been lowered yet because the Fed predicts a “meaningful increase in inflation over the course of this year.” Powell notably declined to comment on President Trump’s policies during the Congressional hearing.

(“DoubleVerify” or the “Company”) (NYSE: DV) common stock between November 10, 2023 and February 27, 2025, inclusive (the “Class Period”). IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR DOUBLEVERIFY INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On May 7, 2024, DoubleVerify released its first quarter 2024 financial results and reduced its 2024 revenue guidance, disclosing that there had been a pullback in customer spending on advertising. On this news, DoubleVerify’s stock price fell $11.79, or 38.6%, to close at $18.78 per share on May 8, 2024, thereby injuring investors. Then, on February 27, 2025, DoubleVerify reported lower-than-expected fourth quarter 2024 sales and earnings due in part to reduced customer spending. The Company also disclosed that the shift of ad dollars from open exchanges to closed platforms was having a negative impact on the Company. On this news, DoubleVerify’s stock price fell $7.83, or 36%, to close at $13.90 per share on February 28, 2025. Then, on March 28, 2025, Adalytics Research, LLC published a report alleging, among other things, that DoubleVerify’s web advertisement verification and fraud protection services were ineffective and that its customers were regularly billed for ad impressions served to bots. The same day, The Wall Street Journal reported that DoubleVerify regularly missed detection of nonhuman traffic despite the Company’s claims that it helps brands avoid serving ads to nonhuman bot accounts. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (2) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on its Activation Services was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (3) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (4) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (5) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; (6) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities; and (7) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times.

Title: These 3 Big Dividends Just Got Cut. They’re Safer Than Ever

Time Published: 2025-06-24T16:17:00Z
Full Content:
ByMichael Foster ByMichael Foster, Contributor. Hundred Dollar Bill Being Cut With a Scissor If you invest for long enough, you may hear a skeptic of high-yield investments—such as 8%+ yielding closed-end funds—say something like: “Sure, you’re getting a lot of income now, but what if that dividend gets cut?” Today we’re going to answer that with a look at how a dividend cut can actually send a CEF (or any dividend investment, really) on a profitable run. We’ll do it by looking at three CEFs that followed this exact pattern: Cutting dividends and then going on to give investors huge returns for years and years. These funds show that a dividend cut on its own isn’t reason enough to avoid an investment. It could, in fact, be a buy signal. Let’s start with the Liberty All-Star Growth Fund (ASG), which yields 8.2% as I write this and trades at a 7.7% discount to net asset value (NAV, or the value of its underlying portfolio). Put another way, the fund’s portfolio is valued at just over 92 cents on the dollar. That portfolio consists of a basket of large- and mid-cap stocks, with holdings like Nvidia (NVDA) and Meta Platforms (META) alongside firms such as property manager FirstService (FSV) and Ollie’s Bargain Outlet Holdings (OLLI), which runs a chain of discount stores. The fund uses an approach to dividends that a handful of other CEFs also follow: It commits to paying 8% of its NAV in payouts each year (in ASG’s case through four quarterly installments). That means that the dividend does tend to float, and the latest one is about 17% below where it was a decade or so ago. Now in light of that policy, this dividend “cut” is a little different than one we might see at a fund with a fixed payout, like the two we’ll examine next. But regardless, ASG’s lower payout might cause some investors to pass on the fund. That’s too bad for them, since ASG has delivered plenty of special dividends in the last decade (the spikes in the chart above), culminating in a 162% total return (with price gains and reinvested dividends). Did ASG’s payout technically decline? Yes. But that strong total return more than makes up for it, proving that the lower payout is a poor reason to avoid this well-run CEF. Our next fund yields well into the double digits: the 13.6%-yielding BlackRock Technology and Private Equity Term Trust (BTX). As the name says, BTX holds well-known tech stocks like NVIDIA, Amazon.com (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL). It also holds a collection of private-equity investments. We added BTX to my CEF Insider service in our April 2025 issue. But before then we avoided it, partly because its IPO was in 2021, when many tech firms, and many of the PE investments BTX’s former management team purchased, were overvalued. BTX, which replaced its managers at the end of January, has only recently traded at what I would consider a buyable price. We’ve been more than happy that we were patient! In less than two months since our buy call, BTX has returned 16%, as of this writing. Even with its recent dividend cut (more on that in a moment), BTX’s current yield still translates to more than $11,000 per month on every $1 million invested. But you could easily miss this if you just looked at its dividend history. BTX Dividend Of course, a 19.3% decline in the last five years jumps out, and that gentle slide lower at the right side of the chart also looks like it could be a warning sign. Let’s take the second point first: That slide is due to the fact that the fund’s previous management team overdid it on their last dividend hike. The new team is gradually adjusting lower. That’s not a reason to worry. Meantime, a major reason why BTX’s yield so high is that the fund remains underpriced, even after its recent run (as yields and share prices move in opposite directions). As you can see above, at the start of the year, it traded at a double-digit discount that has since narrowed to around 2%. That’s a major reason for the 16% total return we’ve realized from this fund at CEF Insider. So, even if BTX’s 13.6% yield is at risk of moving lower, investors who’ve bought the fund are still doing fine, thanks to the stock-price appreciation they’ve realized. (And of course, the huge income stream, which remains so even with a decline.) In other words, a continued gradual drift lower in the payout is fine, as long as BTX’s portfolio keeps rising. We’ve seen that happen consistently over the last couple of months, and I expect it to continue as the fund’s discount moves closer to becoming a premium. Finally, let’s consider another “cutter” that’s (now) delivering consistent income: the Pioneer High Income Fund (PHT), which holds high-yield corporate bonds. PHT’s portfolio has been appreciating, despite volatile markets, as the Fed postponed rate cuts. The longer the central bank holds off, the more high-yield, longer-duration bonds PHT can buy (these bonds become more valuable as interest rates decline). PHT has had a 15.6% annualized return over the last three years, as of this writing, as it recovered from the 2022 selloff. And look at what the dividend did in that time: PHT Dividend That 12% payout cut happened while PHT was delivering those same strong returns. Sure, the dividend—current yield 8.2%—made up a smaller part of PHT’s 15.6% annualized return due to the cuts, but capital gains more than made up the difference. In a situation like that, does the lower dividend really matter? Look at it this way: Every dollar put into PHT three years ago now earns a 9.6% yield on an investor’s original cost. And on the price front, every dollar is now worth $1.17. These funds are just three examples of how dividend cuts are only one part of the story when looking at high-yield investments like CEFs—and how they can actually spark a turnaround in an investment’s performance. That said, it’s also true that you can’t just put all of your money in one CEF and rely on that payout for the rest of your life. But it is possible to tap a strong income stream and, with just a bit of elbow grease, rebalance your portfolio every now and then to secure that income stream. And, of course, capital gains are also on the table to grow your portfolio in the long run. Michael Foster is the Lead Research Analyst for Contrarian Outlook.

GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links. It looks like the Xbox team is facing yet another round of cuts. By Eddie Makuch on June 24, 2025 at 8:14AM PDT Microsoft's Xbox division is facing more layoffs soon. That's according to a report from Bloomberg, which said "major" layoffs at Xbox could be announced next week. This would be just the latest round of cuts at Xbox, following 1,900+ layoffs after the Activision Blizzard deal closed and hundreds more job reductions after that. These cuts, and the ones reportedly planned to be announced next week, are believed to be part of a wider cost-cutting program at Microsoft that has resulted in many thousands of layoffs over the past two years. Tom Warren of The Verge reported earlier this month that Xbox would face more layoffs at the end of June. The timing is seemingly not random, as Microsoft's current fiscal year ends on June 30. Today, The Verge reported, citing a source, that "Microsoft is restructuring Xbox distribution across central Europe, resulting in some Xbox operations ceasing in some regions." A spokesperson for Microsoft declined to comment when approach by Bloomberg. GameSpot has contacted Microsoft as well in an attempt to get more details. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer previously said the company needed to cut Xbox staff to be a sustainable business. Xbox president Sarah Bond gave an answer many were not pleased with as well regarding the job cuts. Some of Microsoft's new moves in gaming recently have included expanding to branded handheld devices and a new Xbox Meta Quest VR headset. 2026 marks the 25th anniversary of Xbox, and Microsoft has big plans. Microsoft's reported latest round of layoffs comes amid profitable times for the company. For Microsoft's latest quarter, the company reported net revenue of $70.1 billion (up 13%) and a net profit of $25.8 billion (up 18%). The Xbox division specifically has posted year-over-year revenue growth. Microsoft's stock price is up by nearly 150% in the past five years. Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

Debris flows represent a persistent challenge for disaster prediction in mountainous regions due to their highly nonlinear and multivariate triggering mechanisms. This study proposes an explainable deep learning framework, the Improved Kepler Optimization Algorithm-Convolutional Neural Network-Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit-Attention (IKOA-CNN-BiGRU-Attention) model, for precise debris flow hazard prediction in the Yunnan section of the Nujiang River Basin, China. The model is developed and validated using data from 159 debris flow-prone gullies, integrating deep convolutional, recurrent, and attention-based architectures, with hyperparameters autonomously optimized by IKOA. Model explainability is enhanced using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), which quantify the influence of key factors. The IKOA-CNN-BiGRU-Attention framework consistently outperforms 13 benchmark models, achieving a root mean square error of 2.33 × 10−6, mean absolute error of 1.51 × 10−6, and mean absolute percentage error of 0.006%. The model maintains high stability across 50 repeated experiments, strong resilience to 20% input noise, and robust generalizability under five-fold cross-validation. Interpretability analysis identifies potential source energy and maximum 24-hour rainfall as primary determinants and uncovers a dual-threshold physical mechanism underlying debris flow initiation. These findings provide a quantitative basis for adaptive early warning and targeted risk mitigation, and establish a transferable framework for explainable geohazard prediction.

Competing interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. Debris flows constitute a catastrophic geophysical phenomenon that epitomizes the complex interplay between gravitational forces, material rheology, and hydrological dynamics in mountainous environments. These rapid mass movements pose an escalating threat to human settlements, critical infrastructure, and ecological integrity globally, with disproportionate impacts on developing regions with expanding mountain populations [1]. The socioeconomic burden is substantial: between 2000 and 2020, debris flows accounted for approximately 17% of global landslide-related fatalities while generating annual economic losses exceeding 20 billion USD. Unlike other natural hazards with extended warning periods, debris flows manifest with minimal antecedent indicators and propagate at velocities reaching 10 m/s, severely constraining evacuation timeframes and necessitating high-precision predictive frameworks for effective risk reduction [2]. The multifactorial triggering mechanisms underlying these events, characterized by nonlinear threshold responses and complex factor interactions, present formidable challenges for contemporary hazard forecasting. The epistemological evolution of debris flow prediction has traversed distinct methodological paradigms, each characterized by specific conceptual frameworks and analytical limitations. Initial approaches relied on empirical correlations derived from historical event databases, establishing phenomenological relationships for inundation area delineation [3] and precipitation threshold determination [4]. Such frameworks, while operationally accessible, frequently exhibited limited transferability beyond their calibration domains. Subsequent advances introduced physically-based numerical models that simulated the complete process chain from material mobilization through deposition, incorporating rheological principles and granular flow mechanics [5]. These sophisticated simulations demonstrably enhanced impact assessment capabilities [6] and runout predictions in topographically complex terrain. Nevertheless, their widespread implementation remains constrained by intensive parameterization requirements, computational demands, and fundamental uncertainties in constitutive relationships governing material behavior during extreme mobilization events. Intermediate methodological frameworks emerged to address these epistemological limitations through probabilistic formulations and multi-criteria decision architectures. Statistical models employing Bayesian inference frameworks quantified conditional hazard probabilities under varying environmental scenarios, enabling the establishment of robust rainfall thresholds with explicit uncertainty quantification [7]. Concurrently, multi-attribute decision frameworks provided structured methodologies for integrating heterogeneous hazard factors [8], with recent innovations applying Analytic Hierarchy Process techniques to susceptibility mapping across diverse geological contexts [9] and multi-criteria analysis approaches to flood risk assessment in coastal regions [10]. Despite their theoretical elegance, these approaches frequently encounter fundamental constraints in high-dimensional feature space integration and often introduce systematic biases through subjective parameter weighting schemes that compromise prediction reliability. The integration of machine learning (ML) into geohazard assessment represents a paradigmatic transformation in debris flow prediction, facilitating the identification of complex, nonlinear patterns within high-dimensional environmental datasets that remain inaccessible to conventional analytical approaches [11]. Contemporary research has demonstrated the efficacy of artificial neural networks in characterizing rainfall-triggered debris flow probability distributions and advanced information-theoretic coupling methods for susceptibility assessment [12]. These computational frameworks excel in capturing intricate multivariate relationships without requiring explicit physical process formulation [13]. Furthermore, ensemble learning techniques enhance predictive stability and generalization capabilities across heterogeneous environmental conditions previously inaccessible to traditional modeling frameworks. Despite their transformative potential, current ML applications to debris flow hazard assessment exhibit critical epistemological and methodological limitations that constrain their scientific impact and operational utility. First, model performance demonstrates an acute sensitivity to hyperparameter configurations, with suboptimal parameterization inducing overfitting phenomena that compromise generalization to novel geomorphological contexts [14]. Second, conventional optimization algorithms frequently converge prematurely to local extrema, resulting in suboptimal exploration of the high-dimensional parameter space [15]. Third, and most fundamentally, deep learning architectures manifest intrinsic opacity that creates a profound disconnect between predictive capacity and mechanistic understanding [16]. This explainability deficit, frequently characterized as the “black-box problem,” represents a critical epistemological barrier in hazard forecasting applications. The black-box problem specifically refers to the inherent inability to trace how deep learning models transform input features into output predictions through their complex internal architectures. This opacity manifests through (1) algorithmic complexity, where numerous interconnected neurons and non-linear activation functions obscure input-output relationships; (2) latent feature representation, where models develop abstract internal representations that lack direct physical interpretation; and (3) stochastic learning behavior, where training procedures yield models whose internal configurations cannot be deterministically predicted. Contemporary neural networks, while achieving unprecedented predictive accuracy, typically obscure the contribution of specific variables to prediction outcomes, thereby inhibiting scientific elucidation of causative mechanisms and undermining the implementation of targeted mitigation strategies. Three fundamental research gaps persist in contemporary literature that motivate this study: (1) the predominant prioritization of predictive accuracy over model explainability creates an artificial tension between computational performance and theoretical advancement; (2) current methodological frameworks overwhelmingly employ single-algorithm approaches that inadequately capture the complex spatiotemporal characteristics of debris flow triggering conditions; and (3) the systematic integration of advanced optimization techniques with explainable artificial intelligence frameworks remains largely unexplored in geohazard prediction contexts, particularly for multi-parameter debris flow risk assessment. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methodologies, particularly the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) approach, offer promising solutions to these challenges by providing mathematically rigorous attribution mechanisms derived from cooperative game theory principles [17,18]. Despite preliminary applications identifying dominant controlling factors in debris flow research, comprehensive XAI integration within holistic debris flow assessment frameworks remains substantially underdeveloped [19]. Motivated by these research gaps and the potential of XAI approaches, this study aims to develop and validate an integrated deep learning framework that maximizes both predictive accuracy and scientific explainability for debris flow hazard assessment. The specific research objectives include: (1) identifying optimal architectural configurations for capturing complex spatiotemporal characteristics of debris flow triggering factors; (2) quantifying the relative contribution of environmental, geological, and meteorological variables; (3) establishing a theoretical framework connecting physical processes to prediction outcomes through explainable AI; and (4) determining quantitative thresholds governing debris flow risk to support evidence-based intervention strategies. To address these objectives, this study implements an IKOA-CNN-BiGRU-Attention framework that integrates physics-inspired optimization algorithms with deep learning architectures and explainability mechanisms. This framework combines convolutional networks for spatial feature extraction, bidirectional recurrent units for temporal dynamics modeling, and attention mechanisms for feature importance weighting, specifically designed to capture debris flow triggering mechanisms while providing SHAP-based scientific insights. The framework advances debris flow hazard prediction methodologically, theoretically, analytically, and practically, offering actionable insights for precision disaster risk management. The overall workflow of the study is illustrated in Fig 1. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.g001 Precise determination of influencing factor weights constitutes a fundamental challenge in debris flow hazard assessment. This study proposes a novel game theory-based comprehensive weighting framework that integrates three complementary methodologies: the coefficient of variation method (CVM), entropy weight method (EWM), and CRITIC method [20–22]. Each methodology captures distinct aspects of factor importance: data dispersion, information entropy, and inter-factor correlations, respectively. The proposed framework applies cooperative game theory principles to optimize the collective strengths of these methods, conceptualizing each as a strategic element in a cooperative game to determine optimal weight distribution. The complete framework is illustrated in Fig 2. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.g002 The Kepler Optimization Algorithm (KOA), introduced by Mohamed Abdel-Basset in 2023, serves as the foundation for model optimization in this study. KOA represents a physics-based metaheuristic algorithm inspired by Kepler’s three laws of planetary motion [23]. This algorithm conceptualizes the Sun as the optimal solution and planets as candidate solutions, with planetary motion mechanisms driving the evaluation of solution quality. Compared to established optimization algorithms such as Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) and Sparrow Search Algorithm (SSA), KOA exhibits enhanced exploration capabilities within the solution space through innovative search strategies, enabling effective avoidance of local optima entrapment while ensuring stability and robustness in hyperparameter optimization for complex models. From a mathematical perspective, KOA operates through seven sequential steps: Step 1: Initialization process. The algorithm begins with a random generation of candidate solutions representing planets moving within the search space. Each planet possesses a position and velocity representing potential optimization solutions. Each planetary position is formally defined as shown in Equation (1). In Equation (1), Xi represents the ith candidate solution in the model; d represents the number of dimensions; N indicates the number of candidate solutions; Xji,up and Xji,low determine the boundary range of the search space, with rand[0,1] randomly selected values between and . The eccentricity ei and period Ti are initialized according to Equations (2) and (3). In Equations (2) – (3), r is a random number based on a normal distribution. Step 2: Defining the gravitational force (F). Planets experience varying velocities at different orbital positions due to differential gravitational pull from the Sun along elliptical planetary orbits. The gravitational force experienced by a planet is formulated as in Equation (4), while the Euclidean distance is represented in Equation (5). Step 3: Calculating object velocity. Based on gravitational force and Sun-planet distance, the velocity of a planet at any position on its elliptical orbit is expressed as Equation (6). Step 4: Escaping from local optima. The parameter π in the velocity equation modulates search direction, simulating varying orbital directions of planets within the Solar System. This mechanism prevents convergence on local optima, as shown in Equation (7). Step 5: Updating object positions. Planetary motion occurs in two distinct phases: approaching and receding from the Sun. These correspond to the exploitation and exploration phases respectively. During exploration, the algorithm discovers new candidate solutions. During exploitation, solutions near the optimum are refined, as shown in Equation (8). Step 6: Updating Sun-planet distance. Manipulation of parameter h enhances exploration and exploitation capabilities, as shown in Equation (9). Step 7: Elitism mechanism. The algorithm evaluates fitness values between current and newly calculated positions, retaining superior solutions while discarding inferior ones, as shown in Equation (10). Despite the promising capabilities of physics-inspired metaheuristics, optimization algorithms frequently encounter fundamental challenges including premature convergence, local optima entrapment, and suboptimal exploration-exploitation balance. To overcome these intrinsic limitations in the standard KOA framework, this study proposes a systematically enhanced variant, the Improved Kepler Optimization Algorithm (IKOA), incorporating three complementary methodological refinements: (1) Chebyshev mapping for ergodic population initialization, (2) golden sine operator for solution space adaptation, and (3) dynamic weight coefficient for balanced search dynamics. This integrative approach ensures exceptional parameter optimization robustness across complex hypersurfaces. The complete algorithmic architecture is illustrated in Fig 3. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.g003 Chaos mapping represents an uncertain and random methodology within nonlinear dynamic systems. In the process of initializing position updates, chaotic variables replace the random variables traditionally used in intelligent algorithm processes, thereby offering a broader search range in the solution space compared to probability-based random search strategies. Consequently, employing chaos mapping for population initialization in the KOA enhances the diversity of the population and the convergence speed of the optimization algorithm. This study utilizes the Chebyshev chaos mapping method [24], with its mathematical description presented in Equation (11), where k denotes the order. The Golden Sine Algorithm (Gold-SA), proposed by Tanyildizi et al., is a novel metaheuristic algorithm [25]. Gold-SA differs from swarm intelligence algorithms by focusing on enhancing search efficiency and optimization precision in the later stages through the gradual narrowing of the current solution space. This means that the current search space continuously converges towards the optimal target value. In the traditional KOA algorithm, the efficiency of local and global searches by planetary individuals is relatively low, making the algorithm more susceptible to becoming trapped in local optima as it progresses. By incorporating the golden sine operator into Step 5, and leveraging the properties of the golden ratio coefficient to reduce the solution space, the overall performance of the algorithm is significantly improved. The position update formula with the added golden sine operator is presented in Equation (12). In Equation (15), R1∈[0, 2π]is a random number determining the distance of the individual’s movement in the next iteration, R2∈[0, π] is a random number determining the direction of the next movement, and x1 = -π+(1-π)*2π, x2 = -π + τ*2πare coefficients derived from the golden section ratio τ=(-1)/2, This ratio narrows the algorithm’s search space and guides individuals gradually towards the optimum. To address the issue of insufficient global exploration capability during the position updates for planets close to the Sun in Step 6, a dynamic weight coefficient based on the number of iterations is introduced in Equation (9). This addition provides a balanced capability for global exploration and local exploitation of the algorithm, as detailed in the improved formula shown in Equation (13). In Equation (13), k1 = 1-t3/T3, k2 = t3/T3. Within Equation (13), k1 is larger in the early stages of iteration, enhancing the planets’ early exploration ability, while k2 gradually increases in the later stages, ensuring the planets’ local exploitation capability in the latter phase. To evaluate IKOA’s optimization capabilities, this study implemented a benchmark analysis using nine standard test functions from the CEC 2005 benchmark suite [26]. These functions provide standardized performance metrics across multiple dimensions: unimodal functions f1-f5 assess local exploitation efficiency; multimodal functions f6-f7 examine global exploration capabilities; and fixed-dimension multimodal functions f8-f9 evaluate performance in complex search spaces. Table 1 presents the mathematical formulations and characteristics of each function. Experimental dimensionality was set at 30 for functions f1-f7 and 2 for functions f8-f9, following standard protocols. The comparative analysis included IKOA, original KOA, and three contemporary algorithms: Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), Sparrow Search Algorithm (SSA), and Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) [27–29]. Each function underwent 30 independent optimization trials, with convergence trajectories illustrated in Fig 4. The analysis demonstrates IKOA’s superior performance across optimization metrics. IKOA consistently exhibits accelerated convergence compared to reference algorithms, achieving superior early-stage exploration and late-stage exploitation precision while maintaining an exceptional balance between search diversification and intensification. These qualities establish IKOA’s theoretical foundation for application in debris flow hazard assessment modeling, where its enhanced optimization capabilities directly translate to improved predictive performance. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.t001 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.g004 This study presents a novel hierarchical deep learning architecture for debris flow hazard assessment that integrates optimization algorithms with specialized neural network components. The IKOA-CNN-BiGRU-Attention framework, illustrated in Fig 5, implements a cascaded processing pipeline for multidimensional geophysical data. The CNN module [30] employs convolutional operations to extract spatially invariant features across multiple abstraction levels, identifying complex topographical signatures that serve as precursors to debris flow events. The BiGRU component [31] extends representation capacity through bidirectional recurrent processing, capturing non-linear dependencies in sequential geophysical processes by propagating information in forward and reverse temporal directions. The Attention mechanism [32] implements adaptive computational focus through learned importance weighting, dynamically modulating feature contributions based on contextual relevance. A distinctive contribution is the meta-optimization approach implemented through IKOA, which systematically refines four foundational hyperparameters: Learning Rate, GRU Units m, CNN Filters n, and Batch Size b. These parameters critically influence model performance, balancing expressiveness, computational efficiency, and generalization capability. The implementation proceeds through four systematic phases: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.g005 Step 1: Data Preprocessing. Statistical standardization establishes numerical stability while K-Nearest Neighbors imputation preserves data integrity through the reconstruction of missing values. Step 2: Model Initialization. The preprocessed dataset undergoes chronological partitioning with 70% allocated for parameter estimation and feature learning. Step 3: Hyperparameter Optimization. IKOA explores the hyperparameter space to identify optimal architectural configurations through iterative performance evaluation. Step 4: Model Deployment. The optimized architecture is applied to the remaining 30% for validation and hazard prediction generation. The study area encompasses the Yunnan section of the Nujiang River Basin in China (Fig 6), spanning approximately 33,500 km2 and constituting 8.7% of Yunnan Province’s total area. This geographically significant region extends 650 km along the Nujiang (Salween) River, bordered by the Lancang River Basin to the east and Myanmar to the west, spanning from the southern margins of the Tibetan Plateau to the northern extent of the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau. The study area is situated between 24°07’ to 28°23’ N latitude and 98°07’ to 100°00’ E longitude. The geomorphology exhibits extreme topographic heterogeneity characterized by dramatic alpine gorges and precipitous mountainous terrain. The landscape features a pronounced north-south elevation gradient, intersected by the Hengduan Mountain Range. The area contains one of the most significant geomorphological features in the region, the Nujiang Grand Canyon, which ranks among the world’s deepest canyon systems. This exceptional topographic amplitude creates optimal conditions for gravitational mass movements, particularly debris flows with substantial kinetic energy and destructive potential. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.g006 The region’s climate is classified as humid subtropical monsoon, characterized by abundant yet spatially heterogeneous precipitation. Annual rainfall demonstrates significant variability, with maximum precipitation reaching approximately 1500 mm in higher elevation zones and diminishing to below 1000 mm in lower elevation areas. Temporal distribution exhibits marked seasonality, with over 51% of annual precipitation concentrated during the summer monsoon period [27]. This concentrated rainfall pattern constitutes the primary triggering mechanism for debris flow mobilization. The geological framework displays exceptional complexity, dominated by metamorphic complexes and sedimentary formations intersected by numerous fault systems. This intricate structural geology, combined with intense neotectonic activity, has produced extensive zones of fractured and weathered lithological material that serves as source material for debris flows. The synergistic interaction between fractured bedrock, steep topographic gradients, and concentrated seasonal precipitation creates ideal conditions for debris flow initiation and propagation. These distinctive geoenvironmental characteristics contribute to the elevated frequency and magnitude of geohazard events throughout the region. The prevalence of these hazards necessitates systematic investigation for effective disaster risk reduction strategies and sustainable regional development initiatives. This research utilizes comprehensive data from 159 debris flow prone gullies distributed throughout the Nujiang River Basin, applying advanced deep learning methodologies to analyze and predict debris flow hazard intensities across diverse geomorphological contexts. Elevation data are based on SRTM DEM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission, NASA/USGS). Administrative boundaries and rivers are from Natural Earth (public domain). Map generated by the authors. This investigation established a comprehensive parametric foundation for debris flow susceptibility analysis through systematic integration of multidisciplinary data sources, including extensive literature synthesis [28], satellite remote sensing explanation, field-based geomorphological investigations, and archival geological and hydrological documentation. Advanced geospatial technologies facilitated rigorous extraction of topographical variables from 30m-resolution SRTM DEM data, while meteorological parameters underwent spatial interpolation through geostatistical inverse distance weighting algorithms calibrated with observational data from meteorological stations distributed throughout the study domain. The extracted factors for the study area include: maximum 24-hour rainfall (X1), annual average rainfall (X2), annual average temperature (X3), annual average wind speed (X4), annual average vapor pressure (X5), annual average relative humidity (X6), potential source energy (X7), catchment area (X8), average gradient of the main channel (X9), length ratio of the sediment supply section (X10), length of the main channel (X11), sinuosity of the main channel (X12), drainage density of the catchment (X13), valley profile roundness (X14), vegetation cover rate (X15), average slope (X16), maximum relative elevation difference within the catchment (X17), lithological impact (X18), and dynamic storage capacity (X19). A total of 19 factors were selected, sequentially numbered as X1 to X19. In line with the principles of systematicity, completeness, effectiveness, and comparability in the selection of evaluation indicators, and considering the accessibility and operability of the data, the debris flow outbreak system in the study area was divided into three subsystems: the hydrometeorological subsystem, material source subsystem, and geographic subsystem, encompassing the aforementioned 19 factors (X1-X19). The rationale for selecting each factor is detailed in Table 2. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.t002 Statistical independence among predictor variables constitutes a critical prerequisite for robust hazard modeling. The research implemented Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) analysis to systematically diagnose multicollinearity and optimize variable selection. VIF quantifies variance inflation of regression coefficients due to linear dependencies, calculated as 1/(1-R2), where R2 represents the coefficient when regressing a variable against all other predictors. While conventional guidelines suggest a VIF threshold of 10, the current investigation adopted a more conservative threshold of 5 to ensure model stability and parameter precision for complex environmental systems [51]. Multicollinearity diagnosis identified four factors exceeding this threshold: X10 (length ratio of the sediment supply section: 7.83), X14 (valley profile roundness: 5.62), X17 (maximum relative elevation difference: 8.14), and X19 (dynamic storage capacity: 6.95). These variables were systematically excluded to maximize model precision. Fig 7 presents the VIF analysis results for all hazard-causing factors, illustrating that the final variable selection optimizes unique information content while minimizing statistical redundancy. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.g007 The inherent complexity of debris flow systems necessitates sophisticated factor weighting approaches that accommodate the multidimensional interactions among diverse variables. This study implements the game theory-based comprehensive weighting methodology detailed in section 2.1, achieving optimal integration of complementary weighting perspectives. The resulting factor weights derived from this approach are presented in Fig 8. The hazard level assessment procedure follows a systematic framework: https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.g008 Step 1: Normalize the original dataset to eliminate the dimensional impact of different factors. The normalization formulas for maximum-type indicators and minimum-type indicators are shown in Equations (14) and (15), respectively. In Equations (14) – (15), xij represents the jth influencing factor of the ith gully, i = 1,2,…,n and j = 1,2,…,m, n denotes the number of data groups, and m denotes the number of factors. Step 2: For each debris flow gully, sum the weighted data of influencing factors to obtain its hazard assessment value. The calculation formula is shown in Equation (16). In Equation (16), wj represents the weight of each factor through Fig 8, and rij denotes the normalized value of the jth influencing factor for the ith gully. To ensure statistical robustness, experimental parameters were standardized with population size fixed at 30 and iteration count at 100 across all optimization algorithms. The dataset underwent a 70%/30% training-testing partition, with results averaged across 50 independent runs. Notably, 12 test samples with distinctive geomorphological characteristics were deliberately included to evaluate model generalization capabilities across diverse debris flow conditions. Performance evaluation employed three complementary metrics: RMSE, MAE, and MAPE. The proposed IKOA-CNN-BiGRU-Attention model demonstrated exceptional predictive accuracy when benchmarked against 13 established machine learning regression models [52–55], as quantified in Table 3. Performance comparisons among the top five models are visualized in Fig 9. The hybrid model achieved unprecedented prediction precision with RMSE of 2.33 × 10−6, MAE of 1.51 × 10−6, and MAPE of 0.006%, representing multiple orders of magnitude improvement over conventional approaches. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.t003 https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.g009 This superior performance reflects systematic hyperparameter optimization through the improved Krill Herd algorithm. The learning rate underwent progressive refinement from 0.0061 to 0.0014, while GRU units converged to 116, CNN filters stabilized at 54, and batch size optimized at 31. The hyperparameter evolution across iterations, detailed in Table 4, demonstrates the algorithm’s capacity to navigate complex parameter spaces while avoiding local optima. Architecturally, the bidirectional GRU component captures temporal dependencies in multidimensional feature sequences, while the attention mechanism adaptively prioritizes critical factors including slope characteristics, precipitation parameters, and drainage properties. Unlike models such as GWO-ELM and PSO-SVM, which exhibit performance degradation with geomorphologically distinct test cases, the IKOA-CNN-BiGRU-Attention model maintains exceptional prediction stability across diverse geological contexts, validating its effectiveness in modeling the inherently nonlinear and multidimensional nature of debris flow hazard systems. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.t004 Through systematic application of SHAP methodology, this study deconstructs the internal decision processes of the IKOA-CNN-BiGRU-Attention model, revealing that the architecture captures both physical threshold effects and multifactorial regulatory relationships governing debris flow initiation. Fig 10(a) presents a quantitative hierarchical ranking of feature importance wherein potential source energy X7 emerges as the predominant factor with a mean absolute SHAP value of 1.07 × 10−2, approximately 4.6-fold greater than the second-ranked parameter. Annual mean temperature X3, annual mean vapor pressure X5, and average slope X16 constitute the second tier of importance, while annual mean rainfall X2, vegetation coverage X15, and main channel length X11 form a distinct third tier. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.g010 Fig 10(b) elucidates the dependency relationship between potential source energy X7 and its corresponding SHAP values, demonstrating a threshold effect in debris flow triggering mechanisms. The relationship manifests as a sigmoidal nonlinear curve, optimally fitted by the cubic function y = 1.25 × 10-4x3 - 9.37 × 10-4x2 + 1.83 × 10-2x − 2.21 × 10−2 with an R2 value of 0.98. A critical inflection point is identified at X7 ≈ 3.12 × 109 J/m2, effectively partitioning the risk domain into two distinct regions: a low-risk zone where X7 < 3.12 × 109 J/m2 and a high-risk zone where X7 > 3.12 × 109 J/m2. Within the low-risk zone, SHAP values consistently approximate zero or exhibit slightly negative values, indicating insufficient energy accumulation for debris flow mobilization; within the high-risk zone, SHAP values demonstrate an accelerating positive trend as X7 increases, reflecting the nonlinear amplification characteristic of debris flow initiation. The SHAP value distribution in Fig 10(c) further illuminates the distinct influence patterns of various factors on model predictions. The distribution for X7 exhibits pronounced bimodal segregation: low-value samples cluster tightly around the zero SHAP value region, while high-value samples display substantial positive shifts, reaching SHAP values exceeding 0.2, surpassing the influence range of all other features. This polarized distribution provides statistical confirmation of the threshold phenomenon. High values of maximum 24-hour rainfall X1 and annual mean relative humidity X6 similarly exhibit positive SHAP value tendencies, albeit with considerably greater dispersion, indicating that these parameters function as conditional triggers whose efficacy is contingent upon the antecedent state of source energy accumulation. Based on the comprehensive SHAP analysis, a physically explainable mechanistic framework for debris flow formation emerges: potential source energy X7 constitutes the fundamental prerequisite condition with a quantified threshold of 3.12 × 109 J/m2; environmental parameters such as annual mean temperature X3 and annual mean vapor pressure X5 function as regulatory modulators, exerting indirect effects by altering source material stability; hydrological factors, primarily maximum 24-hour rainfall X1, operate as activation triggers that initiate debris flow mobilization only when the prerequisite energy threshold condition has been satisfied. Building upon the identification of potential source energy X7 as the dominant factor, this section systematically explores factor interactions and their impact on debris flow risk prediction, revealing complex relationships with implications for monitoring and early warning systems optimization. Fig 11 illustrates the interaction effects between source energy and key environmental variables. The interaction between X7 and annual mean temperature X3 reveals a significant correlation r = 0.06, p < 0.05, with risk contribution substantially increasing when the temperature exceeds 16°C in high source energy areas. This temperature-energy interaction suggests that thermal conditions may accelerate material destabilization processes in areas with significant loose material accumulation. The practical implication for disaster prevention is that temperature monitoring should be integrated into early warning systems, particularly for regions with high material accumulation. Warning thresholds may require seasonal adjustments with heightened vigilance during warmer periods when temperatures exceed 16°C. Similarly, the interaction between X7 and annual mean vapor pressure X5 demonstrates a stronger correlation r = 0.19, p < 0.01, with high X7 samples manifesting significantly elevated SHAP values when X5 exceeds 15 hPa. This finding indicates that humidity sensors should be incorporated into monitoring networks alongside traditional rainfall gauges, particularly in areas with substantial loose material accumulation, as atmospheric moisture conditions appear to play an important role in destabilizing source materials. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.g011 The interaction between maximum 24-hour rainfall X1 and X7 provides particularly valuable insights for risk management. Despite statistical non-significance in overall correlation r = 0.02, p > 0.05, clear nonlinear patterns emerge: rainfall intensity substantially impacts risk only when source energy exceeds approximately 5 × 109 J/m2, while having minimal effect below this threshold. This conditional relationship fundamentally challenges the conventional rainfall-threshold approach to debris flow warning. For early warning system design, this finding suggests implementing a hierarchical approach where areas are first classified by source energy potential, with advanced rainfall monitoring prioritized specifically in high-energy zones. For low-energy zones, basic rainfall monitoring may be sufficient regardless of precipitation intensity. Rainfall thresholds should be dynamic rather than fixed, adjusting based on source material conditions. Fig 12 refines the threshold identification through a detailed SHAP response analysis. The upper panel presents a higher-order polynomial analysis of the X7 SHAP response curve with R2 = 0.99, identifying a critical inflection point at X7 = 3.00 × 109 J/m2. This value provides a quantitative criterion for classifying terrain vulnerability in hazard mapping exercises and prioritizing areas for source material control measures such as check dams, retaining walls, and slope stabilization projects. The upper right panel identifies a distinct inflection point in the X1 SHAP dependency curve at X1 = 27.01 mm, providing a data-driven basis for rainfall warning standards. This specific threshold offers a quantitative reference for evaluating and potentially adjusting current warning thresholds in operational early warning systems. The lower panel integrates these insights into a comprehensive two-dimensional risk contour map with three distinct risk domains that translate directly to operational warning levels. The blue region represents normal conditions where predicted risk values fall below 0.03, warranting routine monitoring procedures. The yellow zone indicates heightened alert conditions with predicted risk values between 0.03 and 0.20, necessitating increased monitoring frequency and preliminary emergency preparations. The red domain signifies emergency response conditions where the predicted risk exceeds 0.20, requiring immediate protective actions including potential evacuations. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.g012 Fig 13 extends this analysis into three dimensions, revealing a comprehensive risk response surface that captures the compound effects of X7 and X1. The visualization of threshold planes creates four distinct quadrants that translate to operational intervention priority zones. The first quadrant, characterized by values below both X7 and X1 thresholds, indicates low-priority zones warranting only basic monitoring. The second quadrant, where X7 exceeds its threshold while X1 remains below its critical value, demarcates source-control priority zones where engineering measures to reduce material accumulation should be emphasized. The third quadrant, characterized by X1 values above the threshold while X7 remains below its critical level, identifies hydrological management priority zones where drainage improvements and runoff control should be prioritized. The fourth quadrant, where both X7 and X1 exceed their respective thresholds, delineates comprehensive intervention zones requiring integrated approaches combining multiple strategies. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.g013 Building on identified risk factors and thresholds, this section evaluates the comparative efficacy of different risk reduction approaches, providing quantitative insights for evidence-based disaster management decision-making. Figs 14(a) and 14(b) present comparative risk response curves for interventions targeting X7 and X1, respectively. The analysis reveals that reducing maximum 24-hour rainfall X1 from 29.5 mm to 27.0 mm yields a 58.8% risk reduction, while reducing potential source energy X7 from 8.0 × 109 J/m2 to 3.0 × 109 J/m2 achieves a 25.0% risk diminution. This substantial difference in intervention efficacy provides clear guidance for resource allocation: rainfall control measures may yield faster risk reduction returns compared to source control measures. Figs 14(c) and 14(d) further refine this analysis through spatially-resolved risk reduction percentage contour maps, revealing that vulnerability mapping should identify transition zones where risk factors are marginally above threshold values, as modest interventions in these areas may yield substantial risk reduction. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.g014 Fig 15 presents SHAP force plots from representative data points selected through stratified random sampling, revealing substantial heterogeneity in localized risk factor compositions. This heterogeneity indicates that effective risk management requires location-specific approaches tailored to the dominant local risk factors. For implementation, this suggests customizing monitoring systems based on local risk factor compositions. Locations dominated by meteorological factors would benefit from enhanced weather-based warning systems with meteorological monitoring, while areas where topographical factors predominate would likely respond better to physical infrastructure interventions rather than precipitation-based warning systems. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.g015 Synthesizing these analytical results, a practical framework for precision debris flow risk management emerges with several actionable components. Early warning systems should implement rainfall thresholds that adjust based on source energy conditions rather than universal rainfall values, with lower rainfall thresholds applied in high source energy areas and higher thresholds in low energy areas. Beyond traditional rainfall monitoring, temperature and humidity sensors should be incorporated into monitoring networks, especially in areas where source energy exceeds the identified threshold. In resource-constrained environments, interventions should be sequenced according to threshold proximity, prioritizing areas just above threshold values where modest investments yield substantial risk reduction. Different zones require specific approaches: high-source energy zones warrant engineering interventions to reduce source material accumulation; critical rainfall zones require drainage improvements and runoff control; dual-threshold exceedance zones necessitate comprehensive management strategies incorporating both engineering measures and enhanced monitoring systems. Warning thresholds and monitoring intensity should be adjusted seasonally where temperature appears as a significant risk modifier, with heightened vigilance during periods exceeding 16°C. While the specific threshold values identified in this study are calibrated to the study area’s geological and climatological context, the methodological framework for threshold identification and factor interaction analysis remains transferable across diverse geographical settings, allowing regional calibration of specific thresholds while maintaining the structural integrity of the factor interaction paradigm. The stability of a model is crucial for reliable debris flow hazard prediction, as it ensures consistent results across multiple independent runs. To evaluate the stability of the IKOA-CNN-BiGRU-Attention model, 50 independent experiments were conducted, recording the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and their standard deviations (SD). Lower SD values indicate higher stability and consistency in predictions. As shown in Table 5 the IKOA-CNN-BiGRU-Attention model demonstrated minimal performance fluctuations, with an RMSE of 2.33 × 10−6 ± 1.51 × 10−7 and an MAE of 1.51 × 10−6 ± 1.10 × 10−7, outperforming all comparative models. These results highlight the model’s reliability and reproducibility, making it highly suitable for practical applications in debris flow hazard prediction. Its stable performance improves the credibility of risk assessments and provides robust technical support for disaster prevention and mitigation. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.t005 Robustness is essential for ensuring a model’s reliability when handling data disturbances such as noise or outliers, which are common in real-world geological and meteorological datasets. To evaluate the robustness of the IKOA-CNN-BiGRU-Attention model, random noise levels of 5%, 10%, and 20% were added to the test dataset to simulate possible data disturbances. The changes in performance metrics, including Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), were observed to determine the model’s ability to handle noisy data. As shown in Table 6, the IKOA-CNN-BiGRU-Attention model showed minimal performance degradation. When the noise level increased from 0% to 20%, the RMSE rose by only 7.9 × 10−7, and the MAE increased by approximately 4.9 × 10−7. Compared to other models, these slight increases demonstrate the strong robustness of the proposed model, which ensures high predictive accuracy even under noisy data conditions. This robustness confirms the model’s reliability in complex environments and enhances its applicability to practical disaster prevention and mitigation efforts. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.t006 The applicability of a model is crucial for assessing its practical value, particularly its suitability across different regions and datasets. To evaluate the applicability of the IKOA-CNN-BiGRU-Attention model, a 5-fold cross-validation experiment was conducted. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) were recorded for each fold to assess performance consistency. As shown in the results in Table 7, the RMSE ranged from 2.35 × 10−6 to 2.50 × 10−6, and the MAE ranged from 1.55 × 10−6 to 1.65 × 10−6, with minimal fluctuations across the folds. This consistent performance demonstrates the model’s strong applicability and stability, making it suitable for predicting debris flow hazards not only in the specific study area but also in other geographical regions. Its generalizability provides robust technical support for global disaster risk assessment and early warning efforts. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0326587.t007 This study proposes an integrated IKOA-CNN-BiGRU-Attention framework with SHAP explainability for high-precision debris flow hazard prediction that combines advanced optimization techniques, multidimensional deep learning architectures, and explainable AI mechanisms. Through systematic implementation and validation in the Nujiang River Basin, China, the study yields five principal contributions: The authors would like to acknowledge the support provided by the Information Technology Center, Zhejiang University.

Title: Meta’s Quest 3S Xbox Edition Is a Great Value, but There’s Just One Big Tradeoff

Microsoft wants everything to be an Xbox, but the problem with its ongoing ambition to rebrand every gaming-capable device as a pseudo gaming console is so few devices look like an Xbox. The next step on Microsoftâs wacky, winding road to regaining hardware supremacy is a $400 bundle that includes a Meta Quest headset with a unique colorway, an Xbox controller, and a few months of access to Game Pass Ultimate for game streaming. If you were looking to dip your toe into VR, the $300 Quest 3S is still your best option, and the bundle adds enough to make it worth the extra Benjamin. Just know that the Quest 3S’ displays don’t offer everything you truly want for a big picture VR gaming experience. Meta first hinted at a Meta Quest 3 Xbox Edition in 2023, around the time it offered users a native Xbox app for Meta Quest to enable easier game streaming. The $400 Xbox Edition Quest 3S doesnât let you play any of your Xbox games natively. All it truly provides is access to Microsoft’s streaming service, an extra Xbox controller, and the ergonomic Elite Strap that may help you game for longer without suffering a potential bout of neck strain. Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition The Xbox edition bundle is a great deal, plus the headset looks better in black. You just won't have the best displays for game streaming. Pros Cons Microsoft and Meta opting for the Quest 3S rather than the Quest 3 makes the bundle cheaper, but it’s less effective for game streaming. I’ve become very intimate with the Quest 3S since it hit the scene last year, and it’s what I usually suggest to anybody who wants to try VR without breaking the bank. However, the $500 Quest 3 has a wider, 110-degree horizontal FOV (field of view) compared to the 3S at 96 degrees. The more expensive headset also uses better-looking pancake lenses compared to the older and lesser-quality Fresnel lenses on whatâs normally a $300 headset. While they both have the same internal specs and performance, thereâs a clear visual quality difference between both VR headsets. If you were planning to buy a VR device mainly to do game streaming on a giant, virtual display, I would normally suggest you go for the one that will help your games look their best. The Quest 3S lenses are equivalent to what was on the QuestÂ 2, and the resulting image quality is slightly more grainy than what you get on a Quest 3. The Fresnel lenses combined with limited FOV can result in blurred images around the periphery of the display. This can make some text on notes in a game like Indiana Jones and the Great Circle nearly indecipherable unless you’re directly looking at that memento directly in front of you and from close up. It’s not unplayable, but it could make some games potentially annoying. While Game Pass is easily one of the best game streaming services available, the Quest 3S makes streaming pitfalls a little harder to navigate. Chief among them is lag. Games on Quest stream at 1,920×1,080 resolution, and Xbox Cloud Gaming suggests you have at least 20 Mbps internet speeds and a 5GHz Wi-Fi connection. Anything less, and you’ll experience input lag and blurred visuals. On the Quest 3S screens, any loss of visual clarity is so glaring that normally beautiful titles like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 appear like a pixelated mosaic. Speaking of Clair Obscur, you need very stable gameplay to hit those tight dodge or parry timings. I’m already terrible at hitting a parry, so suffering a team wipe because of lag is worse than agonizing. If you donât own a controller that pairs well with Quest 3S, the Xbox Edition has a fair amount of value for what you get. The Elite Strapâwhich offers better comfort than the default headbandânormally retails for $70. The controllerâs suggested retail price sits at around $65. Three months of Game Pass Ultimate would set you back another $60. Overall, you save $95 compared to buying everything separately, though you’ll need to spend $20 per month later to maintain access to game streaming. If you were buying outside the bundle, you could get a $400 Quest 3S with 256GB of storage compared to 128GB. If you plan to use your headset for game streamingâwhether through Xbox or Steam Link to hit up PCVR titlesâyou wonât have many issues with running out of storage. Most games on the Meta Store donât take up much space either, so you should feel safe sticking with the smaller storage option. Beyond a good deal, what you really want from this special edition are the Xbox colors. Black and green are far more striking than the bland white of the last several Meta Quest headsets. The neon accents help sell it as a âgamer device,” enough that it shouldnât stick out standing shoulder to shoulder with your typical Razer PC gaming gear. The stock-standard Xbox controller is an oldie but goodie, and the green accents added to the joysticks lend it a little extra flair without being too overt. Outside of Apple with its $3,500 Vision Pro, Meta is one of the few players still interested in doing large-scale, cheap VR/XR headsets. In the same vein, Game Pass is still one of the best deals in gaming, though it has become more expensive as of late. Now that hardware like the Xbox Series X and individual games cost more, streaming is starting to appear more enticing. Even then, Microsoft has promised a whole âfamilyâ of new hardware devices that includes an Xbox-branded handheld PC made by Asus. In that case, Microsoft is reengineering its Windows operating system to provide a more console-like experience. That canât be the case with a Meta Quest that uses the companyâs own Horizon OS. Until we see where Microsoft next takes us on its grand gaming journey, weâll probably see even more devices that look a little more like an Xbox.

Good morning. Hallam Bullock here, writing to you from London. A former animation president at Warner Bros. and Comcast's DreamWorks is betting he can create the next Hollywood franchises with the help of AI — and just raised $11.6 million to do it. In today's big story, US President Donald Trump announced a cease-fire between Iran and Israel. Israel says Iran has violated it. We're looking at how the markets are reacting — and what they're expecting next. What's on deck Markets: Real-estate investors are no longer counting out San Francisco. Tech: Leaked files and the startup's own contractors are calling Scale AI's security into question. Business: Why we should all know less about each other at work. But first, the markets are hopeful. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. "Please do not violate it!" US President Donald Trump said in a Truth Social post earlier this morning. He was referring to a cease-fire between Iran and Israel, which Trump said was "now in effect." It was the news the markets had been waiting for. European and US stock-index futures both jumped, while the dollar fell against all its major peers and gold, a safe haven asset, dropped 1.3%. Oil prices, meanwhile, continued their plunge. Hours later, Israel's defense minister said Iran had violated the cease-fire — and vowed to respond with "powerful strikes against regime targets in the heart of Tehran." Iran has denied the accusation. BI is covering this developing story. Follow our coverage. In many cases, the traditional risk-off response would've hampered the early-morning market rally, yet US stock futures are still firmly up. While the latest developments appear to signal a renewed escalation, markets are reacting as if this is a temporary disruption in an otherwise steady move toward de-escalation. We saw a similar thing yesterday, when Iran said it fired missiles at a US military base in Qatar. Fears of supply disruption would normally send oil prices up, but the attack was largely believed to be symbolic — Trump thanked Iran for giving the US "early notice, which made it possible for no lives to be lost." Oil prices continued to fall. Investors had also been pricing in geopolitical risks for months. "There wasn't much in the way of escalation so markets breathed a sigh of relief," Paul Hickey, cofounder of Bespoke Investment Group, told BI. We might be witnessing a similar scenario play out. A cease-fire hangs in the balance, but amid a cloud of uncertainty, it seems the markets are holding their nerve. 1. Don't get too excited about Tesla's stock jump, UBS says. The EV-maker's stock leapt 11% Monday morning after its robotaxi launch, but UBS said the opportunity is "already priced into the stock" in a note. Tesla's stock has been on a wild ride this year and is still down 13.6% YTD. 2. San Francisco could be in for a real estate rebound. The city is buzzing again thanks to RTO mandates. While the average rent price is still below pre-pandemic levels, they're predicted to tick up. Large investors are aiming to capitalize on a rebound by buying up multi-family homes. 3. The housing market is slowly turning in favor of buyers. A Redfin report showed US home prices rose 0.7% in May, the smallest increase since 2023. They expect this trend to continue and potentially start showing year-on-year declines by the end of 2025. 1. Scale AI's data security problem. The startup, which uses public Google Docs to track internal work for its high-profile clients, has left multiple AI training docs labeled "confidential" accessible to anyone with a link, BI has found. While there's no indication that Scale AI's practices have caused a breach, one expert called it "dangerous." 2. Leave a tip? JK! Tesla's robotaxi service trolls users who try to tip their non-human drivers, some commuters discovered shortly after the robotaxi launch in Austin. See what happens when you try. 3. Chatbots are competing for users on WhatsApp. The messaging app, owned by Meta, is "the largest surface that people use Meta AI on," according to Mark Zuckerberg. It's also becoming an AI free-for-all as rival chatbots compete for audiences, which could hurt Meta's quest to become the default AI provider, BI's Pranav Dixit writes. 1. Make coworkers mysterious again. It's good that workplaces have become more inviting, but there's a cost to sharing too much. Besides annoying coworkers and managers, oversharing can hurt an employee's reputation and their organization's, writes BI's Emily Stewart. 2. Compass is lawyering up to fight Zillow. The real estate brokerage accused Zillow of violating antitrust laws by forcing listings onto its platform in a lawsuit filed Monday. Zillow has been beefing with big brokerages since they started gatekeeping certain listings, arguing that they're creating an uneven playing field for homebuyers. 3. DTC bedding brand Parachute folds 19 stores. Parachute shrank its retail footprint from 26 to seven storefronts over the past year, becoming the latest direct-to-consumer brand that's struggled to scale or turn a profit. It said it plans to focus on e-commerce and partnerships with retailers like Target instead. New York City primary mayoral election.

Title: The Best Growth Mutual Funds To Fuel Long-Term Capital Growth

ByCatherine Brock ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. In investing, patience is rewarded. Mutual funds can deliver on several investment goals, with capital appreciation being near the top of the list. Growth mutual funds consolidate fast-moving companies into one portfolio, which can yield exciting results. The funds highlighted below cover a range of exposures and include both active and passive management styles. Despite the strategy differences, they align on the objective of delivering above-market returns for their shareholders. This list of growth mutual fund picks includes options targeting a range of exposures, from up-and-coming domestic small caps to foreign multinationals. They additionally meet these criteria: The table below highlights six top growth mutual funds that meet the noted parameters. Reviews of each fund follow. FECGX by the numbers: Fidelity's small cap growth fund tracks the Russell 2000 Growth Index. The index includes Russell 2000 companies that outperform peers on EPS growth and sales per share growth. The average five-year EPS growth for the group is 18.66%, about 50% higher than the 12.29% growth average among broader Russell 2000 companies. Historically, small caps have provided important diversification for stock portfolios. Smaller companies are riskier and more volatile, because they can have less predictable business performance and reduced access to capital. But smaller companies can grow faster than bigger ones, as they did between 2000 and 2012. While large caps have been dominant in recent years, many analysts believe this is a cyclical trend that will reverse itself. A conservative position in small caps prepares you for that reversal. FMDGX by the numbers: The Fidelity Mid Cap Growth Index Fund replicates the performance of the Russell Mid Cap Growth Index. The index isolates the growth-oriented companies of the Russell Mid Cap Index. These fast-movers are identified by high price-to-book ratios, two-year growth outlooks and historic sales per share growth. High-growth mid caps are poised to become the next large caps. Companies to watch in this portfolio include the AI darling Palantir Technologies (PLTR) and crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN). Middle-sized companies are more nimble than large caps and more stable than small caps. They can outpace large companies when the economy is expanding and they hold up better than small companies when the economy is contracting. Mid caps can also offer cheaper valuations than large caps—though Palantir is a notable exception. SWLGX by the numbers: Schwab’s large-cap growth fund invests in the Russell 1000 Growth Index. The index includes growth stocks that are also among the 1,000 largest U.S. companies by market capitalization. In five of the last six years, SWLGX has produced annual returns from 27.53% to 42.66%. 2022 was the exception; a broad technology sell-off in that year pushed SWLGX to a 29.16% decline. SWLGX has more than 50% concentration in the Magnificent Seven stocks: Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG) and Tesla (TSLA). The group earned the name by driving much of the S&P 500 gains in recent years. Given their collective performance, it’s hard not to prioritize them in a growth portfolio. Beyond the Magnificent Seven, SWLGX also includes payment processor Visa (V), pharma stock Eli Lilly (LLY), club store Costco (COST) and Home Depot (HD)—solid performers in their own right. ANWPX by the numbers: The New Perspective Fund invests in stocks that benefit from growing global trade. Portfolio companies are multinationals, each with a significant business presence outside their home country. About 53% of the fund's assets are U.S. equities, 43% is in foreign stocks and the remainder is held in cash. ANWPX is an actively managed fund, meaning the fund managers are making strategic trading decisions—rather than relying on an index to define the portfolio. Active funds can and sometimes do beat the market but they also charge a higher expense ratio than index funds. ANWPX has made the trade-off worthwhile in recent years, outperforming the MSCI All Country World Index and the Morningstar Global Large-Stock Growth category average in the prior 10-year and five-year periods. The portfolio includes many recognizable names in a composition you won't find in an index fund. Top holdings include Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Taiwan Semiconductor (TSMC) and French eyewear company EssilorLuxottica (ESLOF). VINEX by the numbers: The Vanguard International Explorer Fund invests in smaller growth companies located outside the U.S. The focus is on developed markets in Europe and the Pacific, though emerging markets stocks comprise 7.4% of the assets. The portfolio's median market capitalization is $4 billion, and its earnings growth rate is 14.6%. VINEX provides diversified exposure to foreign small caps—about 350 companies spread across 20 countries. The fund can be volatile, but the portfolio has strongly outperformed U.S. small caps in the last year, returning 12.52% compared to FECGX’s 3.5% return. Due to its volatility, you would hold this fund in a relatively small proportion alongside larger positions in domestic and foreign large caps. VWIGX by the numbers: VWIGX invests in non-U.S. large caps with growth characteristics. Portfolio companies are primarily located in Europe (48.6%), emerging markets (21.1%), the Pacific (17.2%) and North America (12.2%). The fund's median market cap is $90.4 billion and the earnings growth rate is 25.3%. Vanguard’s international large-cap growth fund holds interesting companies that may be too volatile for most investors to hold as individual positions. Examples include ecommerce giant MercadoLibre (MELI), Chinese tech company BYD (BYDDY) and Dutch semiconductor company ASML Holding NV. VWIGX earned a Silver rating from Morningstar in 2025, for excelling in process, performance, people, parent and price. The fund has a long-term focus, but its managers occasionally make opportunistic moves into stocks with trend-driven upside or those with underestimated potential. The fund can be volatile, so most investors will hold it as a diversifier rather than a core position. Bottom Line Growth investing is high risk and high reward. You can mitigate some risk through diversification and long holding periods. The diversification limits your dependence on one company, industry or economy. And long holding periods prevent you from realizing losses created by short-term volatility. In investing, patience is rewarded.

Title: Apple might buy Perplexity AI to bolster AI division

Apple is still considering its AI moves, and now it seems like the startup Perplexity might be on the menu. A new report from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman says that Apple is weighing the pros and cons of an acquisition that could help it acquire more AI talent and products. On the flip side, there are reports that Apple might partner with the company instead of buying it. This partnership could lead to an AI search engine powered by Perplexity and integrating the company’s tech into Siri. The report says Apple has made no formal offers, but has met with the company several times lately. This deal and/or partnership is likely spurred by two things. First is the potential for Apple and Google’s deal for search on iPhone to evaporate as U.S. courts look at Google as a monopoly on the search market. Apple is also seen as behind the competition in AI, and a major move like this is bound to be good for the stock price. The Bloomberg report mentions that Google’s stock fell a point after the news went live about Apple’s possible AI acquisition. There’s also some speculation that Sam Altman and OpenAI’s deal with ex-Apple design legend Jony Ive on some AI hardware might be putting pressure on Apple to get into the AI game sooner rather than later. That being said, Apple is working on its own AI tools, so it’s likely a matter of how long it thinks those will take to make and how much the company actually cares about what Wall Street thinks. There is an argument to be made that with Apple’s dominant market share in the iPhone, it can likely afford to be a few years late to the AI game, especially since we’ve seen so many issues with the current crop of generative and search AI tools. However, previous reports said Apple’s top executives are split on AI adoption, so things might be stalling in either direction. The report also mentions that Meta has already made an offer to buy Perplexity, but the companies couldn’t come to an agreement, so Meta invested in Scale AI. Perplexity’s CEO says that Meta even tried to poach them for its ‘Superintelligence’ team. Meta has also approached staff from OpenAI and offered salaries with $100 million signing bonuses. Meta’s investment in Scale was US$14.3 billion, (C$19.6 billion), so it stands to reason that the company offered a similar deal to Perplexity. The AI startup is valued at US$14 billion (C$19 billion) after its last funding round, so I expect it will cost even more if Apple wants to buy the company. The big question I have at this point is, if Apple is considering making big AI moves, will that delay some of the already announced features, like the Siri enhancements we’ve been waiting for since WWDC in 2024?

Title: Coffee Break: Nihilists at Google Wrecking Existing Business to Chase AI Growth
URL: https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/?p=294347
Time Published: 2025-06-23T18:00:03Z
Full Content:
In 2016 Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced that “in the long run, we’re evolving in computing from a ‘mobile-first’ to an ‘AI-first’ world.” In 2018, he famously told Kara Swisher that AI is “one of the most important things that humanity is working on. It’s more profound than, I don’t know, electricity or fire.” It’s generally over-looked that he opened that statement by saying “We don’t take a very optimistic view of AI” and closed by responding to Swisher’s comment that “fire is pretty good” with “(fire) kills people too, we have learned to harness fire for the benefits of humanity but we have to overcome its downsides too.” And yet, just over four years later Pichai, by then also CEO of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, issued a ‘code red’ and directed multiple department heads including those in charge of research, trust, and safety “to switch gears to assist in the development and launch of AI prototypes and products.” This directional switch took place only three weeks after the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT product. At the time, The New York Times warned that “because these new chat bots learn their skills by analyzing huge amounts of data posted to the internet, they have a way of blending fiction with fact” and “that could turn people against Google and damage the corporate brand it has spent decades building.” The Times also quoted University of Washington professor Margaret O’Mara saying, “For companies that have become extraordinarily successful doing one market-defining thing, it is hard to have a second act with something entirely different.” That was in late 2022, as of mid-year 2025, it is clear that Pichai has damaged Google’s brand and its core search product in a seemingly competition with OpenAI. As I tried to understand what Pichai was doing, my initial framework was Cory Doctorow’s “enshittification” concept defined as when “vendors create high-quality offerings to attract users, then they degrade those offerings to better serve business customers, and finally degrade their services to users and business customers to maximize profits for shareholders.” Over the past year I’ve found Ed Zitron’s analysis of Google’s decision-making has deepened my understanding of WTF Pichai is up to. I’ll come back to Zitron in a moment, but for those new to his work, I’d recommend giving these three pieces a quick skim: I’ve also found pioneering AI researcher Gary Marcus’ work very useful — he flagged most of the limitations of LLM AI decades ago and has been consistently vindicated in his skepticism that the current OpenAI and Alphabet approach to AI will truly prove “as important as fire.” We’ll come back to Marcus too. But first I want to touch on an idea that Naked Capitalism readers have seen recently in another context via Curro Jimenez: nihilism. Curro was quoting the French sociologist Emmanuel Todd’s analysis of Israel’s recent behavior in Gaza and Iran and this quote jumped out at me: “Perhaps in the unconscious depths of the Israeli psyche, being Israeli today is no longer about being Jewish — it’s about fighting the Arabs.” I would argue that for Pichai and those remaining at Google under his leadership, being Google today is no longer about being the dominant search engine — it’s about fighting OpenAi/ChatGPT. On Wednesday, I’ll be applying Todd’s formulation to the current leadership of the Democratic party which is no longer about being the party of the working class but rather it’s about fighting off the progressive wing of the party. Now, let’s dive into Ed Zitron’s explanation of why Google is willing to risk its incredibly lucrative core search business and maybe even destroy the open web itself in a quest to compete with Open AI. Zitron is an effective polemicist so let’s let him cook a little: Google no longer provides the “best” result or answer to your query – it provides the answer that it believes is most beneficial or profitable to Google. Google Search provides a “free” service, but the cost is a source of information corrupted by a profit-seeking entity looking to manipulate you into giving money to the profit-seeking entities that pay them. The net result is a product that completely sucks. …That’s because Google has, like every major tech company, focused entirely on what will make revenues increase, even if the cost of doing so is destroying its entire legacy. Google has announced their own “Bard AI” to compete with Bing’s ChatGPT integration, and I’ll be honest – I feel a little crazy that nobody is saying the truth, which is that Google broke the product that made them famous and is now productizing fixing their own problem as innovation. … Venture capital and the public markets don’t actually reward or respect “good” businesses or “good” CEOs – they reward people that can steer the kind of growth that raises the value of an asset. …Sundar Pichai isn’t paid $280 million a year because he’s a “good CEO.” After all, Google has all but destroyed its search product. He’s paid because he finds ways to increase the overall growth of the company (even while their cloud division still loses money), and thus the stock goes up. Zitron expanded on these ideas in his “Business Idiot” piece: Our economy is run by people that don’t participate in it and our tech companies are directed by people that don’t experience the problems they allege to solve for their customers, as the modern executive is no longer a person with demands or responsibilities beyond their allegiance to shareholder value. The incentives behind effectively everything we do have been broken by decades of neoliberal thinking, where the idea of a company — an entity created to do a thing in exchange for money —has been drained of all meaning beyond the continued domination and extraction of everything around it, focusing heavily on short-term gains and growth at all costs. In doing so, the definition of a “good business” has changed from one that makes good products at a fair price to a sustainable and loyal market, to one that can display the most stock price growth from quarter to quarter. Ewan Morrison elegantly summarized why Pinchai’s commitment to AI is so riskly to its search business and the Open Web itself: One drop of sewage in a glass of water turns the entire glass into sewage.This is happening with AI hallucinated facts on the internet. AI systems have 48% error margins & are turning our historical, news, philosophical & scientific info on the net into sewage.Do not drink it. pic.twitter.com/nN0dhV9Dg2 — Ewan Morrison (@MrEwanMorrison) June 19, 2025 And like Captain Ahab, Pinchai knows he must have a crew just as dedicated to his suicidal mission as he is. He might not be nailing a gold coin to the mast and demanding loyalty oaths, but he is aggressively pushing buy-out offers on Googlers who are not down with the program: Remember Google is offering buyouts to employees who aren’t all-in on how the company is doing things and it’s “AI first” direction. Sadly, I have to think that still working for Google at this point means they support what’s happened and how the company intends to become an an answer engine. — Katherine Argent (@effthealgorithm) June 21, 2025 Let me wrap with a couple of paragraphs from Freddie de Boer about the issues the whole of tech faces and why it thinks AI is the answer: the hype is a phenomenon driven by needs that are fundamentally financial in origin. The tech companies need a new suite of products that can restore their eroding profitability and inspire the public the way that the public was inspired in the late 2000s and early 2010s; the financial sector and investors need the tech companies to be the unicorn stocks that they once were. As usual with speculative capitalism, the tail is wagging the dog. When hockey stick growth does not emerge naturally from reality, it will be invented. Media hype about AI, the almost literal absence of any countervailing narrative, the relentless way that the stodgiest publications inflate the threats/hopes that have been invested in these technologies… it’s all downstream of the desire to feel about tech the way people did in the Obama era and the demand from the moneyed to have the right lottery tickets to buy. A lot of people who are used to getting what they want are looking to let the good times roll again, and “AI” is precisely the kind of vague instrument into which they can throw those hopes. Anyone who points out that the emperor has no clothes is simply told that they don’t understand the technology, and every year that goes by that human life is not seriously disrupted by this technology is just a minor delay. Rinse and repeat. In future posts, I’ll look at other players in the AI space — OpenAI, Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple. Veteran political operative and corporate media professional. Tech billionaires have debunked the myth that private companies produce the best products. They charge the highest prices for the lowest quality products. The solution is clear: nationalize search engines and AI. Hey, it worked for Larry Ellison / Oracle. Everyone else is just following in his footsteps. Some would point to IBM as the original innovator in this space. The rot goes way back. You can nationalize the industry, or the industry can privatize the government. As things stand, the top echelons of the tech giants see their interests largely aligned with the ideologues and bureaucrats and power-seekers in the state apparatus. A new trend is top dudes at Palantir and other companies joining the army (and immediately being promoted to Lt. Col.). It goes both ways. Privatizing will work until it doesn’t. Expect catabolic disruption in the coming year as capabilities get converted to cash leaving nonfunctional systems, not obviously reparable. Mariana Mazzucato in ‘The Entrepreneurial State” discusses the contribution of state funded, mostly university based, R&D, including blue sky research, and covers the big Pharma low risk predisposition. She uses the i-phone case study, as GPS, touch screens and other essential component technologies were all state funded. However, she doesn’t evaluate state directed research against resource consumption, so any comprehensive systems analysis. The values applied often involve military uses, such as through DARPA, but sustainability or social usefulness is more spinoff than deliberate. In the 250 years since the Industrial Revolution we don’t seem to have learned that purely profit oriented development is often damaging both to society and environment. The US definitely has an issue with short-term thinking, and that influences how the gov’t and companies interact with AI, but there’s a lot more going on. Russian President Putin said he was treating AI as on par with nukes in strategic importance. The capacity for AI-enabled weapons to transform war means those who don’t have it are severe underdogs. And while there’s a lot of “ai slop” there is a lot of genuinely impressive capability that is consistently improving, even with occasional bad updates, enshittification, short-term incentives, and so on. Self driving cars are a real thing, esp in China. Autonomous drone swarms that self-select their targets are real. AI isn’t going away, and it will only get better (at least for the paying customers, if not for consumers of “free” services who are actually the ‘product’). Just because US companies are structurally stupid (because the owners enforce short term thinking on executives) doesn’t mean AI is not a game changer. Fundamentally, what is google? A search engine! what does a search engine do? It connects people with the information or resources they seek. That is what Chatgpt does, but in a much more engaging direct way (at least by many users’ standards). To get the ‘answer’ directly instead of sifting through industry technical standards, endless usenet forums, news website archives, or whatever data source – that’s a big shift, and clearly it’s possible even if now it’s not yet super reliable. That’s why one of Google’s top execs recently said something like “we will go bankrupt before we lose the AI race”. Their search was already degrading years ago and financially they were doing just fine. But this LLM chat-interface really could eat their lunch, and they see that. It sounds like they don’t know how to preserve their ad biz just yet, but they know they need to be at the forefront of this new tech and rebuilding their revenue streams to incorporate it, not hold on to an old model that just won’t be as competitive. There’re are a lot of reasons to be upset with Google, but their embrace of LLM-based interactions at the search page backed by their traditional search engine seems smart to me. Separate from the chat interface is LLMs’ reasoning capability, or ability to connect disparate data points in meaningful ways. That will transform search. Google would be foolish not to go head first into this and get the best people and capabilities early on. Don’t get me wrong, I think AI is a disaster for humanity and it’s already having lots of terrible impacts, as NC had documented. But I think ragging on Google for trying to jump on this new tech is not acknowledging the situation they’re in, or the likely future abilities of the tech. Google search sucks because they refused to filter out the spam, because the spam was what brought in the revenue. However: It connects people with the information or resources they seek. That is what Chatgpt does, but in a much more engaging direct way (at least by many users’ standards). To get the ‘answer’ directly The ‘answer’, right or wrong, with no way to evaluate it’s veracity. At least you were honest enough to put it in quotes. If this is the direction society is going, we’re doomed. The FDA evaluating drug safety on what AI halucinates from the swamp of anti-vax drek? EPA deciding pollution rules based on the weight of anti-regulation spam out there? Building codes revised to reflect opinion pieces by developers and material vendors? Because that’s all that AI is – it’s running a popularity contest to see what the most probable ‘answer’ is for any input. That results (for now) seem reasonable is just because the spam hasn’t had a chance to overwhelm the valid, human generated content. Just wait. Completely agree. The ‘answer’, right or wrong, with no way to evaluate it’s veracity. I don’t use Chrome or Google search, but this makes me appreciate Brave browser’s Leo AI in search, which at least cites each website as the source(s) for each detail in its “answer,” and gives links to each cited website below that “answer,” making it easy to click through to verify. But yeah, as we all seem to agree, AI ain’t a thing to celebrate. Sorry, you are kidding yourself. AI had been caught out repeatedly fabricating sources You cannot trust its sourcing. DO NOT USE AI for research, FFS. It isn’t even OK for transcriptions, as IM Doc has reported long form. That’s not true, it’s quite possible to verify a LLM response’s veracity. At the end of your query, add a clause to give citations. I never make a query without doing this. And then I always check the links, as I would with wikipedia. Essentially I just use it to point me to the original source material. It’s been helpful a number of times. This also helps me keep tabs on how often the AI makes shit up, and when. Ha ha. And how many people know to do this? 0.00..01%? Or bother? But they’ll act on the ‘answer’ nonetheless. And what makes you think the citations aren’t hallucinations? And what makes you confident Google et al won’t conveniently change their query processing to ignore your clause, as they’ve done with boolean operators, “exact” match clauses and uncountable other changes they’ve snuck in on the sly? But you do you. Self driving cars are a real thing, esp in China. Autonomous drone swarms that self-select their targets are real. These examples are based on pattern matching, which is something that certain AI technologies can do pretty well. Don’t confuse these with llvm applications, which try to find the the most probable series of human authored tokens in their training data to correspond to a prompt. I don’t anticipate anything good or useful coming out of llvm, partly because of its high error rate, and partly because of its tendency to corrupt future training data. LLMs have no reasoning capability. Agreed. This whole phrase is utter nonsense: “LLMs’ reasoning capability, or ability to connect disparate data points in meaningful ways” I don’t buy it. There are many kinds of reasoning. Some kinds AI is terrible at, and some it’s very impressive at. People’s definition of “reasoning” is changing dramatically, as AI is proving more and more capable. Obviously there are huge reasoning gaps, but they’re shrinking, and much of the pattern matching is simply good enough for many applications if used carefully. Look at geo-guessr. A huge amount of deductive reasoning goes into deciding on a location from clues in the picture. I also know two people who got better medical advice from chatGPT than actual doctors, for non-trivial problems, and in one person’s case it’s been a helpful ongoing consultant. Again, I’m no fanboy and mostly avoid AI and LLMs especially. And I’m very willing to ack the drawbacks and negative influences on society which are copious. But let’s acknowledge the capabilities that are there. No, your assumption is false. First, AI does not and never reasons. Saying it does is a massive category error. Second, LLMs will never never never have enough source material on which to train. So they train on other LLM generated material. That generates more errors over time. It’s a multiplying “garbage in, garbage out” problem. Narrow AI (like reading certain types of images) may perform well, but not the ones you encounter most often, the LLM. There are many articles like this if you would listen to something other than the hype: LLMs are getting dumber and we have no idea why https://www.ignorance.ai/p/llms-are-getting-dumber-and-we-have AI Hallucinations Are Getting Worse. What Can We Do About It? https://builtin.com/articles/ai-hallucinations-worsening-solutions Newer LLM models are getting worse https://www.linkedin.com/posts/richardselfllm_this-is-interesting-the-newer-llm-models-activity-7330013445070741505-_6cj I’ll circle back to ChatGPT and the fundamental reason it is not going to replace Google search. Ed Zitron has demonstrated beyond a doubt that it is not financially viable, not at the free level, not at the premium level. Their last best hope seems to be a turn toward surveillance tech but they’re going up against Palantir and multiple incumbents there. Google’s P/E is down to 18, so lower and more normal compared to the rest of the tech sector (Apple, Microsoft and NVIDIA are all around 30-40, Meta is 25). So investors are increasingly valuing the stock based on actual revenue, not some nebulous growth potential. AI race is all about restoring the perception of these tech stock as having growth potential and pushing the P/E ratios back up without creating actual revenue. Short-term game because you can only maintain the illusion for so long, but enough to create substantial stock price growth for Pinchai and his buddies to collect their bonuses and cash out. Computer sub-literate here, so it’s a given that my opinion/analysis transacts at a very high discount, but I still have to rhetorically ask: if AI is being trained on an ever-increasing mass of Internet data, ever more of which is trash/increasingly enshittified, then isn’t it inherently entropic? We know too well the quality of it most Internet content, and I assume it exceeds the amount of pre-digital knowledge/information daily if not hourly. As humans become ever-more passive and stupefied by tech, why is AI not doomed to become the equivalent of a fiftieth-generation photocopy, or Gresham’s Law applied to information science? See, it doesn’t take an engineering degree to see the basic fallacy at play! You are entirely correct. Your intuition is correct and has already been confirmed scientifically. Not that those mega-corporations care much about it… Maybe AI will kill these corporations and their leaders if this is to be believed: https://www.newsweek.com/ai-kill-humans-avoid-shut-down-report-2088929 Yes. Essentially it is exactly what it says it is, a Probability engine based on a Large Language Model database that includes all inputs stored in that database, good or bad, scientifically valid and invalid, copyright protected or not. And now I will break for lunch… hopefully the wood glue has kept the cheese from sliding off my pizza and onto the broiler floor. Another illustration of this was the Facebook experiment (in 2017 I think) where they had two AI chatbots talk/negotiate with each other. They ended up both speaking in gibberish (which was framed as ‘inventing their own language’) before being shut down. In hindsight, it was a good example of a closed AI loop with no human input eventually becoming unstable. Both of them were operating on content completely different from their training set, resulting in unpredictable and degenerate output, which then fed back into the input and contributed further to the problem. Thank you for this post. I find much of what Ed Zitron has to say, e.g., on tech companies and their CEOs in general, fairly perceptive. He identifies the fundamental problem of scaling in gen AI (similar to that which Yves has identified for blockchain), in his post There Is No AI Revolution: Putting aside the hype and bluster, OpenAI — as with all generative AI model developers — loses money on every single prompt and output. Its products do not scale like traditional software, in that the more users it gets, the more expensive its services are to run because its models are so compute-intensive. And later, The only product that OpenAI has succeeded in scaling to the mass market is the free version of ChatGPT, which loses the company money with every prompt. This scale isn’t a result of any kind of product-market fit. It’s entirely media-driven, with reporters making “ChatGPT” synonymous with “artificial intelligence.” my pleasure as always to post for this wonderful community. And yes, Zitron and Gary Marcus are my go-tos on AI scepticism. Zitron on the business side and Marcus on the tech fundamentals. We are in the midst of the biggest Ponzi scheme in human history. “still working at Google at this point” might also mean that most workers, even highly paid tech workers, are still workers that rely on a paycheck and have to make choices in life in regards to what kinds of principals you can eat and what kind you cannot eat. Oh, what a world where we could all say fock you to the American capitalist elite and just quit this exploitative system en mass. I occasionally use AI to to double check that I have covered most or all of the relevant bases of subjects I once knew well but I haven’t looked at for some stretch of time. It’s truly amazing how much BS hallucination gets injected as fact, which someone with even a rusty degree of subject matter expertise might easily catch, but think of the poor souls who used AI to breeze through their education or training, and who haven’t developed the critical eye to help them distinguish actual fact from AI fact. AI is the super-highway to Idiocracy. Excellent post and comments. For my part I did a Google search on Ahab’s gold coin because high school was long ago and I wanted a refresher. The Wikipedia article on the Moby Dick coin is pretty good, but I wanted to go a bit deeper. That led me to using ChatGPT with the following transcript: https://chatgpt.com/share/6859bdda-f50c-8004-940c-f7a995af0e2d showing it’s not just math errors you have to watch out for. I just find it remarkable that this glib AI pretends to know so much, spins unsupported theories, asserts easily discovered falsehoods, and is obsequious but not regretful when confronted. Reminds me of certain annoying people from high school. Back then people would have blamed the parents, which seems even more justified here and now. Just when you do a Google search these days you get the AI answer at the top of the results. Sometimes they give good leads but that is what the original search page did. But often it totally misunderstands the query and gives information of something completely different and is akin to asking a stranger a question who makes up an answer rather than admit that they do not know or are guessing at the answer. We have been finding that the first pages of “results” from our Google searches are now all infotainment and commercial ads disguised as “information.” Earlier years of Google search showed how good results can be provided to the questioner. This proves that the system can be designed to function for the searcher’s benefit. Today’s Google search is proof that the “service’s” core function has been deliberately degraded to rent seeking behaviour. Stay safe…information now available for a small fee from Google! thank you for the kind words and the analysis of AI’s summary of Ahab’s speech. Oh the lulz. Sometimes it pays to be old. I need to find a new copy to replace my long lost copy from 1976 and re-read Computer Power and Human Reason. Joseph Weizenbaum was right when I was the youngest guy in the lab and he is still right when I am the oldest guy in the lab. The noise-to-signal ratio is a lot higher now, though. YMMV but I seem to have found that presearch.com works fairly well. Almost 60 years ago, a text by Mortimer Taube has been published that anticipates much of nowadays discussions about AI: “Computers and Common Sense – the Myth of Thinking Machines”. Still holds. Interesting article, Nat, and it’s great to see these topics covered on NC. I think I disagree with some of the reasoning behind Google’s pivot to AI. It’s not wrong to say the Google search sucks and Google’s prioritization of their ad revenue has made their core product worse. This also comes at a time when Google has to share more and more of its ad market with competitors. No, I think this pivot to AI is a part of a strategic shift for Google. Cloud hosting is much harder for competitors to break into due to the amount of physical investment, and its customer base is much less fickle than ad firms. If consumer markets tank (as I’m sure they will, soon), cloud hosting will still be immensely important for most institutions, governments, and militaries. Sure, firms everywhere are planning on replacing their workers with ChatGPT, which almost definitely will not work, but many in the military are salivating over the potential AI can play in streamlining intelligence gathering, targeting, and offloading the liability of killing. Breaking into military contracting is no easy task, as the majority of this sector has been monopolised by Raytheon and the like for decades now. With Google’s cloud offerings like Project Nimbus, the Israelis are allowing the IDF to easily build and host AI systems to conduct their genocide; they have the perfect testing ground for future product offerings to both the US military and beyond. Big, billion-dollar contracts in a sector where there will only be a few competitors (Amazon, Microsoft, and to a lesser extent, Oracle) sound a whole lot better than trying to save a faltering product like Google search when it’d be too little, too late. thank you NM. It’s entirely possible you’re correct. Google execs just have to be smarter than I’m giving them credit for or its the biggest deliberate destruction of shareholder capital in my lifetime. Amazon, Oracle and MSFT are definitely using AI to make cloudside plays but I don’t see Google cracking the top 3. However I think there remains a multi-trillion dollar opportunity in delivering high quality search — you know, the kind Google had up to about 2015 or so. It may be a situation where we are both correct to an extent. Don’t forget that Alphabet also owns DeepMind, which I would argue is one of the largest AI companies (that has certainly been overshadowed by others like OpenAI recently). In the Project Nimbus contract (the deal between the Israeli state and AWS and Google Cloud to build 6 “soverign” data centres), Israel stated specifically that they chose Google and AWS over Microsoft and Oracle because of their increased AI capabilities. I did a factual Google search yesterday, with its now automatic AI synopsis, but more in hope than expectation. This was for the full line-up of a one day rock festival I attended in London on May 7th 1972 which gig included both top British and American acts. It was a sellout, with 10,000 there. Yet, apart from one headliner, there is no accurate information – no-one seems to have documented this one-off. Most bands have their own (often obsessive) biographers with tours and gig lists. Most classic venues have their own proud historians. Details often even go as far as set lists, timings, and band members. Google AI then invented a line-up, including merging rock bands and acts who were not there but who performed at other 1972 UK rock festivals, (Reading is 50m away from London) and even adding in from tours in different years. The AI account was totally fictional, hopefully not in a deliberate Orwellian disinformation mode, but with an exceptionally high “Garbage In, Garbage Out” quotient. How harmful can AI be when it is incredible, and with such a low level of accuracy ? This level of factual precision, masquerading as being both an ‘intelligent’ and reliable response, is positively harmful, if there is any genuine expectation of believability. It was as fake as a White House briefing. I’ll suggest that there is a threshold, say the Leavitt threshold of truth, against which current and future AI is measured. The question then arises as to whether any real world decision making ought ever to be left to AI generated material, when even a simple rock concert lineup ends up as distorted as a hall of mirrors. For all I love about NC, this is one of the most insightful comment threads I’ve ever witnessed. As a reader of NC for over 20 years I am truly humble to have posted the post that triggered this conversation. GOOGL doesn’t want to get lapped by a new technology. See companies like Kodak and Blockbuster that failed to adapt. This is more like Kodak choosing to abandon film for disappearing ink technology than any kind of film vs digital ink debate.

Title: Hinge CEO Justin McLeod says dating AI chatbots is ‘playing with fire’

The head of Hinge on AI, monetization, and the future of online dating. The head of Hinge on AI, monetization, and the future of online dating. Today, I’m talking with Hinge founder and CEO Justin McLeod. Hinge is one of the biggest dating apps in the United States — it’s rivaled only by Tinder, and both are owned by the massive conglomerate Match Group, which has consolidated a huge chunk of the online dating ecosystem. A fair warning here: I’ve never actually used a dating app — the algorithm that matched my wife and me was the university housing lottery, which put us in adjacent dorm rooms in the fall of 2000. And my wife is now a divorce lawyer, so playing around with these apps seems a little bit risky. So I always end up approaching conversations about dating apps a little bit removed. Listen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems. Subscribe here! I asked Justin what it’s like to be the married CEO of a dating app company who doesn’t use his own product anymore, especially as his own personal romantic journey is very intertwined with Hinge. The entire idea of the company and how it has evolved over the years connects to Justin’s own life and his decision to reconnect with his college girlfriend, just a month before she was supposed to marry someone else. The story is so unbelievable that it was turned into an episode of Netflix’s Modern Love. You’ll hear Justin explain how that experience connects to the company’s values, culture, and his vision of what Hinge is really for — and how all of that is geared toward helping people find lasting connections. Hinge bills itself as the app that’s “designed to be deleted,” and that, of course, is in deep tension with how mobile apps and services grow users and revenue. Then there is the AI of it all. Hinge, as part of Match Group, is using AI both internally and within its product, just as Tinder and other competitors are. There’s AI coaching features to help you improve your profile, pick better photos, and even catch an inappropriate message before it gets sent. But pull the string on all these ideas, and you get to a place where people might be talking to AI all the time, even falling in love with it, or having AI agents dating each other before meeting in person. Justin had some pretty strong feelings about the importance of centering real human connection and encouraging people to put their phones down and go out on dates in the real world. Justin also called the idea of AI companionship “playing with fire” and compares those relationships to junk food. There’s a lot more in this conversation. We got on the topic of the Trump administration and how seriously Hinge takes the privacy of its users’ data during an unprecedented crackdown on LGBTQ+ rights. We talked briefly about Apple and its App Store restrictions, now that companies like Epic Games and Match Group are free to send people to the web to process in-app purchases. Hinge has some plans that you’ll hear Justin get into near the end. There’s a lot going on in this one; you might even fall in love. Okay: Hinge CEO Justin McLeod. Here we go. This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. Justin McLeod, you’re the founder and CEO of Hinge. Welcome to Decoder. Thanks for having me. I’m excited to talk to you. I’ve got to tell you, this is one where I feel like Jane Goodall or a sociologist of some kind. I’m old. I’m married to a divorce lawyer. I can’t even download this app. It’s too risky. I’m watching through the looking glass here. I asked my younger staff for their Hinge feature requests. Don’t worry, I’ve got a million of those. Great. Excited to hear those. When TaskRabbit comes on Decoder, I’m like, “I booked a TaskRabbit.” This is very different. When was the last time you actually used Hinge as a user? Over a decade ago. Wow. Yeah. What’s that like? What’s it like trying to run this team? Is it all just data driven for you, because there’s a real element of dogfooding here. Yes, definitely. We have a lot of single people on our team at Hinge, so there’s a lot of internal dogfooding for sure, and a lot of opinions. I think that the relationship is different. So, I started the company in 2011, and I was single at the time, and I was single for the first four years of Hinge, and then, long story: I got back together with my college girlfriend, and we’ve been together for the last 10 years, married with kids and all. Did you get back together on Hinge? We were together. I tried to get her back. She said no. I started Hinge in response to that. And then someone whom I met on Hinge inspired me to go back. She was about to get married to someone else. She was living in Switzerland. I flew over a month before the wedding. She called off her wedding and moved back to New York, which led to the whole reboot of Hinge. The whole story is very interconnected. I feel like I should throw out my questions. We should just do an episode of Call Her Daddy or something like that. That sounds very complicated. Yeah, it’s been a ride. An incredible ride, and very intertwined with Hinge. But back to your question, I think that we can overweight our own personal experience a bit, especially as the CEO of the company. What I found over time is that people have a wide array of very diverse experiences, and to some extent, I think it actually helps that I’m not in there overweighting my own niche feature requests that would matter to me but not to the whole population. So the app has evolved. It’s more about helping others than it is about helping myself, which was probably the original idea of Hinge. How do you think about the connection between what the data is telling you, the data about what Gen Z daters are doing versus millennial daters, which is the cohort you started with, versus the very emotional experiences people have on this platform, which are out of your control? Eventually, you’ve got to take the meat sack to the bar and look at the other person and not fuck it up, right? Hinge can’t solve that problem, but that’s the heart of the whole enterprise. How do you connect those two in your brain? This is a very complex, nuanced industry. I think sometimes people look at their Hinge feed and they’re like, “Why doesn’t this understand my taste as well as my TikTok feed does?” People don’t quite understand that people aren’t products; they’re not infinite copies of everyone.They don’t always behave the same. Your videos on TikTok don’t have to like you back. There’s just a lot of nuance to getting this right. And you’re right. A fair amount of this comes down to the people on the platform. So what we’re trying to do is to [not only] build a great product but also an environment and a community where people are encouraged to be intentional and authentic, and attract users who are looking to find their person. So that’s definitely the art and the nuance of trying to build a dating app like ours. One of my big criticisms of social media apps right now in 2025 is they’ve all become marketing platforms in some way. At the end of the rainbow, Mr. Beast is trying to sell you an energy bar. That’s what they’re for. And smaller creators are trying to get their first-brand deals or whatever. But there’s a real organization around just marketing. And the platforms try to encourage people to create content for a whole number of reasons, but their reason for being is advertising spend, and then a lot of the content creation on the platform happens for marketing purposes. You can just see how it goes. Hinge and other dating apps are different. You’re trying to incentivize content creation. You’re trying to get people to talk about themselves, to talk to each other. The goal is to market yourself. How do you divorce that from the actual thing you’re trying to do, which is to have people fall in love and get into stable relationships? Well, it’s very much about what you’re optimizing for. And you’re right; social media is ultimately optimizing for engagement, retention, and time in app. That is the lifeblood of any of these companies. How long can they keep you sucked in? That is their objective, and so everything is built around that. And we’ve seen what the consequences of that are. They’re pretty dire. I think Hinge is almost the polar opposite of that. We’re trying to get you to spend less time on your phone and more time out in real life on dates. It’s interesting. When I started Hinge back in 2011, as venture capitalists looked at our business they asked those questions around engagement and retention. They were looking at social media, and they’re like, “What’s your daily over monthly? How much time are people spending in the app? How many sessions per day?” We were optimizing for those things, because that’s what VCs were asking about. That’s how we were raising money. Then Hinge did a pretty big pivot in 2015, when I let go of half the company and we rebooted from scratch, because we felt as if we’d really lost our way. We’d become more of a piece of entertainment that was just about getting people more matches and more activity, and getting them back every day. We’d lost sight of what we were trying to do, which was to have people come to us to find a relationship. We weren’t really optimized around that anymore. When we did that pivot in 2015, the biggest change we made was to stop focusing on the competition. We started focusing on the customer, and we made our North Star metric actual great dates. We introduced the “We Met” survey, where we asked people we suspected had gone on a date if they did in fact go on that date and whether it was good. Everything became oriented toward optimizing for that. That ended up creating a very, very different experience. That actually became the primary differentiator of Hinge. A lot of the other apps in the industry were based on engagement and retention and just getting people back; they were more like entertainment platforms. Hinge became a utility. We started growing through word of mouth, and today we’re the fastest-growing, and in fact the only growing, major dating app. We grew 40 percent last year, while other dating apps are shrinking, because we built a very sustainable business model that delivers on value. The lifeblood of our company is getting more users out on dates, so they tell their friends and then their friends come and join Hinge. The interesting thing about that business model is it’s in the tagline of the company. I always laugh when you all put out a press release, because it says, “Hinge, the app designed to be deleted,” and then a little trademark logo follows every time it’s mentioned, which is just very funny. I appreciate that you have to do it, but it just makes me laugh every time. That means you’re trying to graduate users. You’re a utility, you pay until you’re done, and then you’re out. Yeah, precisely. It means you constantly have to find new users. You basically have a different churn problem. How do you think about that life cycle? We think about it in terms of good churn. We want people turning off the app for the right reason. We don’t want people turning off the app because they gave up too early or because they don’t like Hinge. We want people turning off the app because they found someone, ideally on Hinge. What does it mean to find somebody on Hinge? Like you’re married? You’ve gone on three dates? It’s different for different people. When we did the reboot, our core market was definitely 25- to 35-year-olds, and very much people who were, I would say, looking to find their person and get off the app. Now our fastest-growing segment has been 18- to 25-year-olds, and they’re at a different phase in their lives. It was pretty interesting. When we saw that segment starting to grow, it came as almost a surprise to us. I think what attracted these younger daters wasn’t so much a focus on finding a long-term relationship, or a marriage partner today; it was very much about the authenticity and vulnerability and intimacy they found on Hinge, and a moving away from platforms that felt very gamified and flat to something that felt very human and intentional and authentic. So we think about our daters as having a journey mindset. They’re headed in a direction, they’re on a journey of self-exploration. They don’t want to waste their time on bad dates, but they aren’t necessarily looking for their marriage partner today, and that’s totally fine. We’re just looking to help people get off the app and out on great dates, and form intimate connections in real life. But there’s a difference between getting off the app and going on great dates, and then deleting the entire thing, right? Forever, yes. There’s one exit ramp that is very different from another exit ramp. Not to keep comparing it to social media, but again, I feel as if I’m just viewing this from the outside, so it’s all metaphors for me. Mark Zuckerberg is terrified that young audiences will just abandon his core app, or whatever the core social media dynamic is at the time. This is why he bought Instagram. You can read his emails over the course of these trials. He’s like, “There’s another mechanic. I need to buy it before they overtake us.” Zuckerberg keeps going down the line, whether that’s Stories or Reels or whatever the next thing is. You have the same problem, only you don’t get to keep the old users on the old mechanic. You don’t get to run Facebook and buy Instagram. How do you think about reinventing the app for that new, younger cohort that has different dynamics on the internet? We always stay in tune with where the culture’s going. I think it’s just imperative, because, you’re right, we can’t rely on only a legacy user base. So we have to stay on top of culture and where it’s going, and then continually evolve the app accordingly. Right now, a big focus is on AI, and how we can increase the effectiveness of the app in a couple of different dimensions. We’re actually finding, for example, the extent to which coaching has become really, really important right now. Especially during the pandemic, we saw social skills atrophy. People felt less comfortable meeting up with others in real life and interacting. So we’re helping people create their profiles, write their prompts, things like that. Another big thing that came out during the pandemic was more of a focus on voice, and adding voice prompts, which I think is, again, an example of our moving where the culture goes. So we’re always making these kinds of tweaks to continually keep the app fresh. Do you feel the same existential pressure? There’s this idea that some cohort of people will delete the app — the old millennials will be married or tired or whatever it is they’re going to do, and you’ve got to go get a bunch of new Gen Z users or Gen Alpha users, which is frankly terrifying. How do you think about, “Okay, we’ve got to break the old model, because it’s existential for us if we don’t capture the younger user,” or is it more of a gradation? If you look at the relatively brief history of this industry starting in the ‘90s, there’s only been one major disruption moment, which was around 2012. So you had the birth of the industry in the late ‘90s, where you had Match and eHarmony come on the scene, and then they dominated from 1996 to about 2014. It was actually a much smaller niche industry at the time. The users were older, people who felt as if they’d really struggled to find someone in real life. Then you had the mobile dating apps come on because of a few different technologies that started to come online all together — one was mobile, one was the cultural change of everyone having a social media account. Another was data-processing power and moving away from the world of searching for people to a world of a feed of relevant people, one after another. That created a pretty big paradigm shift, where suddenly technology enabled an entirely new type of experience that it was hard for the old incumbents to mirror. They tried to pivot to mobile, but they couldn’t unseat themselves from their way of thinking about the world. It resembles a very classic disruption problem. I think the next opportunity for that kind of disruption is going to be a big technology shift. We haven’t seen that up until very recently. Like with VR, AR, and other technologies like that, I just don’t see those working until they’re deeply adopted by 70 percent to 80 percent of the population, and that’s when I think it will really become something that people start using for dating. AI I think is a very different story, and it’s unclear at this point whether it becomes a disruptive force for the current players or whether it becomes more of an evolution. Obviously, Hinge has a tremendous amount of data we can use to train AI models. We’re seeing huge gains in our ability to match people up more thoughtfully given the tools, and at the same time we could introduce very new paradigms for dating. I want to talk about AI with you, but you mentioned Match, so I think this is a good time to get to the Decoder questions. You’re part of Match Group. You sold to Match Group, and now Match Group owns all of the dating apps minus one, which is a little contentious. It doesn’t own Bumble. There’s a lawsuit. We can set that aside. What’s it like being part of Match Group? When you sold your company, what was that decision like for you? Honestly, at the time we were in a tough position as a company. I’d done the reboot, and we were about a year into that reboot experience, and we had not really cracked the code yet. There were green shoots there that made me believe and made, I would say, the trained eye believe that there was really something there. But VCs just saw that we were popular, and then we tore down our business, and we restarted, and we started to rebuild again. There wasn’t a lot of juice there. So we went with a strategy of recognizing the value of what we were seeing, including massive increases in effectiveness, women coming to the platform in a much higher proportion than on other dating apps. So that was very interesting to Match. And so we received a strategic investment from the company in 2017, and that gave it a path to buy the rest of the company, which it did at the end of 2018. What’s that structure like inside of Match Group now? It’s evolving. There’s a brand-new CEO, Spencer Rascoff, who just started, and I think he’s taking a fresh look at some of that. But up until recently, and still today, the company operates pretty independently. We’re in New York. We pretty much have our own space. We have our own product teams, our own engineering teams, our own marketing teams that operate very independently. We share learnings across the platform. We use shared services like accounting and legal and things like that. But for the most part, the company has its own independent culture, its own independent mission, product road maps, marketing strategies, all of that. You said you shared some central services, like accounting and finance. Is there any product or data that you’re sharing? We certainly share learnings. Especially on things that we don’t really want to compete on, such as safety or monetization or things like that. So there’s certainly that, and there’s sharing for safety purposes. Those are the main ways we share. So if you’re a young and carefree single on Tinder, and you graduate to Hinge, you don’t get to just bring your data along for the ride? [Laughs] No. Again, I’m just looking from the outside. Tinder is interesting. The CEO of Tinder just stepped down. Your new CEO at Match, Spencer, stepped in to run Tinder for a minute. In any normal circumstance, you would be on the attack. If Tinder wasn’t part of the same company as you, this would be a moment to say, “Okay, there’s some strategic weakness over there. We’re going to go get them. We’re going to put the screws on.” Are you allowed to do that inside Match Group? So first of all, I’ll just say that we don’t really think too much about Tinder as Hinge’s competition. We think about Tinder in a very different psychographic mindset. You come to Hinge because you want to really take your time, be intentional, be thoughtful, find your person. Tinder has a much more casual, younger, “anything can happen” mentality. And so that was a very intentional portfolio strategy decision that Match made back when it acquired us. So no, we don’t think about it like that. That’s why I asked about the data and the lifecycle question. There’s a time in your life where you might use Tinder, there’s a time in your life where you might use Hinge. It seems from the overall umbrella company perspective, you want to move that user around your family of apps, but it doesn’t seem as if that’s actually happening at the top level. Yes. From the outside that would make sense. It’s a bit nuanced, because there are very different brand reputations. We like to think of Hinge pretty independently, and I think so do our users. So there’s no pop-up on Tinder that’s like, “Maybe, it’s time to cool it and download Hinge”? There’s not. [Laughs] Okay, feature request for you. What’s your org chart like? How is Hinge structured? That’s also been evolving over time, and we’re still a relatively small company. We have about 350 employees. If I think about the evolution of Hinge growing from one person to the first 100 to 150 people, originally, it was very centrally run. There was tight coordination. A lot of direction came directly from me and my executive team. Then as we started to grow beyond 100 people, I would say a lot of the technology was relatively stable. Like with social, mobile, big data, the question became, “How do we keep optimizing and iterating around this?” We became a pretty decentralized organization, where we had principles around pushing decision-making down to the lowest levels possible, keeping it really on the front lines. We had pretty independent cross-functional product teams that would work on their individual little missions or surfaces. We oscillated back and forth between that. People felt they had a lot of autonomy. That was the main ethos of the company. And then I think with AI over the last couple of years, we felt like, “Whoa, we really need to make a pretty big shift.” Like I said, the risk of disruption is high, with very big opportunities to shift the product experience in a new direction. It now requires pulling decision-making back in toward the center a bit, and giving a much clearer strategic direction to the team, so that we’re all working in concert toward one thing. Because the whole app really has to move together. Different parts of the app have to talk to each other in ways that when we weren’t going through much change, wasn’t as essential. That said, we still have very highly cross-functional product teams where product managers sit with a dedicated designer, researcher, data scientist, and tech lead to attack very mission-oriented problems. You mentioned “surfaces” and “missions.” Are those expressed as just the tabs at the bottom of the app? Is that how they’re broken down, or are they actual user journey missions? That’s what I mean — surfaces versus missions. I think we’ve gone in different directions. There’s never really a clear line of one versus the other. Do you own the Discover tab, where users just discover new people, or is your job to help people find the right person? In that case, you have to think more cohesively about operating across different surfaces or parts of the app. Now we think about our teams operating less as individual surface units and more as part of a cohesive dating-outcomes team, where people feel a bit more flexible moving around to different surfaces. How do you think about assigning product managers to those teams? Because PMs, at least in my experience, are like, “I own this square, and I will mess with this square to make this number go up as much as I can.” But “I can mess with all the squares” is really hard, right? Yes, that’s why we have strong directors at the VP level who oversee an overall mission the way that a head of dating outcomes or a head of growth, who’s coordinating a set of product managers, would. And again, we ask our PMs. Their primary identity is as a dating outcomes PM, not as a discover PM, or a profile PM, or something like that. And while day to day most of their work may focus on the profile and identity work, they see themselves as very much operating as part of this team. That feels like something you evolved to. You’re a relatively young founder. I think you founded the company right out of Harvard Business School. How has your decision-making framework evolved? How do you make decisions? That’s also hugely evolved. Everything I’ve learned, I’ve learned through doing it all the wrong ways first and then eventually getting to the right way. When you’re a founder and you have a small team of 10, 20, or 30 people, you’re just making decisions by the seat of your pants. What feels good? What feels right? You’re just using your own gut. As we started to get toward 100 people or so, what I noticed was I would be making different decisions on different days that weren’t always consistent. They were based on my mood that day or whatever data was in front of me or what I had last read or whatever. I was just finding I was getting pretty inconsistent. So what I started trying to do was to write down my whole management algorithm. I started putting it in a Google Doc, like “Here’s how I make decisions, here’s what I believe is true.” I started publishing that to the whole company, so everyone could just read it. We would be just very transparent about how we made decisions. It was around the time that I think I read Ray Dalio’s book Principles, and got super dialed in on how we make decisions. What are our principles, and what do we believe is true? Then I opened it up so everyone could comment on it. We would have long debates in the comment margins of a Google Doc to consider everything from our product-strategy principles to whether Hinge should have a dress code. Literally anything. It was all just there so that everyone could debate it. We had hundreds of principles, and then as the company got even bigger and we got to 300 or 400 people, it was very hard. One, you just can’t have these endless debates in Google Docs anymore. Also, the principles started to stabilize. There wasn’t as much debate and churn anymore, and then it actually became an exercise in distilling down the most essential things to communicate about our culture. I worked a couple of years ago to write an internal book called How We Do Things, which distilled it all down to four or five principles. For example, what are the most fundamental things to understand about how we make decisions here? And then individual teams and individual projects would then write their own principles that were more specific to what they were doing at any given time. One of our meta principles now is “decide with principles,” meaning that we don’t want decisions getting made based on some random person’s opinion that if tomorrow this person leaves the company and we hire someone else, they’re going to come in with a completely different set of ideas about how to do something. We really try to define our principles first, agree on those principles, and then see how our work maps to them. I’m happy to talk about what the other three principles are if you want, but that’s the framework we use to make decisions now. Yeah, talk about them a little bit. There’s a beautiful website, we’ll link to it. It has storytelling, it’s well done. But tell people what the other three principles are. So the next one is “love the problem.” What I would notice is we would get an inclination around a user problem, which maybe was not even validated 100 percent. Then we’d start getting feature ideas, and we’d get very attached to a feature, and sometimes the feature would drift and not even be solving the original problem. What I found was, if you want to build breakthrough innovative product features and products, you have to spend extra time with the problem to really understand the why behind the why behind the why of of it. You need to ask, “What’s really going on here? Can we really get deep into our users, into the data, into our users’ experiences?” You have to go to that level to get insight that just isn’t available on the surface, and then stay really committed to that problem. And that’s what, again, allows for innovation. I think for a lot of Silicon Valley, the strategy is just to throw feature ideas against a wall and see what sticks: “Let’s see if this works. Oh, it doesn’t work, throw that out, let’s try something else.” When you have a lot of deep conviction around a user problem, and you really know you want to solve it, then you have the resilience to try and try again to solve that problem, even if your first or second iteration doesn’t make it. So one of the most foundational of our principles is, “love the problem.” Fall in love with the problem, don’t fall in love with the solution, as you must be willing to give up the solution at any given time if it’s not solving the core problem that you’re trying to solve. So that is “love the problem.” Next is “keep it simple,” meaning that I think the best solutions are always the most elegant solutions. Overall, we want to keep the product very simplified and minimal. Our colors are black and white. If you look at the Hinge product today, it’s very clean, it’s very simple. We’re always stripping away features that don’t make sense and just recognizing that there’s complexity. There’s a cost to complexity every time you add a feature. So even if you add a feature, if it’s only marginally beneficial, the cost of the complexity and maintaining that feature versus the marginal benefit it adds will end up gunking up the app over time and slowing you down over time. That’s a hard conversation to have with product managers, because they’ll work for months on a feature and they’ll ship it and say, “Yeah, it didn’t harm the user base, we like it, and it even moved this metric over here by 2 percent.” And you’re like, “Well, the cost of complexity is high, and so we need to focus on things that are actually going to have a major impact.” Are you all the way two features out for every feature in? Do you think about it that way? I know some founders do. I haven’t heard that before. I don’t necessarily think that way. But I do believe in constantly reevaluating what’s in the app, asking what needs to stay, and having a high bar for building a new feature. So does it actually accomplish what we need it to accomplish, and is the complexity worth the cost? So that’s the third one now. The fourth, the last one, is “tend to trust.” I just find that trust is the lifeblood of an organization. You have to do a lot of work to proactively cultivate and tend to trust by creating strong interpersonal relationships, by creating lots of opportunities for transparency at the organization. We have always been very, very transparent about where the organization is headed. So much so that we had to make all Hinge employees Match Group insiders so they couldn’t trade Match Group stock except during trading windows, because we would be so transparent about where we were, what our financial position was. Everyone should know that all the way down to any position at the company. I think the trust that you create both interpersonally and from the leadership on down to the rest of the organization is absolutely essential. It just saves you a lot of headaches when it comes to internal politics and all those types of things. Let’s put this into practice. You obviously made a big decision to refocus on AI. How did that come about? Did you wake up one day and say, “Oh boy, it’s happening”? Was it that Match Group put out a press release with OpenAI saying, “We’re going to work together”? Did you read that and say, “I got to figure this out”? How did this come about? Certainly the release of whatever version of ChatGPT that sent shockwaves through the world was a pretty big wake-up call. Obviously, we’d already been using machine learning and things like that in the interest of safety, and in our algorithms, our recommendation algorithms. But I think the shot across the bow that came from the release of ChatGPT [with GPT-3.5] was what really woke us up to the potential capabilities here and to realizing that this could be a major disruptive force in a way that we hadn’t really seen since we started Hinge. It took a bit for us to get our strategy clear about what our thesis was on how this was going to affect matching and dating in the future. It wasn’t immediately apparent, but I think we have a pretty clear thesis now, and we’ve started to organize the company around that thesis. What’s the thesis? That there’s two main vectors that AI is going to impact: dating and matchmaking. I think the big story is AI is going to move Hinge much closer to the experience of working with a personalized matchmaking service, and away from the experience of feeling that you are joining a social platform on your own as you try to find your person. So what does that mean? Two big pieces. One is personalized matching, and the other is effective coaching. On the personalized matching front, we should be able to move much further beyond the world we are in today, which is our users speaking to us in essentially Morse code as they try to communicate to us what they like and what they don’t like. The idea is that they would be able to speak much more directly to us with “here’s what I’m looking for, here are my values, here’s my personality, here are my interests.” It means Hinge being able to listen to them and hear their preferences, and even integrate things like relationship science into the app to better understand what types of people are compatible and what types of people are not long-term compatible, and introduce them to a much more curated, higher-quality, less-quantity list of people, where they have much more trust that if you’re introducing them to this person, this is probably someone they want to go out with. We’ve already seen big gains, by the way, just by using the power of LLMs to drive more of our recommendation systems using the data we already have. But we released a new algorithm a couple of months ago that increased matches and dates by like 15 percent, and that’s just using the same data. But now we can start to use much more of that unstructured, nuanced data, with people talking to us in their own voice about who they are and what they want, which we can use very effectively. So that’s the whole personalized matching front. Then there’s the effective coaching front. A lot of our users struggle to get out on that first date, and they often don’t know why. I have friends who are incredible people, and they’ll ask me to take a look at their Hinge profile. I’m flabbergasted that this is their attempt at putting themselves out there. So we’re starting with pretty basic things. Hinge has these prompts, which are short questions designed to get you into a conversation, and you put them on your profile. A lot of people write great responses to prompts, but a lot of people write not-so-great responses, often just one-word answers that just don’t work. We found it’s just incredibly effective to have trained an AI model on good-prompt responses and give people feedback. And it’s mostly like, “Can you say more about that?” [Laughs] Don’t just put “no.” Yeah, and to be a little bit more specific and tell a little bit of the story. Good answers invite another question back, or get a conversation going. So we can give people those nudges so they write good prompts, so that they choose good photos. We have a team called Hinge Labs, which is always looking at why some people succeed, and why some people don’t on the app. Some of it is, again, simply building product features that help solve those problems, but another part of it is just giving guidance and notes about how they can be using the product better. We have traditionally published those in date reports, and we publish them in the press and we place them in the help center. But for the most part people just don’t read them. But the idea that we can take this body of knowledge we have about how to succeed on Hinge, and then look at how our users are using Hinge, and then deliver the right piece of advice at the right time to the right user, I think is going to be pretty transformative for a lot of people. There’s a pretty fine line between that and what I see lots of people already doing all day long, which is just talking to ChatGPT, just hanging out. We had Eugenia Kuyda, the CEO of Replika, on the show, and she said, essentially, “My plan is people are going to date AI bots that will coach them up into being fully formed people, then we’ll release them into the dating pool, and they will have confidence and self-assuredness.” Again, there’s a fine line between prompting someone and coaching them inside Hinge, and we’re coaching them in a different way within a more self-contained ecosystem. How do you think about that? Would you launch a full-on virtual girlfriend inside Hinge? Certainly not. I have lots of thoughts about this. I think there’s actually quite a clear line between providing a tool that helps people do something or get better at something, and the line where it becomes this thing that is trying to become your friend, trying to mimic emotions, and trying to create an emotional connection with you. That I think is really playing with fire. I think we are already in a crisis of loneliness, and a loneliness epidemic. It’s a complex issue, and it’s baked into our culture, and it goes back to before the internet. But just since 2000, over the past 20 years, the amount of time that people spend together in real life with their friends has dropped by 70 percent for young people. And it’s been almost completely displaced by the time spent staring at screens. As a result, we’ve seen massive increases in mental health issues, and people’s loneliness, anxiety, and depression. I think Mark Zuckerberg was just quoted about this, that most people don’t have enough friends. But he said we’re going to give them AI chatbots. That he believes that AI chatbots can become your friends. I think that’s honestly an extraordinarily reductive view of what a friendship is, that it’s someone there to say all the right things to you at the right moment The most rewarding parts of being in a friendship are being able to be there for someone else, to risk and be vulnerable, to share experiences with other conscious entities. So I think that while it will feel good in the moment, like junk food basically, to have an experience with someone who says all the right things and is available at the right time, it will ultimately, just like junk food, make people feel less healthy and mo re drained over time. It will displace the human relationships that people should be cultivating out in the real world. How do you compete with that? That is the other thing that is happening. It is happening. Whether it’s good or bad. Hinge is offering a harder path. So you say, “We’ve got to get people out on dates.” I honestly wonder about that, based on the younger folks I know who sometimes say, “I just don’t want to leave the house. I would rather just talk to this computer. I have too much social pressure just leaving the house in this way.” That’s what Hinge is promising to do. How do you compete with that? Do you take it head on? Are you marketing that directly? I’m starting to think very much about taking it head on. We want to continue at Hinge to champion human relationships, real human-to-human-in-real-life relationships, because I think they are an essential part of the human experience, and they’re essential to our mental health. It’s not just because I run a dating app and, obviously, it’s important that people continue to meet. It really is a deep, personal mission of mine, and I think it’s absolutely critical that someone is out there championing this. Because it’s always easier to race to the bottom of the brain stem and offer people junk products that maybe sell in the moment but leave them worse off. That’s the entire model that we’ve seen from what happened with social media. I think AI chatbots could frankly be much more dangerous in that respect. So what we can do is to become more and more effective and support people more and more, and make it as easy as possible to do the harder and riskier thing, which is to go out and form real relationships with real people. They can let you down and might not always be there for you, but it is ultimately a much more nourishing and enriching experience for people. We can also champion and raise awareness as much as we can. That’s another reason why I’m here today talking with you, because I think it’s important to put out the counter perspective, that we don’t just reflexively believe that AI chatbots can be your friend, without thinking too deeply about what that really implies and what that really means. We keep going back to junk food, but people had to start waking up to the fact that this was harmful. We had to do a lot of campaigns to educate people that drinking Coca-Cola and eating fast food was detrimental to their health over the long term. And then as people became more aware of that, a whole personal wellness industry started to grow, and now that’s a huge industry, and people spend a lot of time focusing on their diet and nutrition and mental health, and all these other things. I think similarly, social wellness needs to become a category like that. It’s thinking about not just how do I get this junk social experience of social media where I get fed outraged news and celebrity gossip and all that stuff, but how do I start building a sense of social wellness, where I can create an enriching, intimate connection with important people in my life. The connection between the wellness industry and the rise of social media is a whole other podcast, and maybe a PhD thesis, too. There’s a whole lot there to unpack. I take your point though, that maybe using our phones in healthier ways is the future. It will make us better, and that will be a reaction to the negativity we see from phones today. Literally as we speak, I’m sure Elon Musk and Donald Trump are continuing to tweet at each other in an unhealthy way for maybe the future of the entire planet. But you’ve got to use AI today. You have prompt feedback running in the app today. You’re helping people pick better photos. The flip side of that is that they might just use AI to generate the content. Can you detect it if your prompt feedback says, “Hey, that’s not a good answer,” and someone runs away to Gemini or ChatGPT and comes up with a better answer that doesn’t actually reflect them? I think about this like the extreme photo filters, which used to be popular on Instagram back in the day. Ultimately, you are going to have to go meet up with this person on a real date, and so you want to come across as best as you can, because, obviously, you’re not going to bring ChatGPT on your date with you. I’m worried about this. I want to say that I’m worried about this. So it’s not a winning strategy. That said, do people ask for advice and little tweaks? They already do it today. They ask their friends, “How should I respond to this text message?” So in some sense, I don’t see it that differently, because you will have to meet up with this person eventually and show up as the real you. Would you add that feedback inside Hinge? Hinge obviously has messaging features. Are you going to add a little coach into the messaging feature to say, “Hey, don’t be a dick”? That already exists. It’s called “Are You Sure?” That’s AI-driven to make sure people don’t send inappropriate messages. But yeah, again, the right nudge at the right time, because I think if we build the right tools within Hinge that are appropriate for dating, people will then use it and be less likely to run out to ChatGPT and use [the feedback] in ways that are probably less appropriate. Nudging people to say, “Hey, you guys have been chatting for a bit. Did you know that most people, after they exchange this many messages, usually just go on and move to a date?” Or, “Hey, it seems like the conversation has died. Here’s something interesting that you may not have noticed on their profile that you can ask about.” Little things like that, certainly. One of the interesting dynamics here is you’ll add more and more AI to the digital experience people have with each other to make them perform better or act better or be more interesting, whatever it is. And then they’ll go on a date, and then they might leave your platform. They might switch to iMessage or call each other on the phone. I don’t think Gen Z is calling each other. They’ll do something else. They’ll go on Discord. How do you bring that experience along for the ride to say, “We’re going to continue to stay here and help mediate and coach you through this relationship”? We’re not there yet. We still have a lot of work to do just to get people out on the first date. And at the same time, I do think there’s actually a lot of opportunity to help coach people through that experience. How to show up on a first date. What to talk about on a first date. How to build intimacy over time, how to ask about the right things to determine compatibility. So I think there are definitely opportunities for that. It’s not on the 2025 road map, but it’s certainly something I’m thinking about. Do you worry that people are going to just upload full AI avatars on Hinge and catfish each other to death? We have a very robust trust and safety team that is thinking two to three steps ahead about how to mitigate things like that. I have spent too much time talking about watermarks in AI and SynthID, and there’s lots of episodes of the show that are deep in the AI watermarks game, and it has effectively come to nothing so far. There’s just a lot of problems there. Are you able to say, “Okay, we can detect a full AI photo here”? There’s so many signals when it comes to creating a dating profile from the phone number you use and the email you use and your IP address, all those things like that, that we have a very multifaceted way of determining the authenticity of profiles. I’ll say that. Running these models is costly. There’s lots and lots of different kinds of models you can run at different costs. Are you using lots of models? Are you sending everything to GPT-4? How does this work for you? We use different models for different things. Sometimes we build them completely internally. As you said, it’s public that we have a relationship with OpenAI. So we use different things and are always balancing cost and performance against our ability to build in-house versus not. Do you see that trend shifting over time? I’m very curious about what the frontier models can do versus what the cheaper, more efficient models can do. Have you seen that shift over time as you’ve started to deploy these tools? For one, we’ve seen the cost of the frontier models just decline precipitously, which is pretty interesting to watch. But I’ll say that there are models, even the prompt feedback model, that are very, very specific and discrete, and that we can mostly build internally to understand. Do you run that in your cloud and your data center? Or are you running that on people’s phones? I don’t actually know. I think that’s in the cloud. I’m almost positive that one is in the cloud. The reason I’m asking is that to do any of this well, you need more and more data from people, and you’re asking them to generate more and more data. For instance, “That’s not a good answer; tell me more about yourself,” is more data and it’s data that you’re now storing. In particular, it’s data about gender, sexuality, and dating preferences — that’s stuff the government suddenly has a very unusual and somewhat threatening interest in. Are you worried about that? That the Trump administration or some future administration would show up and say, “Tell me all of the transgender people on your platform”? Obviously, we have very, very sensitive data that we have very, very clear protections around. And we haven’t seen anything like that. So you haven’t had any of those incoming requests yet? No. The Trump administration has also said it’s going to start scanning social media profiles for references to Palestine, and for comments about Trump himself. When you talk about matching people and values, those things come up. Has there been any request for Hinge profiles from the Department of Homeland Security or ICE or any of these other parts of the Trump administration that are doing this social media scanning? No. The reason I’m asking is the amount of data you might collect is very, very personal. It seems like a rich target. Have you thought about the planning for how big of a target this might become as you prompt people to input more and more data with AI? Certainly. I think we’ll have to handle those things as they come. We’re obviously in a very uncertain time right now, but I will say that we are primarily a platform about creating intimate one-to-one connections where people should be able to express themselves in the way they see fit, and describe themselves and their own sexuality and their own gender in the way they need to do. That will inevitably touch on people’s very private lives. I view that as absolutely sacred and fundamental to our mission, and people feeling safe to express themselves is absolutely critical. So those would be our very highest priorities, and I imagine not top priority for social media, where people are blasting posts to thousands, or millions, of people. Our platform is not about one-to-many posting and conversation. It’s about intimate one-to-one connection and one-to-one conversations. I think I would warn you that having a data pool of that kind might make you a target. I’m curious how that plays out over time, particularly in this administration. There’s some platform dynamics here as well, like iOS and Android exist. They are platforms. They’re also themselves rich targets for the government. Overall, there’s a push for the platforms to do age verification themselves. There’s laws now in certain states, and in other countries, that the Apples and the Googles of the world have pushed back against in various ways. Do you think they need to do it? Do you think that it’s at the iOS and Android level that you need to do the age verification? Because this is a core component of bringing people onto Hinge. It’s not for children. It’s certainly not. We’re 18-plus and we have our own age verification methods. But yeah, we have been pushing for these platforms to do age verification themselves because they have even more robust ways to do it. The arguments in response — when you listen to Apple and Google push back against these laws — is that it would be too hard. It would create a censorship regime, that the app vendors need to be liable for this. Have you seen any movement in that dynamic? I think at the highest level, this is one of the big dynamics of how we might regulate platforms in the future. I am staying much closer to product development and where we’re going with AI right now than I am to that. Your monetization method is obviously a premium version of Hinge. I think one tier is $55 a month. There’s another tier that’s $45 a month. The big news in the platform world is that Apple is no longer allowed to prevent alternative payment systems. Match Group, in particular, has been leading this fight. It’s in all the press releases. Has that changed the dynamics of Hinge for you? I don’t know if it changes the dynamics, but it’s certainly going to give us more flexibility in giving users options to be able to pay in different ways. I think that’s good for everybody for sure. Have you launched an alternative payment service yet? We have not. Would you like to? Yes. How soon? Certainly by the end of the year. Is that going to be a Match Group payment service or a Hinge payment service? How do you think about that? These are things that we’re figuring out, but most likely Hinge. That would return somewhere on the order of 15 percent to 30 percent depending on how the billing works for you at your scale and recurring subscriptions and all that. Is that just going to be pure margin? You’re just going to get the money back? Well, I think it changes the equation on many fronts. It allows us to invest more in the company. It changes how we would price, so no, I think it could result in lower prices. It could result in more investment in the company, or it could result in more margin. It’s probably some combination of all three of those. Match Group has been doing this fight for a long time, and you’re already describing how you might change pricing or the lifetime value of customers. Fortnite maker Epic Games fought this fight for five years. At the very end, the judge says, “I’m very mad at you, Apple. You can’t do this anymore.” Did you immediately start making plans that day or were you like, “This is going to get appealed, we have to wait”? There’s been back and forth and appeals and stays and things like that. I think just a couple of days ago, the appeal was denied. So I think that made it pretty real. Just to put the decision-making into practice, did you say that day we need an alternative payment system? Certainly the day that the original ruling came out, we started to plan. What does that planning look like? Is it, “I’m going to call Stripe”? Put us in your shoes. That happens. Someone comes to you and you say, “Okay. We need to start to plan.” Walk us through that moment. Just like anything else at Hinge, I think that we stay grounded in our principles. We look at the big picture. We look at the teams and the road maps and the things they’re focused on right now, and we think, “Does this new information change anything? And as we look at our growth team, does it make sense to build the next monetization or expansion feature? Does it make sense to pivot resources over to this thing?” And given, as you said, the 15 percent to 30 percent gain that’s on the table, it’s a pretty high priority. There’s an ecosystem of companies that might be building this stuff more centrally, that might be charging different rates. I’m excited about that. It’s wonky and boring. There’s a reason we’re ending the episode on payment systems. A whole new industry I think will emerge. Well maybe not an industry, but certainly a suite of services will emerge around this to allow people to manage subscription payments, cancellations. It’s certainly nuanced. But at the end of that, what you want is rates to come down. Where do you think the rates should be? I know no one has ever thought they should be at 15 percent or 30 percent. Where do you think they should be with a little more market competition? When you stack the credit card payment processing fees on top of the fees around customer service and all the nuance of managing those, I do think it comes down to the 5 percent to 10 percent range. When you think about recovering that up to 20 percent, are you thinking, “Okay, I can use this to lower prices and grow,” or is it that you have to build many, many more AI features to compete against the coming onslaught of AI chatbots? [Laughs] I think we’re very, very focused on innovating for the future. Like I said, it changes the equation, so it’s on all three fronts. It’s lower prices, it’s higher margin, and it’s more investment in the company. But it certainly gives us major opportunities to invest in the core product experience at a time when there’s massive disruption. So it’s a particularly critical time to be doing that. There’s a lot of talk about platform shifts. You’ve talked about platform shifts here. People might be using Hinge differently, because they have AI tools or because the AI tools are helping them find one another more efficiently, or better. A lot of the platform shift I hear about is, “Oh, we’re going to have new devices. We’re going to have new form factors. People are just going to talk to ChatGPT in the bar.” Maybe we’ll just have agents that represent us, and they’ll go on dates for a while, and come back and say, “You should go on this date with this other person we found on Hinge,” because the agents have fallen in love, and now you just have to not screw it up. That takes the screen away. That takes your surfaces and your missions and puts them in a totally different place. How are you thinking about that level of shift? Is it even on your radar? Yeah, I’m thinking about it right now. I think we overuse the form factor of our mobile devices right now for all kinds of things that it doesn’t need to be used for. I think a lot of those will be siphoned off into some other form factor. I especially think audio and voice is going to be a very big piece of it. But I don’t think that means that the form factor completely goes away. There are things that you need visual cues and references for where a screen is still going to be the dominant form factor. At least a piece of the dating equation is going to be that, for sure. Do you think we’ll get to a place where people’s agents are just dating each other and then reporting back? No, I don’t really think so. I think there are much better– Isn’t that what’s already happening in the matchmaking algorithm, in a very reductive way? Isn’t that what’s going on? I think in a very abstractive, reductive way, you could say that. But that’s not really what’s happening. We are not simulating dates. I think it’s a very expensive and inefficient way to do something that is actually much more straightforward. There’s just a part of me that says you’re going to have some competitor that attempts this, and we will all have to contend with it. I just think that’s a bit of a red herring for trying to map someone’s psyche and guess how they’re going to act. That adds a lot of complexity when actually you can just talk to people very directly about who they are and what they’re looking for and what matters to them, and compare that against someone else and what they describe, and actually make a lot of good connections and [get a] clear understanding in figuring out who should match with whom. Justin, this has been great. Tell people what’s next for Hinge. What should they be looking for? It really is the evolution of the product. I think that the shift to AI is going to be bigger than the shift to mobile for the industry. If you think about the big picture of what mobile did, it just made the process more approachable, faster, more fun, easier. But it was still the same fundamental experience of just cruising for people and trying to find someone based on very limited information, matching with them, trying to figure it out, going on a date, realizing this is not your person, trying to find the next date. We’re moving much closer to a world of really deep understanding of compatibility. Being able to zero in on the right person very quickly. It’s going to be a very transformative experience that I think is going to very much change people’s understanding and perception of the industry. So I’m really looking forward to the next couple of years, because I think that we will see more change than we’ve ever seen in the industry before. We’ll have to have you back to check in on how it’s going. Thanks so much for coming on Decoder. Great. Thank you. Questions or comments about this episode? Hit us up at decoder@theverge.com.

Title: Move over, Magnificent 7: Goldman Sachs proposes the ‘Prom 10,’ China’s top stocks including Tencent, Alibaba and BYD

Full Content:
Cecilia Hult is an editorial intern based in Hong Kong. Investors are flocking to Chinese markets in a search for alternatives to U.S. equities. DeepSeek’s AI breakthrough earlier this year proved that China could compete on the technological frontier. Economists are betting that Beijing might finally unleash more stimulus to revive flagging domestic consumption. And policy volatility in Washington, thanks to U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade war, is pushing investors to start diversifying their portfolios away from the U.S. It’s a big shift from earlier arguments that Chinese companies were “uninvestable” due to concerns about policy uncertainty and China’s sluggish economy. Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng Index is up by over 20% so far this year, even as Trump threatened steep tariffs on imports from China. By comparison, the S&P 500 is up by around 2%. Investors have used the “Magnificent 7”—Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla—as shorthand for the top-performing stocks on U.S. markets. These seven companies both reflect U.S. strength in Big Tech and tap into major trends like AI. But what about China? Investment bank Goldman Sachs, in a report released last week, highlighted 10 stocks that are best poised for growth in the Chinese market. Together, they make up what the bank calls the “Prominent 10”, or “Prom 10” for short. Unlike the Magnificent 7, these stocks cover more than just tech and AI, extending into retail and other consumer services. Together, the stocks amount to $1.6 trillion in market value, according to Goldman Sachs, compared to $19 trillion for the Mag 7. The bank predicts that the Prom 10’s earnings will grow by an average of 13% annually over the next two years. The Prom 10 “collectively embody the theme of AI/Tech development, self-sufficiency, ‘Going Global’, services and new forms of consumption, and China’s improving shareholder returns,” Goldman Sachs wrote in its report. The bank also suggests that its chosen companies have more opportunities to expand and consolidate their positions in the more fragmented Chinese economy. The most valuable company on the Prom 10 is Tencent, one of the world’s largest video game publishers and operator of the ubiquitous WeChat messaging app. Tencent’s superapp is one of a handful of platforms that boasts over a billion users. Valued at around $585 billion, Tencent is Asia’s second-most valuable company, behind chipmaker TSMC. E-commerce giant Alibaba is also on the Prom 10. Shares in the company are up more than 35% so far this year, thanks to optimism around AI. Developers both inside and outside of China are embracing the company’s open-source Qwen model, making Alibaba the AI leader among the country’s big tech companies. Meituan, China’s food delivery giant, is another Prom 10 stock. The company holds a 70% market share in the delivery space, and is expanding to new markets like Hong Kong, Saudi Arabia, and Brazil. Yet the stock has taken a beating in recent weeks due to fierce competition from JD.com, another e-commerce giant. BYD, the world’s largest producer of electric vehicles, and Xiaomi, a major Chinese smartphone brand that’s recently expanded to cars, also hold spots in Goldman Sachs’ “Prom 10.” Chinese EVs are quickly winning over customers both in China and overseas, due to the affordable price points and appealing designs. That’s helped boost the shares of both companies: BYD and Xiaomi are up by around 45% and 60% respectively. Midea Group is one of China’s leading manufacturers of home appliances and another Prom 10 stock. The company debuted on Hong Kong’s stock exchange last year, raising almost $4 billion. Tencent, Alibaba, Meituan, Xiaomi, BYD, and Midea are all on Fortune’s Global 500, which ranks the world’s largest companies by revenue. Rounding out the Prom 10 are NetEase Games, the second-highest grossing gaming company in China; Hengrui, a leading pharmaceutical manufacturer; Trip.com, a travel booking platform; and ANTA, the world’s third-largest sportswear company, behind Nike and Adidas. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change Quote of the Week: “No government has the right to decide on the truth of scientific principles.” — Richard Feynman, The Meaning of It All: Thoughts of a Citizen-Scientist (1998) Number of the Week: 35,000 MWh needed, 4.6 MWh approved THIS WEEK: By Ken Haapala, President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP) Scope: TWTW begins with a paper by Richard Lindzen and William Happer calling for a repeal of the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) which provided hundreds of millions of dollars in subsidies to unreliable wind and solar. TWTW continues with the significant omissions in proclamations by NOAA and other organizations in claiming increasing carbon dioxide is acidifying the oceans. TWTW discusses assertions by organizations and individuals that climate misinformation should be criminalized, ignoring the fact that such organizations and individuals rely on information that fails to meet the standards of the scientific method. TWTW questions what is meant by an existential threat, then concludes with a presentation of part of the program of the upcoming DDP conference and where to register to attend in person or by Zoom. ********************* Repeal IRA Subsidies: Last week, TWTW focused on a paper by Richard Lindzen and William Happer emphasizing Gold Standard Science. “Scientific Knowledge Is Determined by the Scientific Method, Not by Government Opinion, Consensus, 97% of Scientists’ Opinions, Peer Review, Models that Do Not Work, or Cherry-Picked, Fabricated, Falsified or Omitted Contradictory Data.” This week, the CO2 Coalition published a paper by the same two authors titled “IRA Climate Subsidies Should Be Repealed.” The authors state: “Physics demonstrates that the Inflation Reduction Act’s (IRA’s) trillion-dollar climate subsidies rest on false science. The real science, which is virtually never reported, is that the IRA subsidies of $4.7 trillion (Cato’s estimate to 2050) aim to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions will have no climate benefit, for two separate and cumulative reasons: First, the physics of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases shows that reducing them to net zero will have a negligible effect on temperatures and extreme weather. At present, there are no effective replacements for fossil fuels, and eliminating them will be disastrous for people worldwide. The scientific fact is that doubling carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would increase the world’s food supply by about 40%, with a trivial effect on Earth’s climate. Second, the theory that GHG emissions are the primary driver of climate change is based on false science, such as consensus, theoretical models that do not work, fabricated and falsified data, agenda-driven peer review and government opinions. None of this is real science. (See our June 7, 2025, paper for details, Physics Demonstrates That Increasing Greenhouse Gases Cannot Cause Dangerous Warming, Extreme Weather or Any Harm.) In summary, IRA subsidies will waste trillions of dollars for no climate benefit, reducing carbon dioxide emissions will reduce the amount of food worldwide, eliminating fossil fuels will be disastrous for people worldwide, and the trillions of dollars would be better spent improving Americans’ standard of living. Accordingly, all the IRA climate subsidies should be repealed ASAP.” See link under Challenging the Orthodoxy. ********************** Another Significant Omission: The false Endangerment Finding by the EPA under Lisa Jackson in 2009 under the Obama Administration asserts: “elevated concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may reasonably be anticipated to endanger the public health and to endanger the public welfare of current and future generations.” The finding ignores or omits contradictory evidence including the only comprehensive global temperature data existing, the estimates of temperature from satellite evidence calculated since 1979 by Roy Spencer and John Christy and published monthly by the Earth System Science Center, University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH). Similar calculations by Remote Sensing Systems (RSS) independently verify their results. In 1998. Frank Wentz and Matthias Schabel of RSS discovered that UAH failed to correctly compensate for orbital drift. When the error was discovered and verified, Spencer and Christy quickly made appropriate adjustments, in keeping with the scientific method. Errors need to be exposed, verified, and corrected. Ignoring them or omitting them is contrary to the scientific method. For years, NOAA’s Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research has funded the Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL), a climate modeling laboratory at Princeton. NOAA also funds the Cooperative Institute for Modeling the Earth System (CIMES), which is a collaboration between GFDL and Princeton University. For over forty years, GFDL and CIMES have ignored UAH data and have omitted validating their models against atmospheric data, which is where the greenhouse gas effect occurs. NOAA funds organizations that systematically ignore the scientific method and fail to test their predictions against physical evidence. The findings of these organizations cannot be considered scientific. Another NOAA activity that is considered scientific but fails the scientific method is ocean acidification which was boosted when environmental ecologist Jane Lubchenco was administrator of NOAA during the Obama administration from 2009 to 2013. The claim that adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere will acidify the oceans contains a bit of scientific fact surrounded by a bodyguard of lies and omissions. As a gas, water vapor contains no CO2 and has a pH of 7 which is neutral. But when it liquefies in the atmosphere and falls as rain, it absorbs CO2 making a weak acid, carbonic acid. All rain is carbonic acid and has a pH ranging from 4 to 6. Thus, it is common that in land areas with moderate to heavy rainfall, such as the tropics, the soils are acidic. Millions of years of rainfall have washed CO2 from the atmosphere into the oceans. Roughly, there is about 50 to 60 times more carbon dioxide in oceans than in the atmosphere. So, direct rainfall will slightly increase CO2 in the oceans, slightly lowering the pH. Yet after millions of years of rainfall, the oceans are alkaline with pH of about 8.1. A fact that NOAA and others ignore. To recall, the acidity or alkalinity of a solution is measured by the pH scale with 7 as neutral. The scale is a base 10 logarithm. Alkaline drain cleaner has a pH of about 14; bleach has a pH of about 13. Is bleach 10 times more acidic than alkaline drain cleaner? Hen eggs have a pH of about 8 (oceans 8.1); sweet cream butter has a pH of about 6.0 to 6.7. Does cooking eggs in butter make them acidic? Further, the areas in the oceans, called Marine primary production areas or regions, are areas where ocean upwellings bring carbon dioxide and other nutrients to the surface and marine life flourishes. Examples are the Grand Banks in the Atlantic off Canada, the area off Monterey, California, off Canada and Alaska, and off most of Europe. As with most such distortions, the claim of ocean acidification requires a huge ignorance of geological history. Mollusks evolved in the Cambrian explosion of life, about 540 million years ago, when CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere were about ten times what they are today. Marine creatures with shells containing calcium carbonate evolved before then, with even higher concentrations of CO2. Great limestone beds were laid down during the hot, high CO2 Cambrian period. Reef building corals evolved around 245 million years ago. Since then, Earth has experienced periods far hotter than today and periods with CO2 concentrations far greater than today. Reef-building corals have a symbiotic relationship with microscopic algae called zooxanthellae, which live within their tissues. The coral provides the algae with a protected environment and the carbon dioxide and nitrogen (for chlorophyll and other compounds) needed for photosynthesis, while the algae, through photosynthesis, provides the coral with energy, nutrients, and their vibrant colors. Changes in water temperatures, salinity, or solar irradiance can cause corals to expel the algae, turning them white. They are not dead but may need a different variety of zooxanthellae, which are diverse with many clades (groups of organisms believed to have a common ancestor) and types. There is no reason to assume that a modest lowering of pH will kill corals any more than slow changes in temperatures will kill them. However, human causes including sediment from land disturbances and destructive fishing practices such as using dynamite and cyanide do kill them. Water running into the oceans for millions of years often passes over many types of alkaline material resulting in a pH of about 8.1, alkaline. The best scientific explanation why increasing atmospheric concentrations of CO2 will not acidify the oceans TWTW has seen was written by the late Roger Cohen and William Happer ten years ago. The paper is mathematical, but the summary is clear. The authors begin the section titled Alkalinity of the Unbuffered Ocean with: Ocean water is salty because of the weathering of the earth’s rocks by rainwater, and because of salts dissolved from the ocean floor, especially near plate-spreading boundaries. The salt water contains positive ions (cations), mainly sodium Na+, magnesium Mg2+, calcium Ca2+ and potassium K+. For clarity, we can think of the ions as coming from the strong bases NaOH, and potassium hydroxide, KOH (lye) and much less soluble magnesium hydroxide, Mg(OH)2 and calcium hydroxide Ca(OH)2 (slaked lime). The ocean also contains negative ions (anions), mainly chloride Cl− and sulfate SO4− 2, which we can think of the anions as coming from the strong acids, hydrochloric acid, HCl and sulfuric acid, H2SO4. For want of a better word, we will refer to the cations of strong bases, and anions of strong acids as pH-independent ions. The concentration of pH-independent ions is unaffected by normal changes in the pH of water. Further, the authors explain how weak acids (notably carbonic acid (H2CO3)) make rainwater slightly acidic, with a pH = 5.4 (vinegar has pH ~ 3). The authors estimate that if the oceans were not buffered by weak acids, the oceans would have a pH of about 11.4. The Summary states [figures not shown here, boldface added]: “This minimalist discussion already shows how hard it is to scare informed people with ocean acidification, but, alas, many people are not informed. For example: • The oceans would be highly alkaline with a pH of about 11.4, similar to that of household ammonia, if there were no weak acids to buffer the alkalinity. Almost all of the buffering is provided by dissolved CO2, with very minor additional buffering from boric acid, silicic acid, and other even less important species. • Doubling atmospheric CO2 from the current level of 400 ppm to 800 ppm only decreases the pH of ocean water from about 8.2 to 7.9. This is well within the day-night fluctuations that already occur because of photosynthesis by plankton and less than the pH decreases with depth that occur because of the biological pump and the dissolution of calcium carbonate precipitates below the lysocline. [The depth where the rate of dissolution of calcium carbonate starts to increase significantly due to these changes in pressure and temperature.] • Doubling atmospheric CO2 from the current level of 400 ppm to 800 ppm only decreases the carbonate-ion concentration, [CO2− 3], by about 30%. Ocean surface waters are already supersaturated by several hundred per cent for formation of CaCO3 crystals from Ca2+ and CO2− 3. So, scare stories about dissolving carbonate shells are nonsense. • The ocean has only absorbed 1/3 or less of the CO2 that it would eventually absorb when the concentrations of CO2 in the deep oceans came to equilibrium with surface concentrations. Effects like that of the biological pump and calcium carbonate dissolution below the lysocline allow the ocean to absorb substantially more than the amount that would be in chemical-equilibrium with the atmosphere. • Over most of the Phanerozoic, the past 550 million years, CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere have been measured in thousands of parts per million, and life flourished in both the oceans and on land. This is hardly surprising, given the relative insensitivity of ocean pH to large changes in CO2 concentrations that we have discussed above and given the fact that the pH changes that do occur are small compared to the natural variations of ocean pH in space and time.” This is another instance where US government “science” is so politicized that it becomes nonsense. See link under Challenging the Orthodoxy. ********************** Censorship: An organization called the International Panel on the Information Environment has produced a report titled: “Facts, Fakes, and Climate Science: Recommendations for Improving Information Integrity about Climate Science.” The Synopsis of the report states: Misleading information about the causes and consequences of climate change obstructs effective policy responses. This Summary for Policymakers summarizes findings from the larger Synthesis Report “Information Integrity about Climate Science: A Systematic Review” (SR2025.1). The central conclusion of the Synthesis Report is that powerful actors—including corporations, governments, and political parties—intentionally spread inaccurate or misleading narratives about anthropogenic climate change. These narratives circulate across digital, broadcast, and interpersonal communication channels. The result is a decline in public trust, diminished policy coordination, and a feedback loop between scientific denialism and political inaction. There is a severe gap in research on climate information integrity in the Global South, where impacts are likely to be significant but poorly documented. Key takeaways from the synthesis include: 1. coordinated misinformation campaigns actively shape climate narratives; 2. scientific consensus is frequently misrepresented in media; 3. regulatory enforcement and access to data remain uneven globally; 4. information integrity research is heavily concentrated in the Global North. The report concludes with an assessment of policy recommendations that have been made over time, identifying for policymakers the four areas where impact has been consistently positive: • legislation to ensure standardized carbon reporting and labelling, • litigation to ensure enforcement of the standards, • coalition building across stakeholder groups, • education of policymakers and the public. This study delivers the first global, systematic assessment of information integrity about climate science. It draws on research by hundreds of scholars and thousands of peer-reviewed studies published over the past decade, with a methodologically rigorous review of 300 papers on policy solutions. This consolidated evidence base affirms a scientific consensus and specifies the urgent measures policymakers must enact to shield humankind—and the planet we depend on—from an accelerating climate threat. In short, this group proclaims that it understands scientific knowledge from “scientific consensus” and any group presenting physical evidence contradicting them should be punished. This organization produced another report titled: “Information Integrity about Climate Science: A Systematic Review.” It claims that [citations omitted here but in report, boldface added]: “The United Nations (UN) has played an important role in placing the issue of information integrity on public and policy agendas, including for the area of climate change. In 2024, the United Nations Global Principles for Information Integrity were presented; that year also witnessed the launch of the Global Initiative for Information Integrity on Climate Change, spearheaded by Brazil and coordinated through UNESCO. The Global Principles highlighted the need for ‘independent, free and pluralistic media’ around the world as vehicles of information and opinion formation. They also called for more “transparency and research” into whether and how traditional media and online communication platforms maintain information integrity in the public interest. That publication, however, stopped short of offering an explicit or operational definition of information integrity. This consolidated evidence base affirms a scientific consensus and specifies the urgent measures policymakers (see SFP2025.2) must enact to shield humankind— and the planet we depend on—from an accelerating climate threat.” Writing in WUWT, Eric Worrall uncovered a UN Human Rights Council report that calls for punishment of those who oppose abandoning fossil fuels. The summary of the report states: “The present report clarifies States’ international human rights obligations and businesses’ responsibilities to phase out fossil fuels and related subsidies within the current decade. The interlinked, intergenerational, severe and widespread human rights impacts of the fossil fuel life cycle, coupled with six decades of climate obstruction, compel urgent defossilization of our whole economies, for a just transition that is effective, human rights based and transformative in protecting the climate, nature, water and food on which life and health for present and future generations depend.” [Boldface added] For example, Richard Lindzen and William Happer used the scientific method to expose the folly of Net Zero. Are they to be punished for producing physical evidence contradicting the claims of the UN organizations which, for years, have led the effort to abandon fossil fuels which are needed for reliable electricity, heat, and transportation? Do UN bureaucrats and their defenders believe they have the right to determine the truth of scientific principles? The quote of the week is: “No government has the right to decide on the truth of scientific principles.” — Richard Feynman. If misinformation on the causes and extent of climate change becomes a criminal offence, would the UN be a criminal organization? Has the UN become an advocate for causing destitute poverty and starvation (by prohibiting use of artificial fertilizer which produce greenhouse gases)? See links under Defending the Orthodoxy and Defending the Orthodoxy – Bandwagon Science ********************** An Existential Threat? It is commonplace for promoters of fear of climate change to call climate change an existential threat. But what the term means is not clear. Clinical psychologist Andrew Hartz provides an explanation of the use of existential threat. See Article # 1. ********************** DDP Conference: The 23rth annual meeting of the Doctors for Disaster Preparedness will be held in Tucson, Arizona, from July 4 to 6. The program features the 2022 Nobel co-Laureate in Physics John Clauser speaking on “Serious errors and fudges in the IPCC et al.’s global power balance structure, albedo, and climate feedback assessments.” Other noted speakers of interest to TWTW readers include Willie Soon, “Measuring the Earth’s Energy Budget”: Michael Connolly “Balloons in the Air: Revisiting Atmospheric Physics, with Data”; Joe Leimkuhler, “Prospects for the U.S. Petroleum Industry”; Jim Steele “Understanding Natural Climate Dynamics Best Prepares Us for Weather Disasters”; and David Legates “9.5 Weeks: My Time in the White House.” For registration in person or by Zoom see https://aaps.wufoo.com/forms/q1f6wbjr18g6o47/ ********************* SEPP’S APRIL FOOLS AWARD – THE JACKSON It is time for voting on the Annual SEPP’s April Fools Award – the Jackson. The grand prize is a large lump of coal. Last year, the deserving winner of the lump of coal was the US National Science Teaching Association. In 2023, the Association banned the CO2 Coalition from its meeting which the Coalition members paid for and were approved because the CO2 Coalition exhibit pointed out that CO2 is essential for photosynthesis which is the food source of all complex life on Earth. There are many strong candidates for this dubious honor including leaders of US scientific agencies who signed off on questionable reports on climate change. Get your votes in by June 29 with the reason why you recommend that person for the award. Send your vote to Ken@Sepp.org. If you wish, you will be anonymous. The award will be announced at the 43rd annual meeting of the Doctors for Disaster Preparedness on July 5-6. The decision of the judges is final. ********************* Number of the Week: 35,000 MWh needed, 4.6 MWh approved. DEMAND: On June 20, the business day with the longest period of sunlight, the California Independent Systems Operator (CAISO) reported that the demand trend for electricity fell to its lowest point at about 12:30 pm (local time) with a demand of 19,500 MW. About 6:30 pm demand began peaking at 28,000 MW and remained there or above until 10 pm when it slowly fell to 25,000 MW. Except between about 10 am and 3 pm, demand did not go below 22,000 MW. SUPPLY: On the same day, renewables (Solar, Wind, Geothermal, Biomass, Biogas, and Small Hydro) reached a near peak of about 25,000 MW at 8:30 am and remained there or more until 5:30 pm when they fell dramatically to about 7,500 MW at 8 pm where they remained the rest of the evening. When it is functioning solar is the biggest generator at over 18,000 MW with wind second at about 5,000 MW. Large hydro provided an average of about 3,750 MW for the rest of the evening and Nuclear about 2,280 MW. The rest of the electricity came from imports (mostly coal and other fossil fuels), and batteries. The government of California is trying to close its remaining nuclear power plant, small hydro and all fossil fuel power imports and rely on solar, wind, and storage. On the longest business day of the year for sunshine, after 8:00 pm CAISO needed 28,000 MW of power until 10 pm when it slowly fell to 25,000 MW while renewables were delivering 7,500 MW and batteries were delivering between 7,000 and 8,000 MW until 10 pm when they declined. Based on rough calculations, just for that evening (8 pm to midnight) CAISO needed 110,000 MWh of power while renewables delivered 30,000 MWh and the power delivered by large hydro alone was about 14,280 MWh. Thus, taking away nuclear, the shortfall would be about 35,000 MWh. Existing batteries delivered about 27,000 MWh and California just approved the “World’s Largest’ Energy Storage Site” with 4,600 kWh (4.6 MWh) of battery storage with no costs given. If California goes net zero with no nuclear, what will California do on a cold, windless night in January? How will it replenish its batteries? If California cannot deliver the nuclear power needed by the Bonneville Power Administration to supplement its large hydro, will the Administration continue to deliver hydropower to California? According to the US EIA, except for isolated Hawaii, residential electricity prices in California are already the highest in the country. In March, the US national average was 17.11 cents per kilowatt-hour, while in California it was 32.41 cents per kilowatt-hour and Hawaii 41.11.

Darwall: Yes, I think I can. Because in 2006 there was the meeting of the G8 which was in St Petersburg hosted by Vladimir Putin. And the leaders of the west along with Vladimir Putin signed up to a document called the St. Petersburg Principles of Energy Security. In that document the leaders of the west said that they needed to invest trillions of dollars across all the value chain, the whole oil and gas value chain.

Santer, Susan Solomon, et al., PNAS, June 16, 2025 [H/t Bernie Kepshire] From the abstract: The physics of the heat-trapping properties of CO were established in the mid-19th century, as fossil fuel burning rapidly increased atmospheric CO levels. To date, however, research has not probed when climate change could have been detected if scientists in the 19th century had the current models and observing network. We consider this question in a thought experiment with state-of-the-art climate models. [SEPP Comment: A thought fantasy, not a thought experiment. The state-of-the-art climate models produce results that are wrong. Why bother with a thought experiment until the state-of-the-art models produce accurate predictions that are supported by physical evidence? Further, in the mid-19th century, Europe was emerging from the Little Ice Age which killed hundreds of thousands from starvation and related diseases. Why would warming be considered harmful to humanity? Finally, the authors cite the early work of Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius but not his 1908 paper which admitted his early work was wrong. But he also misunderstood the chemistry of water vapor, it is not gaseous carbonic acid.] Warning signs on climate flashing bright red: Top scientists By Marlowe Hood, Phys.org, June 19, 2025 Link to paper: Indicators of Global Climate Change 2024: annual update of key indicators of the state of the climate system and human influence By Piers Forster, et al.

Or not, once they see how tiny the effects are in the alarmists’ own calculations. For instance, if we assume climate sensitivity to a doubling of atmospheric CO2 is a 3°C temperature increase, and that the US cuts its emissions right away by 40 percent, by the year 2100 global warming will have been reduced by… 0.06 degrees C. Put that in your thermometer and measure it.

Beijing began building 94.5 gigawatts (GW) of new coal-powered capacity in 2024, in addition to resuming 3.3 GW of suspended projects. This is the highest level of construction in the past 10 years! As recently as May, China deployed the world’s largest fleet of driverless mining trucks to fast-track efficient operations, partially to overcome the challenging conditions of harsh winter weather at the Yimin coal mine in northeastern Inner Mongolia. Oceans absorb 30% of our emissions, driven by a huge carbon pump. Tiny marine animals are key to working out its climate impacts Marine life known as zooplankton might be the biggest problem with getting carbon cycling right in climate models.

The 46+ year trend remains at +0.15 C/decade, but we note the value is +0.155 C/decade, so we added another decimal point in the header. We estimate the error range of this trend over 46+ years at ±0.03 C/decade which renders the third decimal inconsequential. Changing Weather Water Shortage? Blame It On Climate Change!! By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, June 19, 2025 Quite how they think they can get away with such bare-faced lies is a mystery. They clearly don’t want to put too much emphasis on mass immigration, which has forced up population numbers, even though they now assume population in England will rise by 8 million in the next thirty years. But lying about climate change is now a stock in trade for government. [SEPP Comment: See link immediately below.] Droughts To Cause Flooding!

This sponsored “journalism” by the infamous Seattle Times ClimateLab, is based on a report by a well-known climate change advocacy group, Climate Central. Communicating Better to the Public – Use Yellow (Green) Journalism? A weak wind By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, June 18, 2025 So, what has the Washington Post to say on the quietest hurricane season globally since 1970? Why, it was completely quiet about it. (As it was on “climate” save for a mention of a prediction from the Climate Prediction Center.) Unless you count “This spurt of activity shows no signs of ending for now.” Yes. “This spurt of activity” is actually how they describe the quietest start to a season in more than half a century. Satire can’t keep up. And no matter how cynical you get, it’s not enough. Major Errors in Seattle Times ClimateLab Article on Sea-level Rise By Cliff Mass, Weather Blog, June 20, 2025 My frustration with the often false, misleading, and exaggerated information pushed by the Seattle Times ClimateLab is frequently expressed in this blog, but the tall tales provided this week is worth a rating of at least four Pinocchios. The story suggests that the Samish Tribe of NW Washington has to “race” to document their heritage sites because rising sea level and “intensifying storm surges” remove any chance to understand their significance.” In reality, none of this is true.

Consequently, our understanding of the microplastics distribution across ocean depths is more limited. Here we synthesize depth-profile data from 1,885 stations collected between 2014 and 2024 to provide insights into the distribution and potential transport mechanisms of subsurface (below about 50-cm depth, which is not usually sampled by traditional practices) microplastics throughout the oceanic water column.

May be hot, maybe not By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, June 18, 2025 Point zero six above 2020? Can they say with a straight face that they’ve measured global temperature comprehensively to that degree of precision? Of course not. We’re not even buying the 0.1, let alone the 2 that followed it. As for that estimated 1850-1900 average, as we’ve said before, if you think we know the temperature for every square foot of what was then the Belgian Congo in 1873, or the mid-Pacific, or for that matter Rome, you are a chump or worse. IRA Incentives Fuel U.S. Solar Manufacturing Surge By Aaron Larson, Power Mag, June 11, 2025 The centerpiece of this revival is the IRA’s comprehensive package of tax incentives designed to rebuild America’s solar supply chain. The domestic content bonus tax credit offers project developers an additional 10% on top of the base 30% investment tax credit (ITC) when they use U.S.-made components. This creates demand-side pull for domestically manufactured solar products. According to U.S. Treasury Department data, more than $196 billion in clean power investments have been announced since the IRA’s passage, demonstrating the market’s strong response to these incentives. [Boldface added] [SEPP Comment: More deceit, America never had a solar supply chain to rebuild.] Communicating Better to the Public – Use Propaganda Amber Alerts For Sunny Weather By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, June 19, 2025 “Amber heat health alerts are in place across the whole of England with temperatures likely to exceed 30C [86F] for the first time this year.” Meanwhile back in the real world, summer remains the season when deaths tolls are at their lowest: ‘Climate Grieving’ at UK Centre for Climate Psychology By Robert Bradley Jr., Master Resource, June 17, 2025 The organization has a flagship book, Climate, Psychology and Change: Reimagining Psychotherapy in an Era of Global Disruption and Climate Anxiety.

The science is clear: the use of fossil fuels must end, immediately, if we hope to survive. Instead of leading the transition, our government gambles our future on unproven technologies and hopeful thinking… while quietly continuing to fund and faciliate the fossil fuel death project. Questioning European Green Kathryn Porter Reviews The Spanish Blackouts Report By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, June 20, 2025 Link to: Should NESO [UK Electrical system operator] be allowed to lower its minimum inertia requirement? By Kathryn Porter, Watt-Logic, June 18, 2025 From Porter: Whether this ambition will be possible even with the dodgy carbon accounting rules is unclear. In the summer months, gas power stations are often turned up by the system operator in order to stabilize the grid, providing important inertia to control voltage across the network. Throughout the summer, NESO has observed unexplained voltage oscillations (which I will discuss in another post – this is being held up by junk frequency data being reported to Elexon which has yet to be corrected, despite Elexon requesting re-submission), including on the day before the Iberian blackout. These oscillations can, in extreme circumstances, cause the type of grid failure that led to the loss of eleven lives on 28 April in Spain and Portugal. Spain’s Impossible Dream Of ‘Green’ Electricity By Paul Driessen, WUWT, June 17, 2025 How Much Does The UK Govt Spend On Net Zero By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, June 17, 2025 But even the quantifiable costs above add up to £24 billion a year, excluding Sizewell C [Nuclear power plant].

Questioning Green Elsewhere G-7: Africans Deserve Real Electricity By Brenda Shaffer, Real Clear Energy, June 17, 2025 Data on electricity access in U. S. government, IEA, World Bank, and UN reports should be categorized as reliable or not. Africans receiving a few hours a day of unreliable power should not be counted as achieving full electricity access. ‘Net Zero’ Is Collapsing in U.S. States By Steve Goreham, Master Resource, June 16, 2025 Tidbits By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, June 18, 2025 So, how’s that green transition working for you? Oh. Not so good? For instance, from way down south we hear that “The initial cost of producing green hydrogen from Australia’s two largest projects will be more than four times the price of rival energy sources, posing a fresh setback for Labor’s bid to deliver a major new export ­industry by 2030 and meet net-zero goals.” And you told us you had it all figured out. Blockbuster: Mark Carney, Mr Net-Zero-Banker himself, now uses oil, gas to make Canada an Energy SuperPower By Jo Nova, Her Blog, June 17, 2025 The US is the world’s top producer of oil at the moment, with 44 billion barrels of oil in reserve. Amazingly Canada has four times as much — or 171 billion barrels of oil in recoverable reserves, says the Telegraph. It’s amazing how stupid rich countries can be — to leave, as Alberta’s premier says, “$9 trillion worth of oil wealth we have in the ground”? Speaking of stupid, perhaps the greatest and saddest irony is that Mark Carney once was the green-extreme Governor of the Bank of England. And while there, he helped tie the UK down in carbon markets and energy transitions that still cripple their economy.

By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, June 18, 2025 “The massive power cut that plunged huge swathes of Spain and Portugal into chaos earlier this year was caused by a miscalculation, the Spanish government has said.” No, Sky, it was not a miscalculation. It was the inevitable result of running the grid mainly on highly variable, low inertia renewables. That in turn was the consequence of deliberate government policy. What will happen then, when Spain has succeeded in finally shutting down all of its gas plants? The Lethal Fog of Clean-Air Hypocrisy By Vijay Jayaraj, CO2 Coalition, June 18, 2025 Why do environmental extremists expect Nairobi, Dhaka or Lagos to skip the rational evolution of energy use that so benefited the lives and economies of the U.K. – and of many other western nations? Why do they think an African mother should wait decades – or forever – to cook without smoke? The answer lies in an elitist worldview that treats energy as a lifestyle choice rather than a lifeline. America as a Reliable Energy Partner By Fred H. Hutchison, Real Clear Energy, June 19, 2025 The statement that drew the fierce rebuttal was that “for fifty years Europe saw Russia as a reliable natural gas supplier… and now there is growing concern that Europe may be headed towards over reliance on liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the United States.” NESO Winter Outlook By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, June 20, 2025 “The National Energy System Operator (Neso), which oversees Britain’s electricity grid, said it would import power from France and other nearby European neighbors this winter to help backstop the network.” Homewood: NESO don’t publish the actual numbers – this will wait till their full Outlook later in the year. But they are projecting around 15 GW of renewables, which looks grossly optimistic. There will be no solar power generated when demand peaks in early evening, and we have regularly seen wind power drop to less than 2 GW. (Biomass, it appears, is included under thermal).

The flashpoint is centered on when large customers seek to bypass conventional transmission planning and cost allocation by co-locating directly with generation sources. That practice, often framed as “behind-the-meter” or “non-network” load development, has raised concerns from grid operators, utilities, and regulators who argue that even ostensibly self-supplied data centers still rely on the broader grid for backup, balancing, and reliability services.

The ultimate goal of energy tax credits is not to reduce tax burdens, but to help companies bring a larger amount of lower-cost and cleaner energy to the market — benefiting the American people. Cash is often preferable to tax credits in accomplishing that goal. The third policy is all the more relevant given this demand surge: restoring support for solar leasing companies. Solar leasing directly benefits U.S. homeowners by allowing them to install panels on their property with a monthly payment plan instead of swallowing the upfront cost. Not only does rooftop solar drive down consumer electricity costs, but it also gives Americans more independence by helping them to get off the grid and cut their reliance on utility companies.

By Leslie Eastman, Legal Insurrection, June 16, 2025 The greatest oxymoron statement of all time: ‘Renewable Energy’ By Ronald Stein and Roger Caiazza, America Out Loud News, June 16, 2025 Wind and solar projects that generate electricity under favorable weather conditions only exist because of government subsidies that finance these projects. To date, none of the wind and solar projects around the world have ever been financed with private capital, as there is no return on such investments. Claims that renewables are cheaper overlook the costs of backing up those sources when the sun does not shine and the wind does not blow. When included, costs are much higher.

At the bottom of the vogue for this exotic term may be the basic human fear of death. By Andrew Hartz. WSJ, June 16, 2025 TWTW Summary: The clinical psychologist and the founder of the Open Therapy Institute begins with: “So-called existential risks seem to be everywhere. Climate change, artificial intelligence, nuclear war, pandemics and more threaten to return us to nothingness. Most people using this term aren’t consciously evoking the philosophy of Sartre or Camus. Still, they may be drawing on associations with existentialism more than they realize and unconsciously expressing deeper concerns about morality and meaning. In psychoanalysis, it isn’t unusual for a word to have an unconscious double meaning. For example, a patient in therapy might say that she can’t ‘bear’ children. She could consciously mean that she’s unable to get pregnant, while also unconsciously communicating that she can’t stand children. Or a grieving patient who’s struggling to find the right word might say, ‘I’m at a loss.’ Similarly, the word ‘existential’ points to catastrophic global threats, but it also echoes the concerns of existentialist philosophy, which addresses a range of topics from freedom to alienation. But the term is most strongly linked in the public imagination to issues of death and meaning. Saying an issue is ‘existential’ can express that it’s deeply tied to one’s fear of dying and need for purpose. We don’t have to overthink every word we say or hear, but there are signals that a word may have an unconscious double meaning. Therapists tend to think this phenomenon is most likely to occur when a word is used in an odd way—when it’s emotionally charged, when it’s repeated excessively or when it has clear resonance with one’s psychological concerns. The recent political use of the word ‘existential’ seems to check every box. People in the U.S. are shouting about how politics is ‘existential’ at the same time that American society is suffering from a marked crisis of purpose. The term is strange and was used rarely in the past, but its use has been increasing as people have become less able to tolerate the risks and uncertainties of life. Recent events—the pandemic, geopolitical conflicts, the increasing secularization of society—could have triggered Americans’ existential concerns. Perhaps other factors are at play as well. For many, social-media platforms intensify feelings of insignificance. A loneliness epidemic might heighten anxieties about meaning. Distrust of authority can lead to feelings of confusion and insecurity. Whatever the causes, the sense that everything is an existential crisis is likely exacerbated by the increasing emotional fragility of younger generations. A prominent psychological theory, Terror Management Theory, posits that all people have anxiety about their mortality and that they cope with it in predictable ways. A robust body of evidence indicates that when people are reminded of their death, they try to boost their self-esteem, take steps to create a legacy and defend their worldview—be it secular or religious. An extension of this theory is that people cope with anxiety about death by focusing their fears onto something more tangible, such as a current political cause. That cause can then become emotionally loaded with all of their anxiety and distress about mortality. This temporarily makes their anxiety feel more manageable, but it’s likely to contribute to fanaticism and emotional dysregulation around politics. Political causes aimed at tackling ‘existential’ risks are often associated with safety culture. People seem to have an unconscious hope that regulations could protect them from ever dying. Sometimes, these rules and rituals even take on an obsessive-compulsive quality, as if the repetitions will magically stave off unknown risks. Many Covid practices had this flavor.” The author states the most clinicians think that fears of annihilation are fundamental influences on behavior which results in outlooks such as the world is going to be destroyed. He then concludes with: “Often, people come to yearn for an omnipotent state as the means to protect them from all their fears. They imagine total state control to protect them from all the internal feelings they can’t tolerate. Anxieties like this can easily become fodder for authoritarianism. Politics won’t solve our deeper problems. Meaning and purpose have to be found on one’s own, and people must develop ways to manage the uncertainties and risks of life. This can be challenging, but it’s the only path toward fulfillment, wisdom and freedom—to say nothing of mental health.” Subscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.

And if it’s censorship you’re looking for, then Britain is the place to be. Without question. And what’s more, we have a two-tier system of everything. What matters is not you, but your identity group. Who you “appear” to represent. Keeping the public agitated over the long term consumes the media. After a couple of warmer days during which the only real warming was at Fordow, we’re back to “public health”. “Modelling by the Royal Society for Public Health (RSPH), seen by the Guardian, predicts the proportion of year 6 pupils affected will increase to four in 10 (41%) by 2034-35. In total, rates of overweight or obese children will rise in 136 of 151 local authority areas (90%) in the next decade” https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jun/23/majority-children-overweight-obese-nine-areas-england-by-2035-study 90%? How in the light of our current economic circumstances does that work? Good news. Free school meals for all children in England on universal credit is rightly being celebrated by schools, nurseries, further education colleges and children’s charities. There may only be 500,000 extra recipients estimated by the government now, but in the long run 1.7 million children will be eligible, says the Institute for Fiscal Studies “Fantastic news,”says the Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG), as 100,000 children will be lifted out of poverty https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jun/05/free-school-meals-children-england-government Apparently, giving children a free school dinner (30 odd weeks a year) will save them from a life of poverty. I’ve never heard such a lot of rot. Actually, I have… Britain’s four-day heatwave – made 100 times more likely by the climate crisis – is expected to claim about 600 lives. Researchers say high temperatures from Thursday to Sunday would lead to a sharp rise in excess mortality, especially among older people in cities such as London and Birmingham. They forecast the deadliest day as Saturday, with temperatures above 32C https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jun/22/the-guardian-view-on-extreme-weather-build-national-readiness-or-let-everyday-life-keep-breaking-down It was three days…. and the thunderstorm has not materialised – yet. The tragedy is they believe their blatant, obvious nonsense whatever the weather. Where are these 600 stiffs, then? 32 degrees a heat wave? As Billy Bob would say – “you gotta be shittin’ me!” Apparently, giving children a free school dinner (30 odd weeks a year) will save them from a life of poverty. I grew up in the 60s in a large, one-parent family. The stigma of handing over my free dinner ticket to the dinner ladies never left me; in fact, it drove me to make sure I never had to ask for a handout ever again. I’m not rich, but I’ve done ok for myself. Although I’m not sure today’s kids have enough gumption to get off their fat arses and make something of themselves. As the ocean warms, a new study found it’s also changing color https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/environment/article308985125.html Supreme Court Rules Fuel Producers Can Contest California’s Emissions Regulations The 7-2 ruling emphasized that it was not considering the substance of the dispute itself, but solely whether the producers had the legal standing to bring the lawsuit. The justices in a 7-2 ruling overturned a lower court’s decision to throw out the lawsuit by a Valero Energy (VLO.N) subsidiary and fuel industry groups. The lower court had concluded that the plaintiffs lacked the required legal standing to challenge a 2022 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency decision to let California set its own regulations. “The government generally may not target a business or industry through stringent and allegedly unlawful regulation, and then evade the resulting lawsuits by claiming that the targets of its regulation should be locked out of court as unaffected bystanders,” conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote for the majority. What is this? “ If California cannot deliver the nuclear power needed by the Bonneville Power Administration to supplement its large hydro, will the Administration continue to deliver hydropower to California?” I was not aware that CA exported nuclear power to the BPA. “An organization called the International Panel on the Information Environment has produced a report titled: “Facts, Fakes, and Climate Science: Recommendations for Improving Information Integrity about Climate Science.” What a name! Why not just call themselves “The Ministry of Truth”? The government of California is trying to close its remaining nuclear power plant, small hydro and all fossil fuel power imports and rely on solar, wind, and storage. And what is so ridiculous is that even could they manage to do it, it would have no material effect on the level of global emissions. Because California is not a big enough emitter for it to make much difference to the global total. It is utterly crazy how people insist on doing these expensive and completely ineffective things ‘because climate’, when even if the theory is correct, they will make no difference to the climate.

Δ Overall, the index slipped a scant 0.02%, as six pillars lost ground and five pillars advanced. In doing so, the CE 100 pantheon outperformed all of its broader benchmarks, as, for example, the S&P lost 0.5%. Banking names surged the most, adding 3%. LendingClub advanced by 5.3%. The company announced the rollout of its LevelUp Checking. The new offering is designed to help consumers move away from reliance on credit cards, especially given record-high credit card debt, by incentivizing the use of debit with rewards tied to debit spending. Target customers are individuals with high FICO scores (around 725) and high incomes ($125,000 to $130,000) who, despite their earnings, often lack immediate cash and carry substantial credit card debt, CEO Scott Sanborn told PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster. “We’re saying that if rewards are important to you, that’s great, so let’s reward you for good behavior,” Sanborn told Webster in an interview. The new LevelUp Checking product gives members 1% cash back for everyday spending with a LevelUp debit card on grocery and gas, among other key categories. Members who have LendingClub personal loans can also receive 2% cash back for making on-time loan payments from the LevelUp accounts. JPMorgan Chase plans to launch a product called a “deposit token” that will serve as a digital representation of commercial bank money and will be available only to the bank’s institutional clients. The deposit token, dubbed “JPMD,” will provide an alternative to stablecoins and will be closely connected to traditional banking systems. JPMorgan Chase will launch JPMD on Coinbase’s public blockchain, Base. JPMorgan’s stock gained 3.8%. In the Pay and Be Paid segment, up 0.3%, Visa has partnered with licensed stablecoin payments orchestrator Yellow Card to explore stablecoin use cases and opportunities across the African markets in which Yellow Card is licensed to operate. Together, the companies will seek opportunities to help streamline treasury operations and enhance liquidity management as well as test integration opportunities with Visa Direct to investigate cross-border payment options, Visa said. Visa’s stock lost 4%. But buy now, pay later names were higher, marked by Sezzle’s 10% rally and Affirm’s 5% boost. As PYMNTS reported, Affirm has announced a new revolving pass-through loan sale facility in which PGIM Fixed Income, a Prudential Financial company, will invest up to $3 billion over 36 months by purchasing up to $500 million of Affirm loans at any one time. This facility, which marks an expansion of the companies’ existing capital partnership, will support Affirm’s offering of pay-over-time options to consumers, the companies said. The Be Well sector led declining stocks, losing 2.5%. Peloton dipped by 11%, trading lower since news earlier this month that Peloton introduced its own peer-to-peer resale marketplace, Repowered. Users can list their pre-owned equipment and accessories from the connected fitness company on the Repowered platform. Sellers determine the listing price, aided by a generative artificial intelligence (AI) tool. In the Enablers group, which lost 0.3%, OpenAI’s Sam Altman has reportedly accused Meta of offering nine-figure signing bonuses to poach his workers. Shares gave up 0.7%. Amazon’s stock lost 1.1%. In a message penned by CEO Andy Jassy, and as reported by PYMNTS, employees who have learned how to use AI will be better positioned to be a part of Amazon in the future. Jassy added that Amazon’s total corporate workforce is likely to shrink over the next few years as the company adopts AI. “Those who embrace this change, become conversant in AI, help us build and improve our AI capabilities internally and deliver for customers, will be well-positioned to have high impact and help us reinvent the company,” Jassy said in the message.
