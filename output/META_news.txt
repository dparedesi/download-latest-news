Pro Available to WrapPRO members Who’s most exposed when the AI rally finally comes to an end? What you’re missing: The Reset is a newsletter we send out every Sunday to the corporate enterprise subscribers to WrapPRO. If you think your company or organization would be interested in signing up for an enterprise plan, please reach out to our head of enterprise sales, Kimberly Donnan, at kimberly.donnan@thewrap.com. Happy Sunday, Part of any daily dialogue these days seems to include the argument over whether we are in an AI bubble. The sentiment changes almost hourly while the camp of of not if but when is picking up momentum. But it’s a rollercoaster. SoftBank selling its nearly $6 billion stake in Nvidia fueled bubble theories, but Nvidia’s knockout quarter reported on Wednesday seemed to shut those down — for now. The analysts’ estimates vary widely projecting that from 40% to as much as 75% of the stock market’s gains this year are attributable to AI-related equities. Either way, it’s substantial. This chart from Bank of America Global Research highlights the ongoing concerns of fund managers through a new November survey. Hollywood and the larger media sector have had a love-hate relationship with AI so far, which begs the question that if we are indeed in a bubble and that bubble bursts, how bad will it hurt business? Here’s a few thoughts on those with the most exposure: Netflix — A robust early adopter of AI for content personalization, dubbing, localizing programming, and automated trailer production has high exposure. Those tools depend on early-stage AI vendors that would get crushed if a bubble burst. Bottom line is that localization efforts, key to building sub growth outside U.S., would get more expensive. Disney — With its internal efforts at integrating AI stalling, Disney is increasingly looking at partners to help with production and VFX. It’s also beginning to use AI-driven personalization and robotics at its parks. A bubble burst would mean fewer outside options to fully take advantage of the capabilities of AI. Warner Bros. Discovery — AI isn’t much of a presence at WBD beyond the promise of the technology cutting costs from everything to marketing to production. WBD is pitching as positive a narrative as it can to Wall Street right now as it shops itself. The bubble bursting would kill that narrative, but presumably CEO David Zaslav would have sold the company already. Sony — Sony Animation and Crunchyroll are testing AI-dependent localization and subtitling pipelines. Its gigantic gaming division is experimenting with AI in the creative process, especially at the intersection of film and TV IP. What’s more, VFX shops, like Framestore, Weta FX and DNEG, are getting help from AI on so-called rotoscoping, upscaling and simulation. Same story: This kind of help comes from startups that would be wiped out in a bubble burst. It’s worth considering, too, the growing divergence between AI stocks and consumer sentiment, as the Wall Street Journal’s Greg Ip pointed out last week, highlighted by this chart. The so-called Magnificent Seven include Microsoft, Nvidia, Meta, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Tesla. Stepping back, an AI bubble burst would not kill innovation in Hollywood, to be clear. But it will be a setback and likely force the delay of any planned technology rollouts. One upside, I guess, is that a bubble burst might take some of the tension out of labor relations that have been rocky since AI arrived on the scene. Enjoy your Thanksgiving and see you back here next Sunday. Tom LowrySenior Vice President/Editorial Strategytom.lowry@thewrap.com 1. U.S. Political Divide Revealed on Social A recent survey from Statista Consumer Insights reflects pretty much the U.S. political divide on an even basis. Some light differences do show up in the survey conducted between October 2024 and this past September; Facebook is where centrists feel most at home. X is where partisanship is most visible, with more users leaning right. No surprises there. LinkedIn also leans more right with its more business-focused user base. Reddit is the one platform of those included in the survey that leans left. BlueSky, which was created at a time when Elon Musk took control of the old Twitter, was not included in the survey. 2. Streaming’s Sticker Shock We all feel the weight of subscriptions we are carrying but this chart fromLeverage Shares brings it all home. It shows the price changes for the most popular streaming services since 2019, with Disney+ topping the list at 172% inflation, a factor that probably made it easier for subscribers to drop the service over parent company’s decision to suspend Jimmy Kimmel. The inflation gives you pause to remember that streaming was created, in part, to be the low-cost alternative to traditional pay platforms like cable and satellite. But content is expensive and growth slows, and streamers feel like they’ve got the pricing power. But for how long? The work of determining the fate of Warner Bros. Discovery begins in earnest now. With bids submitted at Thursday’s deadline, let the due diligence begin. CEO David Zaslav will no doubt be leaning heavily on a team of advisors, no one more so than Paul Gould, the veteran investment banker with Allen & Co., one of the firms WBD hired to navigate a potential sale or split of the company. Allen & Co. has been advising media companies for more than half a century and Gould has been part of the team there since 1972. He is also an independent director on the WBD board, and has a long history of working with one of the company’s largest individual shareholders, billionaire cable mogul John Malone. The boutique investment bank is probably best-known for hosting its annual gathering of media, entertainment and tech executives every July in Sun Valley, Idaho. Gould is a fixture there. The confab has become known as the “billionaire’s summer camp.” But unlike the outsized personalities of the executives he serves, Gould is happy behind the scenes and famously press shy. In fact, the only photo we could find of him is the above picture from Sun Valley more than 10 years ago, walking alongside Malone. Gould has been an advisor on thousands of deals over the decades. Allen’s recent record includes the AT&T / Time Warner deal in 2016, advising Time Warner in its $108 billion acquisition by AT&T; advising Activision in 2022 in the nearly $70 billion acquisition by Microsoft; the firm advised on the 2015 separation of eBay and PayPal, a deal valued at $49.16 billion, the firm also brokered the Jeff Bezos’ 2013 acquisition of The Washington Post. The play for Warner Bros. Discovery is one of the biggest and most high-profile bidding wars in recent years for any company, not just in media. Zaslav will continue to be the public face of the unfolding drama. But you can’t underestimate the investment banker whose team is busy behind the scenes with an opinion or two about the potential buyer that will make the most sense.

US-based technology giant Amazon announced its plans to invest up to $50 billion into the expansion of artificial intelligence (AI) and supercomputing capabilities for the US government agencies through its Amazon Web Services (AWS), according to an official announcement. Amazon's investment in the expansion is aimed at improving the discovery and decision-making ability of the government agencies as they integrate their simulation and modeling data with AI, autonomous experimental steering and real-time feedback loops. “Our investment in purpose-built government AI and cloud infrastructure will fundamentally transform how federal agencies leverage supercomputing,” said AWS CEO Matt Garman. “This investment removes the technology barriers that have held government back and further positions America to lead in the AI era.” Amazon Web Services' (AWS) up to $50 billion investment is set to add nearly 1.3 gigawatts of AI and supercomputing capacity across AWS Top Secret, AWS Secret, and AWS GovCloud (US) Regions. The company will build data centres with advanced computing and networking technology power as part of its expansion efforts. According to the official announcement, the federal government agencies will gain expanded access to AWS's comprehensive AI services, including Amazon SageMaker AI, Amazon Bedrock, Amazon Nova, and Anthropic Claude, among other things. “These new capabilities will be available to existing and future U.S. government customers across AWS Top Secret, AWS Secret, and GovCloud (US) Regions, strengthening America's AI leadership and giving federal agencies the secure, scalable infrastructure they need for the next era of innovation,” the company said in its announcement. The investment will also contribute to critical US government and industrial base missions ranging from national security to scientific research and innovation, which includes autonomous systems development, cybersecurity, energy innovation, and healthcare research. According to a recent report from CNBC, Amazon's move comes after Meta and Anthropic's decision to expand AI data centres in the United States, and Oracle, OpenAI, and SoftBank's plan to invest $500 billion in the country's AI infrastructure. Amazon share price jumped more than 1% to $228.64 during the intraday trading session on Tuesday as of 11:53 a.m. (IST), compared to $226.28 at the previous US stock market session, according to the MarketWatch data. Shares of the tech and e-commerce giant have given more than 43% returns in the last five years, and over 14% returns in the last one-year period. On a year-to-date (YTD) basis, Amazon shares are trading 4.39% higher in 2025. The shares of Amazon hit their 52-week high level at $258.60, while the 52-week low level stood at $161.38, according to the MarketWatch data. The company's market capitalisation (M-Cap) stood at $2.42 trillion as of the stock market session on Tuesday, 25 November 2025.

Title: Larry Page becomes second richest person in the world after Alphabet share rally — What's his net worth?

Full Content:
Google co-founder Larry Page is now the second-richest person in the world, just after Tesla CEO Elon Musk. thanks to a bumper and ongoing rally in Alphabet stocks. Larry Page on Monday dethroned Oracle's Larry Ellison to snatch the position, according to the Forbes Real Time Billionaires List. Shares of Alphabet climbed 6.31% on Monday at close after a report said Facebook-parent Meta Platforms was in discussions to use Google's AI chips in its data centers from 2027 and rent chips from Google Cloud by next year. Alphabet stock price today continued its rally to touch an all-time high at premarket trading on Tuesday, rising over 3%. As per Forbes Real Time Billionaires list, the net worth of Larry Page stood at $267.5 billion on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Larry Ellison of Oracle slipped to the No.3 position with a net worth of $250.5 billion. Elon Musk remained the wealthiest person in the world, with his net worth hitting a massive $473.2 billion. On Monday alone, Larry Page's net worth climbed by $8.7 billion as per Forbes, thanks to the rally in Alphabet shares. The rally in Page's personal wealth over the past five years is impressive too, going from $50.9 billion in 2020 to $144 billion at the beginning of 2025. By the years end, he touched the quarter-trillion dollar mark. Larry Page is the co-founder of Google, one of the world's most recognised and valuable companies. Page founded the company with Stanford PhD student Sergey Brin in 1998, and used to be the CEO of Alphabet — the parent company of Google. Larry Page vacated the CEO office in 2019 but continued to remain a stakeholder at the company, which explains the meteoric surge in his wealth. At Google, he was the CEO till 2001. Shares of Google parent Alphabet have rallied almost 70% this year, outperforming other megacaps and bringing it close to the prized $4 trillion market capitalisation. Alphabet climbed 3.7% in premarket trading, bringing the search giant closer to a $4 trillion valuation. The rally came after the Information reported that Meta Platforms Inc. is in talks to spend billions of dollars on the search giant’s artificial intelligence chips. Meta is in discussions to use the chips — known as tensor processing units, or TPUs — in data centers in 2027, according to the Information, which cited an unidentified person familiar with the talks. Meta also may rent chips from Google’s cloud division next year, the news outlet said. Catch all the Business News , Corporate news , Breaking News Events and Latest News Updates on Live Mint.

Title: Nvidia Shares Fall Sharply Amid Talks Of Meta Mulling Use Of Google Chips
URL: https://www.ndtvprofit.com/markets/nvidia-share-price-movement-amid-talks-of-meta-mulling-use-of-google-chips
Time Published: 2025-11-25T15:07:42Z
Full Content:
Shares of Nvidia Corp. plunged nearly 7% during early trade on Tuesday following reports that Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. is considering using chips designed by Google. The slide put the stock on track for its biggest monthly decline since the market rout of 2022. The share price has fallen about 15% month to date. Google-parent Alphabet Inc. gained as much as 2.6% higher, after a more than 6% rally on Monday. The Information reported that Meta is considering using Google's tensor processing units (TPUs) in its data centers in 2027. Meta may also rent TPUs from Google's cloud unit next year, the publication reported. Google launched its first-generation TPU in 2018 and it was initially designed for its own internal use for its cloud computing business. Since then, Google has launched more advanced versions of its chip that are designed to handle artificial intelligence workloads. The company released its 7th generation TPU, Ironwood, this month. A Google-Meta deal would help establish TPUs as an alternative to Nvidia's chips, the gold standard for big tech firms and startups from Meta to OpenAI that need computing power to develop and run artificial intelligence platforms. Graphics processing units (GPUs), dominated by Nvidia, were initially designed to accelerate graphics rendering, particularly for video games and visual effects. However, their ability to handle large data sets and computations made them ideal for training AI models. In contrast, TPUs are specialised microchips, known as application-specific integrated circuits, designed specifically for a particular purpose. Last month, Google signed a deal with Anthropic PBC to supply up to 1 million of its specialised AI chips in a deal worth tens of billions of dollars. Meta's capex of at least $100 billion for 2026 suggests it will spend at least $40-$50 billion on inferencing-chip capacity next year, as per a Bloomberg report.

Title: BitMine Bags 70K ETH As PEPENODE Mining Meme Coin Nears $2.2M in Viral Presale

Strict editorial policy that focuses on accuracy, relevance, and impartiality Morbi pretium leo et nisl aliquam mollis. Quisque arcu lorem, ultricies quis pellentesque nec, ullamcorper eu odio. What to Know: Ethereum treasuries are back in the spotlight. BitMine Immersion Technology just snapped up another 69,822 $ETH in a single week, lifting its stash to 3.63M $ETH (roughly 3% of the entire circulating supply), and boosting combined crypto and cash holdings to $11.2B. The timing is spicy. $ETH has dropped close to 30% over the past month, dragging the value of BitMine’s treasury down from over $12B to near $10–11B before the latest rebound. Yet BitMine keeps buying, effectively doubling down on an ‘own the network’ thesis while its stock trades under pressure like other crypto-treasury plays. It’s the same tension playing out in Bitcoin land. Large $BTC treasuries have seen their market caps slump relative to the value of the coins they hold. And yet, while some $BTC has bled off, the drumbeat of acquisitions continues. This ongoing trend generates a weird split: corporate balance sheets hoarding blue-chip crypto, public equity multiples compressing, and retail investors left wondering whether to buy the coins, the stocks, or something else entirely. That’s where high-yield narratives like PEPENODE start to look interesting, particularly for meme coin hunting retail traders. Instead of owning a listed treasury at a discount, you effectively buy into a mine-to-earn meme ecosystem with direct token exposure, aggressive staking yields, and gamified virtual mining mechanics. PEPENODE ($PEPENODE) is built as a mine-to-earn meme coin on Ethereum, but it doesn’t ask anyone to plug in an ASIC. Instead, the project unveils a fully virtual mining simulator where holders use $PEPENODE tokens to buy miner nodes and upgrade digital facilities. Here, you’re building out customizable server rooms that generate simulated hashpower and rewards inside a web app dashboard. The idea is simple but clever; virtual mining rewards put in a meme coin wrapper and accessible from any basic Ethereum wallet. No rigs, no cooling fans, no angry landlord. PEPENODE also leans into the meme economy. The roadmap includes rewards not only in $PEPENODE itself but also in some of the best meme coins like $PEPE and other community favorites. These rewards will go to the top leaderboard players once the full game is live. On top of the gameplay, the presale already offers staking, not at a whopping 589% rewards for early participants, with emissions distributed over two years. It fits the project’s pitch: reward early backers aggressively while the mine-to-earn ecosystem spins up. For anyone watching BitMine push toward a validator-heavy future with its planned US-based staking network, PEPENODE feels like the retail, gamified interpretation of the same meta, just with memes, frogs, and a leaderboard instead of a Nasdaq ticker. Check PEPENODE’s official website for more. While treasuries like BitMine and the big Bitcoin holders wrestle with stock prices that occasionally drift below the value of their underlying crypto, $PEPENODE is still in pure token-issuance mode. That puts new buyers roughly in line with recent analyst models. Our $PEPENODE token forecast sees a potential high of $0.0077 for 2026 if the mine-to-earn game launches on schedule, exchange listings land, and crypto sentiment stays constructive. From today’s presale price, that implies a theoretical upside of roughly ~560% into 2026 under optimistic conditions. Learn how to buy $PEPENODE to join now. Instead of paying a premium or small discount for a listed treasury stock, whose upside is tied to multiples and macro flows, you’re taking on a high-risk, high-reward crypto with high-APR staking, decent upside potential, and optional exposure to multiple meme assets via the virtual mining rewards. Instead of just parking tokens and waiting for TGE, early buyers can stake immediately, then later deploy those same tokens into nodes and upgrades once Phase 3 of the roadmap kicks in. The result is a presale that behaves less like a static raise and more like a soft launch of the game economy. Explore the PEPENODE presale while early. This is not financial advice. Crypto and presale investments are highly volatile; never risk capital you cannot afford to lose.

Title: TJX Wins Without An RMN; Unlearning To Crawl
URL: http://www.adexchanger.com/daily-news-roundup/tuesday-25112025/
Time Published: 2025-11-25T05:01:54Z
Full Content:
The X Factor Big-box department and clothing stores are getting hammered. So why is TJX, the parent company of discount chains TJ Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods, crushing it right now? That’s a question recently mulled by Bloomberg writer Amanda Mull. For one, TJX has a few fortuitous tailwinds. Manufacturers over-acquired raw goods earlier this year to stock up for tariff-related price increases. That’s ideal for TJX, which buys products cheaply when other companies overproduce. But, also, TJX is not a retail media player whatsoever and cares way more about in-store sales than it does about ecommerce. In-person is simply a more exciting shopping experience, CEO Ernie Herrman told investors during the company’s quarterly earnings call last week. And that, he said, is something the competition lacks, excitement. Consumers are therefore “very open to trying us,” Herrman said. Other retailers have reshaped their store footprint around ecommerce warehousing and buy-online, pick-up-in-store fulfillment. Stores, in turn, become less appealing, sometimes as a direct result of retail media. Who remembers the Walgreens-Cooler-Screens fiasco? Don’t Crawl On Me Two roads diverged in a yellow wood: One leads to a partnership with OpenAI, the other to blocking OpenAI’s bots. In contrast to Walmart’s headfirst dive into agentic shopping, Amazon recently updated its robots.txt file to block more OpenAI bots from crawling its site, Modern Retail reports. ChatGPT has been providing more referral traffic for some retailers, like Walmart and Target, but Amazon prefers shoppers to purchase from it directly, rather than via ChatGPT. A primary incentive? Ads, of course. Amazon’s advertising business generates roughly $56 billion a year, according to Modern Retail, and depends on shoppers browsing its site. (People can bypass ads when they’re shopping via ChatGPT.) And so, for now, Amazon has been leaning into its own agentic shopping tools instead. Still, Amazon hasn’t fully ruled out future partnerships with third-party agents. During the company’s most recent earnings call in late October, CEO Andy Jassy said he expects to “find ways to partner” with these companies in the future. Bipartisan Haterade You know you’ve messed up as a company when politicians are reaching across the aisle to try and figure out what your problem is. Sens. Josh Hawley (R) and Richard Blumenthal (D) have asked the FTC and SEC to investigate Meta’s reportedly fraud-filled ad ecosystem, according to The Guardian. In a joint letter, the senators cited recent reporting by Reuters that Meta is involved in one-third of all scams in the US and made $16 billion (or 10% of its overall revenue) from fraudulent and scam ads in 2024. This isn’t the first time Hawley and Blumenthal have teamed up against Meta. In April, they announced an investigation into Meta’s alleged collaboration with the Chinese Communist Party to build censorship tools. And, last month, they introduced a bill to Congress that would require AI chatbot companies to enforce stricter age verification measures. Basically, any time Meta makes headlines for something egregious, expect these guys to respond with world-class hater energy. Speaking of which, a newly released legal brief suggests that, in 2019, Meta halted internal research when findings suggested that people who stop using Facebook report feeling less depressed. It should be fun to see what the senators make of that. But Wait! There’s More! Foreign content creators are making bank off America’s polarized political climate.

By Brendan Hesse and Jon Bitner on November 24, 2025 at 11:06AM PST GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links. Best Buy's Black Friday sale kicked off last week, bringing some massive deals to Nintendo games, hardware, and accessories--but some of the best deals are for Amiibo figures. The retailer has big deals on select figures, and has even restocked a several older releases. Some of the best savings are for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom characters like Sidon, Tulin, Riju, and Yunobo, which are steeply discounted to just $10 each (normally $30). Similarly, the recently released Street Fighter 6 Luke, Jamie, and Kimberly Switch 2 Amiibo figures are all 50% off at $15 (normally $30). Best Buy also has several hard-to-find characters in stock at their original $16 MSRP--undercutting the official Nintendo Store's new $20 price point. Among the highlights are long-running staples from the Super Mario series, including Mario Odyssey variants of Mario, Peach, and Bowser in their spiffy white wedding outfits. Best Buy also has several of the latest Amiibo releases in stock, including the new Kirby Air Riders, Donkey Kong Bananza, and Metroid Prime 4: Beyond collections, as well as preorders for upcoming figures like the Mario & Luma and Rosalina & Lumas Super Mario Galaxy Amiibo. Below is a list of all Amiibo available at Best Buy. Keep in mind that, while these are in stock at the time of writing, many Amiibo figures are popular and likely to sell out quickly, especially since most are cheaper at Best Buy than at other retailers. So if you see anything on your wishlist that's been hard to find for years, this is your chance to add it to your collection. These Amiibo deals are just some of the many Nintendo discounts available in Best Buy's early Black Friday sale. Those who haven't pick up the Switch 2 console can grab bundle deals that include the Switch 2 and a digital copy of a game. Right now, the Switch 2 + Mario Kart World or Switch 2 + Pokemon Legends: Z-A bundles are available. The retailer also has deals on several original Nintendo Switch physical games, including Super Mario Odyssey, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, Nintendo Switch Sports, and more. You can also grab digital edition Switch games at Best Buy for lower prices than they're available at the Switch eShop. These offers will be available until Best Buy's Black Friday Sale ends on November 29--unless they sell out before then. Check a selection of Best Buy's Nintendo game and Amiibo deals below--and be sure to keep tabs on GameSpot's Black Friday Deals Hub for the best holiday price cuts on video games, Blu-rays, figures, and more. Nintendo Switch Deals at Best Buy -- Starting At $30 Amiibo Deals at Best Buy Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter: $10 ($30) The Chief of the Gerudo joined the Amiibo lineup in June as part of the Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom lineup. Best Buy is currently offering the figure for $20, down from its usual price of $30. $10 ($30) Another summer release that's part of the Tears of the Kingdom lineup, the lovable Yunobo Amiibo is also on sale for $20 (was $30). He's quite large compared to other Amiibo, yet still carries a reasonable price. $10 ($30) Sidon launched alongside the other Tears of the Kingdom Amiibo in June. He too is on sale for $20, and his figure looks pretty slick as he's holding the iconic Lightscale Trident. $20 ($30) Surprise, surprise--another Tears of the Kingdom Amiibo on sale for $20. The adorable Tulin is depicted holding the Great Eagle Bow, and a display stand. Like the others guardians, Tulin was released in June. $30 ($40) Released in June (alongside the TOTK Amiibo), Luke from Street Fighter 6 is on sale for $30. His figure can be used to save and load your outfit, color, and button settings. $30 ($40) Jamie is throwing a handstand for his stylish Amiibo, which is also compatible with Street Fighter 6. It was originally launched in June 2025. $30 ($40) The third member of the Street Fighter 6 Amiibo lineup, Kimberly is shown here jumping across the battlefield, a cloud of pink flowing in her wake. It was originally launched in June 2025 and is compatible with the Street Fighter 6 game. $50 Just released on November 20, the Kirby Air Riders lineup is a bit more expensive than your typical Amiibo. However, this figure does come with both Kirby and his Warp Star, and it's compatible with 20 Switch and Switch 2 games, including Kirby Air Riders, Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe, and Kirby And The Forgotten Land. $50 | Releases March 5, 2026 Kirby's rival wasn't left out of the Air Riders fun, as you'll find the iconic character and their Shadow Star for $50. It too was just launched on November 20 and is compatible with just about every modern Kirby game you can think of. $50 Equipped with a spear and a Winged Star, this Bandana Waddle Dee is ready for the races. As part of the Kirby Air Riders series, it's compatible with Kirby Air Riders and launched alongside the rest of the collection on November 20. $40 This new Metroid Prime 4 Amiibo dropped on November 6. Featuring Samus and her bike, Vi-O-La, it'll be compatible with the upcoming game when it arrives on Switch and Switch 2 December. $30 Samus has been given the Amiibo treatment numerous times, but this is the most recent. It arrived on November 6 as part of the Metroid Prime 4 series, and we're expecting it to be a hot commodity once the game releases next month. $30 | Releases December 4, 2025 The final Amiibo in the Metroid Prime 4 series releases the same day as the game--December 4. Sylux will likely serve as a primary antagonist, a mysterious bounty hunter about whom little is currently known. $30 The two heroic faces from Donkey Kong Bananza were given the Amiibo treatment on July 17, 2025. You can use it with the game to unlock Pauline's Diva Dress. $40 | Releases April 2, 2026 The Super Mario Galaxy 1 + 2 Collection arrived early this year, and early next year, you'll be able to get your hands on a few Galaxy-inspired Amiibo. This includes the Rosalina and Lumas figure, which is up for preorder ahead of its April 2 release. It can be scanned with the games to unlock a 1-Up Mushroom. $40 | Releases April 2, 2025 Also arriving on April 2 of next year is the Mario and Luma Amiibo. It can be scanned with the games to unlock a Life Mushroom. $20 The iconic Donkey Kong villain originally joined the Smash Bros. Amiibo lineup in 2019. After being out of print for years, King K. Rool returned in 2025 as a Best Buy exclusive thanks to the smash hit Donkey Kong Bananza. $30 The Metroid Dread Amiibo series released in October 2021, and this double pack gets you both the Samus and EMMI Amiibo. And if you're having trouble with the challenging game, you can scan the Samus figure for an extra energy tank, while the EMMI Amiibo gets you a Missle+ tank. $16 Based on the Link's Awakening remake for Nintendo Switch, the tiny, cartoonish figure arrived in 2019 and is still available at Best Buy for just $16. $16 Released in 2016, this version of Zelda was inspired by her appearance in The Wind Waker. It can be scanned into a variety of games, including Tears of the Kingdom, where it unlocks an exclusive paraglider fabric plus additional materials and items. $20 While Link and Zelda have seen plenty of Amiibo releases, only two versions of Ganondorf exist. This version was launched in 2023 as part of the Tears of the Kingdom series, and it's available at Best Buy for $20. It's typically offered for $30 when purchased directly from Nintendo. $16 Byleth is the star of Fire Emblem: Three Houses (which launched in 2019), but their Amiibo is actually part of the Super Smash Bros series. Released in 2021, it's compatible with Fire Emblem Engage, Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes, and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. $16 Released way back in 2015, you'll find this classic Amiibo at Best Buy for just $16. It's part of the Super Mario series, can be scanned into dozens of games, and features the mustachioed plumber striking one of his most iconic poses. $16 This version of Bowser launched alongside the Mario figure in 2015. He too can be scanned into dozens of games (including Super Mario Galaxy and Galaxy 2), and his large design makes him stand out among other, smaller Amiibo. $16 Released in 2017 and sporting his wedding attire, this quirky Amiibo is available for just $16 at Best Buy. It's part of the Super Mario Odyssey Amiibo series, which includes both Peach and Bowser. $16 Decked out in what have to be the nicest clothes in his wardrobe, Bowser looked pretty spiffy when this Amiibo arrived in 2017. Like others in this collection, it's compatible with a bunch of games--including Super Smash Bros Ultimate and Super Mario Odyssey. $16 Rounding out the wedding party is none other than Peach herself. Launched in 2017, you'll find the old, iconic Amiibo for $16 right now--though it'll likely sell out fast. $16 If the Wedding Outfit Amiibo seems a bit too flashy, you can pick up the Peach figure that's part of the Super Smash Bros series. It's even older than the Wedding Outfit figure, as it launched way back in 2014. $16 Another good option is Peach from the standard Super Mario series. This depicts Peach with her classic attire, and it's arguably the best Amiibo of the bunch. It was originally released in 2015. $16 Unlike Peach, Daisy has only been given the Amiibo treatment twice. This one is part of the Super Smash Bros series and originally launched in 2019. $16 As the iconic, eternal enemy of Mario, the lowly Goomba is both evil and adorable. The same is true of this Amiibo, which is part of the Super Mario series and first released in 2017. $16 Not one to leave their Goomba friends behind, the equally adorable Koopa Amiibo was released in 2017. It's part of the Super Mario series and is a popular collector's item. $16 Kingdom Hearts may have started as a PlayStation exclusive, but it found its way to Nintendo with the 2004 release, Chain of Memories. Sora then made the cut for Super Smash Bros Ultimate, and he became an Amiibo in 2024. $25 The Pearl and Marina Amiibo figures were released in 2018, though they remain popular to this day thanks to the launch of Splatoon 3 in 2022. $16 The lovable sidekick of Splatoon 3, Smallfry was immortalized as an Amiibo a few months after the game release in 2022. The figure looks adorable, with Smallfry just as emotive as they are in the game. $16 Another launch that followed hot on the heels of Splatoon 3. The colorful Octoling is available for $16 at Best Buy, and it unlocks exclusive gear in Splatoon 3 and is compatible with several other games. $30 Though most fans are probably holding out for a Chicken Jockey Amiibo, for now you can make do with the Steve and Alex double pack. These released as part of the Super Smash Bros collection in 2022.

Google Alphabet stock price today: Alphabet stock jumped nearly 6% Monday as Google’s Gemini 3 AI model ignited a sharp rebound. Shares of GOOGL and GOOG traded above $300 for the first time and hit $317.75 intraday. Analysts said Gemini 3 outperforms OpenAI and Anthropic and uses Google’s custom AI chips, raising pressure on Nvidia, which slipped 0.5%. AMD rose nearly 4%. Alphabet has gained 70% in a year with Q3 profit up 39% and margins up seven points. Google Cloud revenue grew 34%, beating Microsoft and Amazon. Gemini traffic share rose to 13.7% from 5.6%.

Battle with Roy at Peach's Castle is retiring soon, but you can get this $65 Lego Mario set for $28 in Amazon's Black Friday sale. By Steven Petite on November 23, 2025 at 5:55PM PST Lego Super Mario: Battle with Roy at Peach's Castle (738 Pieces) $28 (was $65) | Retiring soon Update: This deal is no longer available. For the second week in a row, Amazon is selling a Lego Super Mario playset for over 50% off during its Black Friday sale. Last week it was Soda Jungle Maker, and this week it's Battle with Roy at Peach's Castle. Normally $65, this 738-piece building set is discounted to only $28. Like Soda Jungle Maker, Peach's Castle is retiring soon, so this is likely your last chance to get a massive discount on the set. Amazon has already sold out of this deal once today (November 23), but the deal is back in stock as of 5:55 PM PT. Battle with Roy at Peach's Castle comes with three buildable Lego Super Mario figures: Roy, Red Toad, and a Chain Chomp that pulls Roy's sled. It doesn't include Peach, who is only available as an interactive figure in the Super Mario Adventures Starter Set, which is on sale for $40 (was $50). The castle's fold-out walls are destructible, so you can easily refortify your defenses after Chain Chomp crashes into them. Toad can sling projectiles at Roy and Chain Chomp with a built-in catapult atop the castle. If you have Interactive Princess Peach, you can tap the Action Tags on the rotating throne, in the small garden where Toad likes to hang out, and in hidden spots. Tapping an Action Tag plays music and sound effects from the Peach figure's built-in speakers. More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals & Preorders Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

Title: AI Data Center Overinvestment Debate Intensifies
URL: https://newsonjapan.com/article/147701.php
Time Published: 2025-11-23T20:35:47Z
Full Content:
TOKYO, Nov 24 (News On Japan) - A growing debate over whether major technology companies are overinvesting in data centers has emerged as one of the most closely watched issues in global markets over the past two weeks, as heavy capital spending by Meta, Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet triggers fresh questions about profitability, risk management and the long-term sustainability of AI-related infrastructure investment. While discussions about excessive spending on data centers have surfaced periodically since earlier this year, concerns intensified in early November after Meta announced the issuance of large-scale corporate bonds to finance new data-center infrastructure. Amazon followed with multi-trillion-yen bond issuance of its own, accelerating investor unease that Big Tech may be committing to expansion on a scale that will be difficult to recover through future earnings. Analysts note that similar alarms were raised in the spring, when Microsoft’s rapid increase in data-center investment briefly pushed its share price downward. Although Microsoft later demonstrated stronger-than-expected cloud profitability, restoring the stock’s momentum, recent market reactions suggest that investors are once again sensitive to the possibility of overcapacity. At the center of the market’s short-term anxiety is Nvidia, whose earnings announcement was scheduled for release on the evening of November 6th U.S. time. Although Nvidia is the world’s largest listed company by market capitalization and its quarterly results draw global attention, industry specialists argue that Nvidia itself is not responsible for the potential overinvestment problem. Because the company does not build data centers—supplying only the semiconductors used within them—its exposure to investment risk remains limited. The current concerns, they say, relate primarily to the companies constructing the facilities, not the device manufacturers responding to orders. Capital-expenditure forecasts compiled by market analysts illustrate the divide: Apple and Nvidia appear at the bottom in terms of anticipated outlays, while Meta, Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft and Oracle show steep upward investment trajectories. Apple, in particular, has deliberately avoided the data-center arms race, choosing instead to rely on hybrid models using external AI infrastructure rather than directly competing in facility construction. Oracle, buoyed by demand from OpenAI, has recently accelerated its investment pace. Meta’s stock has come under especially heavy selling pressure, with the company falling nearly 10 percent following its bond-issuance announcement. Market participants attribute this reaction to two factors: first, CEO Zuckerberg’s remark that it remains uncertain whether the investment will translate directly into profit growth, but that “not investing now would be the greater risk.” Analysts viewed the statement as an inversion of normal capital-expenditure logic, prompting concerns about strategic discipline. Second, investors remain wary after Meta’s earlier push into the metaverse failed to gain traction despite major financial commitments and a corporate name change. Even so, some specialists argue that technologies dismissed as premature—such as AI a decade ago—can surge once the right market environment arrives. The long history of metaverse-like platforms, including the rise and collapse of virtual worlds such as Second Life in the mid-2000s, is often cited as evidence that cycles of enthusiasm and stagnation repeat until demand eventually aligns. For now, however, the data-center overinvestment question dominates market sentiment. Investors are watching whether the massive spending undertaken by major U.S. platforms can be justified by future profits—or whether companies like Apple, which has largely stayed out of the infrastructure race, will ultimately be rewarded for their restraint. The outcome, analysts say, will shape the competitive landscape over the next one to two years and could significantly influence the direction of global AI development. While discussions about excessive spending on data centers have surfaced periodically since earlier this year, concerns intensified in early November after Meta announced the issuance of large-scale corporate bonds to finance new data-center infrastructure.

Source: テレ東BIZ Tokyo announced on November 26th that it will overhaul its lodging tax system by replacing the current fixed-rate structure with a uniform tax equivalent to 3% of accommodation fees, a move intended to respond to sharply rising hotel prices. A powerful earthquake struck the Aso region of Kumamoto at around 6:01 p.m. on November 25th, toppling a residential gate in Aso City and scattering roof tiles across the road, while rockfalls and damage were reported in nearby areas. A Ferris wheel at the Expocity commercial complex in Suita, Osaka, known as the tallest in Japan at 123 meters, came to an abrupt stop on November 25th after a lightning strike disabled its operating system, leaving 20 passengers trapped in nine gondolas until the early hours of the following morning. A large-scale water outage continued across parts of Okinawa on November 25th after a damaged pipeline caused significant leakage the previous day, with local authorities reporting ongoing disruptions as of 11:35 a.m. Yellow dust is forecast to reach Fukuoka from the morning of November 25th through November 26th, prompting the city to urge residents—particularly those with respiratory or allergy-related conditions—to take precautions such as wearing masks when going outdoors. Nvidia maintains an estimated 80% share of the global AI chip market, but a surge of new competitors is beginning to challenge the company’s dominance, reshaping expectations across the semiconductor industry. Japan is often perceived internationally as adopting Al cautiously rather than rapidly. Yet 2025 is starting to show a different reality. Japan's digital currency sector has transformed from a Wild West frontier into one of the most carefully monitored markets in the world. A growing debate over whether major technology companies are overinvesting in data centers has emerged as one of the most closely watched issues in global markets over the past two weeks, as heavy capital spending by Meta, Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet triggers fresh questions about profitability, risk management and the long-term sustainability of AI-related infrastructure investment. A dramatic shift is beginning to unfold in software development as AI transforms programming into an everyday skill that no longer requires specialist expertise, a trend highlighted in a forthcoming set of 2026 technology forecasts compiled by Nikkei BP. Generative AI continues to evolve at astonishing speed, raising both expectations and concerns about a future in which machine intelligence surpasses human capability, and according to Shota Imai, a 31-year-old visiting professor at the Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology who is emerging as one of the country’s leading young AI researchers, the question now is how closely AI’s value systems can be aligned with those of humans, as breakthroughs since the arrival of ChatGPT push society into uncharted territory. ここ数年、日本企業では多くの大きな変化が起きています。その中でも特に注目されているのが AI OCR の活用です。 Apple’s position in the global race for artificial intelligence is increasingly in focus as questions continue to surface over whether the company has fallen behind Google and Microsoft, and how it compares with Nvidia, now one of the world’s most powerful semiconductor makers. © 2025 News On Japan.

Learn more › Sign Up For Goods 🛍️ Product news, reviews, and must-have deals. Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. It’s been a rough stretch for many budgets, thanks to tariffs and rising grocery bills. If you stashed money this year in a Flexible Spending Account (aka a Flexible Spending Arrangement) and managed to dodge major medical expenses, now’s the time to put those hard-earned, pre-tax dollars to work for you and stock up for 2026 before your plan’s deadline. While FSAs are best known for covering copays and over-the-counter basics—like anti-inflammatories and cold & flu meds, first-aid and emergency kits, and vision and eye-care—you may also be able to put that balance toward high-tech health wearables, mobility and recovery gear, or even certain specialty mattresses and e-bike setups with a doctor’s note. And there’s no legal reason you can’t take advantage of that FSA and a discount shopping holiday like Black Friday/Cyber Monday simultaneously, so scroll those sales ASAP! You’ve already used the funds to lower this year’s tax liability; now let them enhance next year’s life. A health FSA is an employer-sponsored benefit that lets you set aside part of each paycheck—up to $3,300 for 2025—into an account for out-of-pocket medical costs. You decide whether to opt in when you start a job or during annual open enrollment or other qualifying life events, and then determine how much to contribute from each paycheck. Think of it as a single-year health nest egg you can use for deductibles, copayments, prescriptions, and a range of eligible medical expenses. Traditionally, you submit a claim to your FSA administrator with proof of what you bought and confirmation that insurance didn’t cover it. Many plans now offer a debit card you can swipe like a checking account, but it’s still smart to save your receipts in case your plan—or the IRS—asks for documentation later. An FSA can be a powerful budgeting tool for people with predictable, recurring medical costs, such as a payment plan for braces, monthly insulin refills, or a new annual supply of contact lenses. But if your FSA is more of a “just in case” cushion, it’s easy to reach the end of the year with a surprising amount of money sitting there—and a countdown to spend it. Unlike Health Savings Accounts (HSAs), FSAs require you to spend your balance by December 31 or you forfeit the funds. Some employers offer a small rollover—up to $660—or a grace period of an extra month or two to use the remaining funds. For your plan’s exact rules, check with your employer. What’s covered by FSA reimbursement is determined by the IRS and must be a “qualified medical expense.” In the IRS docs, that’s defined as “costs related to the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or expenses that affect the structure or function of the body.” First-aid supplies and over-the-counter meds may come to mind first, but it can also include things like: Your FSA provider is ultimately the referee here. If you’re hoping to get reimbursed for something that isn’t clearly listed as an eligible expense, you may need a Letter of Medical Necessity (LMN)—essentially a note from your doctor explaining why you need it for a specific condition. With an LMN, some plans will cover things like vitamins, exercise equipment or fitness trackers, specialty pillows or mattresses, and even massage guns, as long as they’re prescribed to treat a documented medical issue and your plan signs off. It’s easy to find FSA-eligible items online; many vendors clearly label FSA and HSA items, and large retailers like Amazon, Target, Walmart, and CVS have dedicated portals. Supergoop! This staff favorite is one of the few sunscreens that some of us will put on our faces. It goes on invisible—no smeary white to rub in—and is virtually weightless. How does a liquid leave a powdery feel? We’re not sure about the chemistry, but we know it happens. And if you’re outdoorsy, it’s not just important during sunny summer, so it’s a perfect Add to Cart. Banana Boat Need a bigger bottle to smear on the kids? This family size provides SPF 50 protection that resists sweat and water. But remember: You’re supposed to put a shot glass’s worth of sunscreen on each time you head out in the rays. OMRON Blood pressure probably isn’t top of mind unless you know yours is too high or too low. Having a reliable monitor at home provides a convenient way to check your blood pressure more often than random clinical visits, which can help spot sudden changes or changing trends. Versions with arm cuffs, like this Omron Platinum model, tend to be more accurate than the wrist-worn kind. This model stores up to 100 readings for two users and syncs with the OMRON connect app to easily share reports with your doctor. Dexcom Part of the promise of tech-infused health care is more personalized care. The cost of devices like at-home glucose monitors has come down enough that people can now see how different foods, workouts, and even sleep affect their blood sugar in real time. This particular device was created for people with Type 2 diabetes not using insulin, those with prediabetes, and health-conscious adults. Johnson & Johnson This compact first-aid kit is small and inexpensive enough to stash anywhere you tend to do everyday damage and suddenly need a bandage. Inside are 80 pieces of essential care—hand-cleaning wipes, extra-strength Tylenol, gauze, Neosporin, and more—all in a package that fits easily in a glove box, desk drawer, or carry-on bag. FriCARE We stash these self-adhesive rolls of tape in all sorts of places: first-aid kits, sports bags, most notably. They’re latex-free, great for sprains or just holding gauze or large bandages in place without using the kind of tape that feels like it’s going to rip your skin off when you remove it. It’s even useful for furry family members (animal or human). Biotrue Contact solutions do expire, but regular users often find they fly through these 10-ounce bottles faster than they expect. This two-pack of multipurpose cleaner also comes with a new contact case to replace your crusty one. ThinOptics We know two things about readers: either you refuse to wear them, or you own a pair that’s never where you actually need it. ThinOptics solves that with ultra-slim specs that tuck into a case and attach to the back of your phone. They’re armless, resting on your nose like an old-timey pince-nez, and come in standard 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 magnifications. iHealth Is the coughing and sneezing some dust or something bigger? Stock up on these rapid 15-minute tests to get your first indications whether you have flu or COVID, and then plan out your next steps. Clearblue Preggers? Not preggers? Whichever outcome you want, this early-detection test finds even low concentrations of the pregnancy hormone and features a wide tip for, uh, easier collection. Some of the more surprising gadgets and big-ticket buys aren’t “swipe your FSA card and walk away” purchases; they usually require you to pay in full and do a little extra after checkout. But if you’re not afraid of some paperwork, some cool splurges can help you improve your health. For many, brands partner with a program like Truemed, which has you fill out a health survey after purchase so a licensed provider can review your situation and, if you qualify, issue a Letter of Medical Necessity. Then you simply submit the letter plus your receipt (sometimes only for the amount above a “basic” version), and your FSA administrator processes repayment. Here are just a few examples of tech you might have thought was cool, but could also be FSA reimbursable (confirm with your insurance/doctor before any major purchase). Ray-Ban Glasses are one of the most fun (or at least most functional) ways to burn through FSA funds—and if you wear prescription lenses, that can even include Ray-Ban Meta Wayfarers, aka AI glasses in disguise. They correct your vision and let you whisper questions to Meta AI (“What’s the currency conversion?” “Where’s the nearest coffee?”) while casually snapping photos and videos without doing the full phone-fumble. (This is a joy we’ve experienced first-hand on rocky ridges with the dog, where you need all your hands free but still want a picture of your furry friend against the horizon.) They’re also a great way to escape the tyranny of noise-canceling headphones: tiny speakers and mics aim sound at your ears so you can play music, get reminders, and still hear the real world happening around you. Plus, upcoming software updates will likely expand the capabilities, including their use as hearables (though there are already dedicated Nuance Audio hearing frames you can purchase as an FSA-eligible prescription pair if you’re more concerned with what’s audible than what’s AI). There are other Meta models that qualify. But no matter what frame shape you select, we also highly recommend getting Transitions lenses, so they pull seamless double duty as both your everyday specs with blue light filters and your stylish sunnies. One caveat: super-strong prescriptions (the kind that usually require high-index lenses) may not work in Meta Ray-Bans due to the delicate electronics, which could be damaged by the pressure required to insert the optics. Oura A discreet, screenless health tracker, the Oura Ring 4 goes far beyond sleep. It automatically tracks activity, blood oxygen, heart and respiratory rate, and skin temperature changes, then turns those metrics into clear, behavior-focused guidance in the app. You can even log personal factors—like caffeine intake or alcohol consumption—to see what’s affecting your rest. It’s ideal for people who care more about health insights than hardcore fitness training stats, and who want something smaller and subtler than a smartwatch. To unlock the full features of the ring, a membership is also required. Other wearables—Garmin smartwatches, for example—can qualify for reimbursement with a post-purchase Truemed assessment and approval. While select sleep and heart-rate monitors (and smart scales) don’t even require that. Ride1Up Exercise is a huge part of staying healthy—and yes, some e-bikes can qualify for FSA spending. We’re talking Class 1 e-bikes only: operable pedals, no throttle, and a max assist speed of 20 mph to make sure you get some sort of workout.At Ride1Up, for example, you can choose from the road-ready CF Racer1 (pictured above), the off-road TrailRush, or the commuter-friendly Prodigy v2. After checkout, Ride1Up will send you a quick Truemed health survey, and if you’re approved, you’ll get the Letter of Medical Necessity you need to submit your purchase for FSA reimbursement. If there’s another ebike brand you’ve been eyeing, it’s worth checking their site. Purple Much like e-bikes, mattresses usually require a Letter of Medical Necessity, and not every model qualifies. You need features that go beyond a basic bed—pressure relief, targeted support, cooling layers, or designs that help with pain or sleep issues—which means going beyond a basic bed’s price. For example, Purple’s RestorePlus Hybrid (pictured above) fits the bill with three inches of GelFlex Grid that contours to your body, supports your lower back, and sleeps cooler than traditional materials. Funds will come in handy when purchasing a multithousand-dollar mattress, but as owners of a Purple RejuvenatePremier (as well as a lumbar back cushion for long-haul flights), we can vouch for the namesake material’s relief return on investment. Keep in mind that often only part of the mattress is eligible for reimbursement—usually the amount that exceeds the price of a basic mattress. After purchase, Purple partners with Truemed, which sends a quick medical survey plus simple instructions for submitting that eligible portion to your HSA/FSA administrator. Other mattress manufacturers may have similar setups. Chirp Chronic pain sufferers might be interested in the Halo, a $199.99 device that combines TENS and EMS technologies to deliver electrical pulses that both block pain signals and increase blood flow to sore areas. The charging case holds two Halo pucks, a rechargeable remote, extension cables, and a set of reusable magnetic pads. Not sure where to place the pads? The companion app shows you exactly where to apply them based on your pain points. You can choose from six preset programs and still adjust the intensity and duration to your comfort level. Purchases through the Chirp website can be made with FSA/HSA cards, though the company notes you may need additional documentation for reimbursement. Theragun There are massage guns and then there are Theraguns. The $649.99 PRO Plus doesn’t just hammer whatever hurts; the app gives you smart, guided routines so you’re treating the right muscles (often the ones around the sore spot). When you connect a Garmin, Apple Watch, Strava, or Google Fit, it pulls in your activity to build personalized recovery plans based on your goals, actual workouts, and current science. Hardware-wise, it’s fully loaded: hot attachments for soothing warmth, built-in LED light therapy (a miniaturized panel like those skin tone/texture therapy Glo masks, which are also FSA eligible), plus all the classic heads—standard ball, dampener, thumb, wedge, and micro-point. If you want to go full hot-and-cold recovery geek, you can even add a separate cold attachment. It’s basically a high-end recovery studio. Before your deadline hits, run through this quick list to make sure you’re getting the most out of your FSA balance: 2025 Holiday Gift Guide By Andrew Coletti By Stan Horaczek By Heather Kuldell-Ware By Fiona Tapp By Terry Sullivan By Carsen Joenk By Terry Sullivan By Jen McCaffery By Vinny Panza By Abby Ferguson By Tony Ware By Heather Kuldell-Ware By Terri Williams By Stack Commerce By Brandt Ranj By Nick Hilden By Fiona Tapp By Stan Horaczek Breakthroughs, discoveries, and DIY tips sent every weekday.

If you're searching for elusive Amiibo this holiday season, consider taking a peek at Best Buy during its Black Friday Sale event. The retailer currently has Amiibo in stock that are sold out at most other locations--including several that have been out of print for years. Many of these are available for their original $16 MSRP, undercutting the official Nintendo Store's new $20 price point. Among the highlights are long-running staples from the Super Mario series, including the recently released Mario & Luma and Rosalina & Lumas Super Mario Galaxy Amiibo figures. You can also pick up the Mario Odyssey variants of Mario, Peach, and Bowser in their spiffy white wedding outfits. You can also grab The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom characters like Sidon, Tulin, Riju, and Yunobo for $20 each, down from their usual $30. Best Buy also has several of the latest Amiibo releases in stock right now, including the new Kirby Air Riders, Donkey Kong Bananza, and Metroid Prime 4: Beyond collections. Below you'll find a list of all of the Amiibo available at Best Buy. Keep in mind that, while these are in stock at the time of writing, many Amiibo figures are popular and likely to sell out quickly, especially since most are cheaper at Best Buy than at other retailers. So if you see anything on your wishlist that's been hard to find for years, this is your chance to add it to your collection. These Amiibo deals are just some of the many Nintendo discounts available in Best Buy's early Black Friday sale. Those who haven't pick up the Switch 2 console can grab bundle deals that include the Switch 2 and a digital copy of a game. Right now, the Switch 2 + Mario Kart World or Switch 2 + Pokemon Legends: Z-A bundles are available. The retailer also has deals on several original Nintendo Switch physical games, including Super Mario Odyssey, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, Nintendo Switch Sports, and more. You can also grab digital edition Switch games at Best Buy for lower prices than they're available at the Switch eShop. These offers will be available until Best Buy's Black Friday Sale ends on November 29--unless they sell out before then. Check a selection of Best Buy's Nintendo game and Amiibo deals below--and be sure to keep tabs on GameSpot's Black Friday Deals Hub for the best holiday price cuts on video games, Blu-rays, figures, and more. Nintendo Switch Game Deals at Best Buy -- Starting At $30 Amiibo Deals at Best Buy $20 ($30) The Chief of the Gerudo joined the Amiibo lineup in June as part of the Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom lineup. Best Buy is currently offering the figure for $20, down from its usual price of $30. $20 ($30) Another summer release that's part of the Tears of the Kingdom lineup, the lovable Yunobo Amiibo is also on sale for $20 (was $30). He's quite large compared to other Amiibo, yet still carries a reasonable price. $20 ($30) Sidon launched alongside the other Tears of the Kingdom Amiibo in June. He too is on sale for $20, and his figure looks pretty slick as he's holding the iconic Lightscale Trident. $20 ($30) Surprise, surprise--another Tears of the Kingdom Amiibo on sale for $20. The adorable Tulin is depicted holding the Great Eagle Bow, and a display stand. Like the others guardians, Tulin was released in June. $30 ($40) Released in June (alongside the TOTK Amiibo), Luke from Street Fighter 6 is on sale for $30. His figure can be used to save and load your outfit, color, and button settings. $30 ($40) Jamie is throwing a handstand for his stylish Amiibo, which is also compatible with Street Fighter 6. It was originally launched in June 2025. $30 ($40) The third member of the Street Fighter 6 Amiibo lineup, Kimberly is shown here jumping across the battlefield, a cloud of pink flowing in her wake. It was originally launched in June 2025 and is compatible with the Street Fighter 6 game. $50 Just released on November 20, the Kirby Air Riders lineup is a bit more expensive than your typical Amiibo. However, this figure does come with both Kirby and his Warp Star, and it's compatible with 20 Switch and Switch 2 games, including Kirby Air Riders, Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe, and Kirby And The Forgotten Land. $50 | Releases March 5, 2026 Kirby's rival wasn't left out of the Air Riders fun, as you'll find the iconic character and their Shadow Star for $50. It too was just launched on November 20 and is compatible with just about every modern Kirby game you can think of. $50 Equipped with a spear and a Winged Star, this Bandana Waddle Dee is ready for the races. As part of the Kirby Air Riders series, it's compatible with Kirby Air Riders and launched alongside the rest of the collection on November 20. $40 This new Metroid Prime 4 Amiibo dropped on November 6. Featuring Samus and her bike, Vi-O-La, it'll be compatible with the upcoming game when it arrives on Switch and Switch 2 December. $30 Samus has been given the Amiibo treatment numerous times, but this is the most recent. It arrived on November 6 as part of the Metroid Prime 4 series, and we're expecting it to be a hot commodity once the game releases next month. $30 | Releases December 4, 2025 The final Amiibo in the Metroid Prime 4 series releases the same day as the game--December 4. Sylux will likely serve as a primary antagonist, a mysterious bounty hunter about whom little is currently known. $30 The two heroic faces from Donkey Kong Bananza were given the Amiibo treatment on July 17, 2025. You can use it with the game to unlock Pauline's Diva Dress. $40 | Releases April 2, 2026 The Super Mario Galaxy 1 + 2 Collection arrived early this year, and early next year, you'll be able to get your hands on a few Galaxy-inspired Amiibo. This includes the Rosalina and Lumas figure, which is up for preorder ahead of its April 2 release. It can be scanned with the games to unlock a 1-Up Mushroom. $40 | Releases April 2, 2025 Also arriving on April 2 of next year is the Mario and Luma Amiibo. It can be scanned with the games to unlock a Life Mushroom. $20 The iconic Donkey Kong villain originally joined the Smash Bros. Amiibo lineup in 2019. After being out of print for years, King K. Rool returned in 2025 as a Best Buy exclusive thanks to the smash hit Donkey Kong Bananza. $30 The Metroid Dread Amiibo series released in October 2021, and this double pack gets you both the Samus and EMMI Amiibo. And if you're having trouble with the challenging game, you can scan the Samus figure for an extra energy tank, while the EMMI Amiibo gets you a Missle+ tank. $16 Based on the Link's Awakening remake for Nintendo Switch, the tiny, cartoonish figure arrived in 2019 and is still available at Best Buy for just $16. $16 Released in 2016, this version of Zelda was inspired by her appearance in The Wind Waker. It can be scanned into a variety of games, including Tears of the Kingdom, where it unlocks an exclusive paraglider fabric plus additional materials and items. $20 While Link and Zelda have seen plenty of Amiibo releases, only two versions of Ganondorf exist. This version was launched in 2023 as part of the Tears of the Kingdom series, and it's available at Best Buy for $20. It's typically offered for $30 when purchased directly from Nintendo. $16 If the Kirby Air Riders series feels a bit too expensive, you can instead check out this old Amiibo from 2016. Featuring Kirby traveling on a Warp Star, it's just $16 at Best Buy right now. $16 Byleth is the star of Fire Emblem: Three Houses (which launched in 2019), but their Amiibo is actually part of the Super Smash Bros series. Released in 2021, it's compatible with Fire Emblem Engage, Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes, and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. $16 Released way back in 2015, you'll find this classic Amiibo at Best Buy for just $16. It's part of the Super Mario series, can be scanned into dozens of games, and features the mustachioed plumber striking one of his most iconic poses. $16 This version of Bowser launched alongside the Mario figure in 2015. He too can be scanned into dozens of games (including Super Mario Galaxy and Galaxy 2), and his large design makes him stand out among other, smaller Amiibo. $16 Released in 2017 and sporting his wedding attire, this quirky Amiibo is available for just $16 at Best Buy. It's part of the Super Mario Odyssey Amiibo series, which includes both Peach and Bowser. $16 Decked out in what have to be the nicest clothes in his wardrobe, Bowser looked pretty spiffy when this Amiibo arrived in 2017. Like others in this collection, it's compatible with a bunch of games--including Super Smash Bros Ultimate and Super Mario Odyssey. $16 Rounding out the wedding party is none other than Peach herself. Launched in 2017, you'll find the old, iconic Amiibo for $16 right now--though it'll likely sell out fast. $16 If the Wedding Outfit Amiibo seems a bit too flashy, you can pick up the Peach figure that's part of the Super Smash Bros series. It's even older than the Wedding Outfit figure, as it launched way back in 2014. $16 Another good option is Peach from the standard Super Mario series. This depicts Peach with her classic attire, and it's arguably the best Amiibo of the bunch. It was originally released in 2015. $16 Unlike Peach, Daisy has only been given the Amiibo treatment twice. This one is part of the Super Smash Bros series and originally launched in 2019. $16 As the iconic, eternal enemy of Mario, the lowly Goomba is both evil and adorable. The same is true of this Amiibo, which is part of the Super Mario series and first released in 2017. $16 Not one to leave their Goomba friends behind, the equally adorable Koopa Amiibo was released in 2017. It's part of the Super Mario series and is a popular collector's item. $16 Kingdom Hearts may have started as a PlayStation exclusive, but it found its way to Nintendo with the 2004 release, Chain of Memories. Sora then made the cut for Super Smash Bros Ultimate, and he became an Amiibo in 2024. $25 The Pearl and Marina Amiibo figures were released in 2018, though they remain popular to this day thanks to the launch of Splatoon 3 in 2022. $16 The lovable sidekick of Splatoon 3, Smallfry was immortalized as an Amiibo a few months after the game release in 2022. The figure looks adorable, with Smallfry just as emotive as they are in the game. $16 Another launch that followed hot on the heels of Splatoon 3. The colorful Octoling is available for $16 at Best Buy, and it unlocks exclusive gear in Splatoon 3 and is compatible with several other games. $30 Though most fans are probably holding out for a Chicken Jockey Amiibo, for now you can make do with the Steve and Alex double pack. These released as part of the Super Smash Bros collection in 2022.
