Title: It looks like Meta just hit a big AI roadblock

Meta (META-2.36%) reportedly has delayed the release of its latest artificial intelligence model, known internally as “Behemoth,” raising concerns among employees about the effectiveness and direction of the company’s massive AI investments. Engineers have struggled to improve the large-language model’s performance compared to earlier versions in the Llama model family, The Wall Street Journal (NWSA-0.90%) reports. This has prompted internal debate about whether the upgrade is substantial enough to merit public release, sources told the Journal. Shares in Meta were down more than 2% by Thursday’s close. Initially set for an April debut during Meta’s first AI developer conference, Behemoth’s launch was pushed to June and potentially has been postponed until at least the fall. When Meta released two smaller Llama models in April, the company was praised for the speed with which it has caught up with rivals when it comes to developing its own generative AI tools. The company now faces increasing pressure to demonstrate meaningful progress with Behemoth and signal to Wall Street it can follow through with a return-on-investment. Meta has spent billions on AI development, with plans for up to $65 billion in capital expenditures this year. Its stock price to earnings ratio is 25.05, as of May 15, meaning investors are paying $25.05 for every $1 of earnings. Though Meta has publicly claimed Behemoth outperforms competing models such as OpenAI, Google (GOOGL-1.57%), and Anthropic in some benchmarks, internal sources told the Journal that the model is facing significant training challenges, and its real-world performance may not live up to the company’s public claims. Meta’s AI journey began with its Fundamental AI Research Team, which developed the original Llama models in early 2023. However, 11 of the 14 authors of the initial Llama paper have since left the company, and newer versions are being built by a different team. Controversy also arose in April when it was revealed that the model Meta submitted to a widely used AI chatbot leaderboard was not the same version released to the public. Meta later admitted it had optimized the submitted model specifically for the benchmark. Meta is not alone in facing delays, however. OpenAI’s next major model, GPT-5, has also been postponed, with the company instead rolling out an intermediate version called GPT-4.5. Anthropic has likewise delayed the release of Claude 3.5 Opus, a larger and more powerful AI model, though it said the release is imminent.

'삼성·LG'가 OS 굴기에 나섰으나 두 기업 '사이'상 협업이 될 리가 없었고 삼성은 타이젠에 실패해 초저가폰, 가전기기, 웨어러블 쓰고 있으며 LG는 시장에서 퇴출된 HP로부터 웹OS를 인수하여 '활용' 중입니다. 휴대폰 제국 노키아가 망할 줄 누가 알았고 '모토로라'가 망할 줄 누가 알았을까요? 모바일 시장에서 시장에서 도태된 수많은 기업들 중 하나였던 모토로라는 구글에 매각된 후 모듈폰 '프로젝트 아라' 실패 후 '레노버'에 매각을 했습니다.

'애플'은 SW와 HW를 판매하는 기업이라 OS 최적화에 이점이 있던 반면에 삼성전자는 구글에서 레퍼런스폰과 함께 새 OS를 출시하면 라이선스를 획득해서 커스텀 OS에 HW를 맞춰야 했습니다. HW 스펙을 올리면 소위 광탈이라 불렸던 배터리 사용량이 늘어날 수 밖에 없었고 삼성전자는 이 문제를 심플하게 해결했는데 배터리 크기를 키웠습니다. 설계 공간을 확보하면 발열(통풍) 처리가 유리하고 디스플레이 크기만큼 배터리 셀을 채워 넣을 수 있습니다.

'트럼프'가 하한선 10%라는 상호관세는 가격 경쟁력에 포함됩니다. '트럼프'가 미국을 다시 위대하게 제조업 국가로 만들겠다는 그 트럼프노믹스를 버티지 못하는 미국 IT 업계 중 일부는 반드시 모토로라와 IBM의 전철을 밟게 될 것입니다. Giorgia Meloni’s government wants to ease the burden on middle-class earnings with another giveaway in the coming year https://t.co/78EacApzXf The European Union must revamp its alliance with the UK, French President Emmanuel Macron says at the JPMorgan Global Markets Conference in Paris https://t.co/Bzmiv9SRY5 European Central Bank Vice President Luis de Guindos cautioned that the recent trade turmoil could still upend the region’s financial system https://t.co/l3cVadUmnT 부익부 빈익빈이 중세 시대에는 없었나고 고대 로마 시대에는 없었고 근대 민주주의가 탄생한 프랑스 '시민 혁명' 때는 없었냐? 그렇지 않습니다. 그럼에도 역사가 반복되는 이유는, 산수를 해보면 자본 피라미드 구조상 밑변이 넓기 때문입니다. 2개의 전쟁으로 밑변이 더 넓어 졌으니까 '트럼프'가 복귀를 할 수 있었던 것입니다. 경제 뉴스에서 중산층이 지갑을 닫고 자영업·소상공인들이 자식 학원비도 못 내다가 카드론 쓰고 손 붙잡고 죽는다고 말하죠. 청년들의 취업률이 감소하니까 중산층에 진입하지 못하고 밑변에 포함됩니다.

'국정농단'(공천개입)에 분열이 나서 '옥새파동'이 터져 '조선일보'와 '보수'가 탄핵 시킨 게 박근혜 전 대통령이었으며 더불어민주당은 오히려 역풍 우려에 탄핵에 소극적이었습니다. '세월호' 사태가 터지자 '박근혜' 즉시 '탄핵'을 주창했던 게 더불어민주당 '비주류'였던 '필승재명' 씨였습니다. “It will not be a steep step up, but a gradual one”Siemens CEO Roland Busch says China is "picking up momentum" in the automotive industry https://t.co/nn5VerOPr9 pic.twitter.com/0988G10e4G Beijing has pushed back against a US decision aimed at curbing Chinese-made artificial intelligence chips, a first sign of discord between the world’s two largest economies since they agreed to a trade truce last weekend. https://t.co/siYx8bEIv7 Trump's trade war has spared an industry Europe dominates: hearing aids.

J.D 밴스가 됐건 루비오 국무장관이 됐건 척 슈머는 공화당에 호재입니다. 여기에 카말라 해리스까지 트페미로 설처대면 민주당은 국민의힘보다 훨씬 심각하게 아사리판이 나는 수가 있습니다.

Title: What’s Happening With CoreWeave Stock?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/05/15/whats-happening-with-coreweave-stock/

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. A laptop keyboard and CoreWeave logo displayed on a phone screen are seen in this illustration photo ... More taken in Krakow, Poland on March 28, 2025. (Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) CoreWeave (NASDAQ: CRWV), an AI infrastructure provider, recently announced its Q1 results, reporting a loss of $1.49 per share on revenue of $982 million. This exceeded market expectations of $853 million in revenue. However, its capital expenditures plan of $20-23 billion was much higher than the $18 billion anticipated by the analysts and it didn’t sit well with investors - triggering a decline in the stock in after-hours trading. Separately, see – Is UNH Stock Now A Falling Knife? Since its IPO at $40 per share in March, CRWV stock has surged past $65 earlier this week, significantly outperforming the NASDAQ index’s 11% gain over the same period. CoreWeave’s strong backlog of over $25 billion has contributed to its stock’s impressive performance. However, if you prefer a less volatile investment alternative, consider the High Quality Portfolio, which has consistently outpaced the S&P 500 and has delivered over 91% returns since inception. CoreWeave’s Q1 revenue of $982 million reflects an impressive 420% year-over-year increase. CoreWeave has secured significant contracts with leading AI labs, hyperscalers, and enterprises, including OpenAI, Microsoft, IBM, Meta, and Mistral AI, aiding its revenue growth. The first quarter also saw OpenAI solidify its relationship with CoreWeave by committing to a five-year deal worth up to $11.9 billion. This significant agreement underscores the growing importance of CoreWeave’s infrastructure for OpenAI. Additionally, CoreWeave’s adjusted EBITDA margin increased by 700 bps to 62%, up from 55% in the previous year’s quarter. However, the adjusted net loss widened to $150 million from $24 million in the prior-year quarter. Higher revenue offset by a contraction in net margin resulted in adjusted net loss of $0.61 per share. Looking ahead, CoreWeave expects Q2’25 revenue of $1.08 billion and full-year 2025 revenue of $5.0 billion, at the mid-point of the provided range. This fares better than the consensus estimates of $987 million and $4.6 billion, respectively. CRWV stock has shown some volatility since its debut. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, which consists of 30 stocks, is significantly more stable. It has also comfortably outperformed the S&P 500 over the past four years. Why? This portfolio comprises stocks that have historically provided stronger returns with lower risk compared to the broader index, offering a more predictable performance, as evident in the HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current economic uncertainty surrounding tariffs and ongoing trade disputes, could CoreWeave sustain its upward trajectory? Since the stock was only listed last year, there is no historical data to assess its historical valuation multiple. At its current price of approximately $63 (after market hours), CRWV trades at 13 times trailing revenue. With sales increasing by over 700% in 2024, over 400% in Q1, and it’s expected to grow 2.3x this year, the company’s high valuation multiple appears justified. However, the company’s high capital expenditures and widening losses remain key near-term concerns.

Title: Many Market Opportunities To Come As Tariff Debacle Concludes, According to Fundstrat’s Tom Lee – Here’s His Outlook

Fundstrat’s Tom Lee sees a lot of opportunity in the stock market this year. In a new interview with CNBC, Lee argues that US businesses have demonstrated resiliency in the face of the pandemic, rate hikes and now tariffs. “Right now, the 10-Year yield at 4% I think isn’t a huge burden, not only for the government, but also for the economy or for companies, so I think it’s a level of funding that businesses can earn a return on capital, and then as we think about 2026, there’s a lot to be excited about, we have deregulation coming, we have the tariff debacle behind us, we have tax cuts possibly, and then we might have better trade partnerships with other countries, meaning US companies have earnings upside. I think that the market is flat year-to-date through May, so I don’t think anyone should feel like they missed anything. I think that they’re going to have a chance to buy a lot of companies – a lot of stocks got obliterated, and I think that these washed-out names are still opportunities. We talk about it with our clients, whether it’s Tesla, or the MAG-7 (Magnificent 7), or the small-caps, there are many opportunities still.” The Magnificent Seven stocks include shares of the tech giants Tesla, Meta, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Nvidia.

Title: At This $5 Billion Ohio Advisory, Financial Planning Comes With A Wall Of Touch Screens And A Dose Of AI
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2025/05/14/at-this-5-billion-ohio-advisory-financial-planning-comes-with-a-wall-of-touch-screens-and-a-dose-of-ai/
Time Published: 2025-05-14T11:30:00Z
Full Content:
BySergei Klebnikov BySergei Klebnikov, Forbes Staff. CEO Craig Findley works in the Venture Lab. Walking into Venture Visionary Partners’ gleaming Sylvania, Ohio headquarters just outside of Toledo feels less like entering a wealth management firm and more like stepping into the lobby of a Silicon Valley innovator. A serene waterfall greets you at the door; sleek glass offices line the halls, while oversized digital screens pulse with real-time data and market updates. But the real centerpiece—and increasingly a beating heart of the operation—is tucked beyond the conference rooms up on the second floor: the Venture Visionary Lab. A brainchild of founder and CEO Craig Findley, the high tech control room is an unusual setting for a wealth management industry steeped in virtues like patience and measured growth. “It’s like having a second brain in the room,” argues Findley with a smile, gesturing to the space where every wall is a floor-to-ceiling touch screen. Essentially a war room meant to resemble a mini New York Stock Exchange, it combines institutional-grade investment research with Venture’s proprietary tools—and a heavy dose of cutting-edge AI, powered by OpenAI. The Lab is both an R&D center and an expensive client marketing tool used to impress its mostly midwestern clientele. "It helps clients see that we take this seriously," says Findley, 55, a finance and marketing major who graduated from Michigan’s Hillsdale College, a small, Christian, liberal arts school, in 1992. And for clients who love tech? "They’re frankly blown away." Originally envisioned as a trading, research and collaboration hub, the Lab has evolved into something much more ambitious. The room’s four walls are giant, interactive planar screens, connected to laptops through a simple barcode device. Facial recognition is required for entry, and a virtual AI assistant—cheerily nicknamed "Venture"—is ready to take notes, pull up investment research, or even recall a client’s last conversation at a moment's notice. Soon, Findley hopes, the Lab will be fully voice interactive. "Eventually, it will greet us—and clients—when we walk in," he says. Today, it's already partially there: Ask Venture about a company or client, and within seconds it retrieves curated information drawn from its approved research sources and CRM system. Founded in 2019, the $5.1 billion (assets under management) registered investment advisory firm prides itself on building deep, personalized relationships with clients, but now technology has supercharged that approach. All that high technology is not free. Findley figures his outfitting Venture Visionary Lab cost him no less than $500,000 to complete. In terms of fees, his firm traditionally charges 1% to 1.5% of assets, according to its SEC filings. One of the keys to Findley’s approach is the quality of his data inputs. New clients fill out a 62-question personality and values assessment, probing everything from relationship priorities to legacy goals. Questions vary from seemingly trivial matters about whether a client has hired a lawyer or made up a will to to more in-depth enquiries such as the core values that guide their work and personal lives. Once complete, a client’s answers are reflected back to them across the Lab’s vast digital screen in a personalized “mind map.” While this discovery process isn’t new for Venture, displaying these answers for clients in the Lab over recent months has not only made it a more interactive process but also more efficient, where Findley and his team can better identify client priorities. “It allows us to better get in the weeds during the discovery process,” he adds. The Lab doesn’t just wow clients—it helps Venture's advisors work smarter with its AI capturing meeting notes and assigns follow ups. If a client mentioned their daughter’s college acceptance during a meeting six months ago? Venture will remember—and suggest a timely congratulatory follow-up at the next touchpoint. Investment committee meetings take place inside the Venture lab. The Lab also plays a helpful role in Venture Visionary Partners’ process as a tool during investment committee meetings. Say Findley and his team are looking at Tesla stock for instance. The AI assistant can quickly pull up summarized analyst reports, financial documents and earnings calls for review, helping the firm spot patterns faster when it comes to portfolio management. They have also begun leveraging Boosted.ai’s Alfa chatbot to improve the efficiency and accuracy of market research. For instance, the team recently prompted Alfa to analyze Russell 1000 companies that reported earnings over the past three months and identify those that beat both EPS and revenue estimates. “We then paired that data with Seeking Alpha’s Earnings Revision Scores to highlight ‘triple beat’ companies—those that not only exceeded earnings and revenue expectations but also raised forward guidance,” says Findley. The firm’s flagship strategy is rising dividend stocks, primarily focusing on U.S. large-cap companies. For more aggressive investors, Venture offers a growth-at-a-reasonable-price strategy that seeks to capture long-term capital appreciation without chasing overheated momentum stocks. For opportunities that don’t neatly fit either profile, the firm runs an opportunistic strategy, giving the investment team flexibility to pursue compelling outliers. Some of the team’s top stock picks from these strategies include tech giants Meta and Amazon, which are trading at lower price to earnings multiples than slow-growth consumer staples like Coke and lower than top retailers Walmart and Costco, respectively. Findley also likes brokerage app Robinhood, which he says was undervalued after the market drop in April and should continue to perform well thanks to rapid earnings growth. Another top stock pick is Morgan Stanley, which could see robust growth on the back of increased corporate dealmaking and rising markets. “The stock is still 11% below the February high and trades at a fairly reasonable 14 times earnings,” says Findley. Venture also offers an ETF-based strategy that balances passive investing with tactical tilts toward sectors like technology and communications. On the fixed income side, the firm is content to take advantage of higher near-term yields by investing in government bonds, structured notes, and private credit opportunities. “We try to take the emotions out of investing," Findley says. "Clients get so caught up in politics or short-term news. History—and a visual—is worth a thousand words.” That discipline has been particularly important in recent months, as a barrage of headlines relating to Trump administration policies have whipsawed markets. Though major indexes like the S&P 500 tanked more than 10% following Trump’s initial tariff announcements in early April, the market has since leveled out and is now once again positive for the year. “Tariff policy, although well intended, caused considerable uncertainty,” says Findley. When asked about the future, Findley’s has a clear vision: Even more integration and automation for the client experience and decision-making process—but always with a human touch. “I want a client to walk into the Lab, have it recognize them by face, greet them personally, recall their last visit, and pull up everything we need without lifting a finger,” he says. But will Findley’s expensive AI-fueled rocketship also help create higher returns for Venture Visionary’s clients? The jury is still out.

Pull the military out and send those prisoners to a supermax prison in the US. Yes, they will then be entitled to full rights to defend themselves in American courts but we all have to make sacrifices. That leaves you with 45 square miles (117 km2) of land and water on the shore of Guantánamo Bay. So then you take a page out of Trump’s playbook and turn it into a luxurious resort for the rich and wealthy. You can have high-priced hotels, casinos, knocking shops, restaurants and shopping arcades. If you told Trump that a prime block of land would be set aside for a Trump hotel, he would totally buy into the whole project. Workers you ask? Put in contracts for Cuban workers and buy produce from them to keep the Cubans onside and not to stir up trouble. It’s either that or follow that tech bro plan which would be nothing more that a money pit – with them the major beneficiaries. Much better than the status quo, so why not give it a try? Trump says he will order removal of all US sanctions on Syria Anadolu Agency Trump signs ‘largest arms deal in history,’ secures $600bn Saudi investment pledge The Cradle The insane, demagogic incoherence of Trump and the Trump administration keeps everyone guessing. A scam for all seasons. https://t.co/hgHr4TlauL I completely disagree with all commentators currently claiming a “break” in US/Israeli relations or speaking about a mood shift or Trump breaking with Netenyahu. You are only confused here if you accept such claims as valid. Trump is not lifting all Syrian sanctions for nothing, and we are certainly not speaking about mineral rights or any other such nonsense here. The genocide is still on, Netenyahu is still open about it, and I would bet my last cent that the concessions extracted from this deal are that Syria will take in Gazan refugees. I think this is primary purpose of Trump’s entire trip, to carry on the very same Israeli and State Department policy that was formulated in October/November of 2023. Every manner of PR and bullshit media flak has been thrown up around this but the plan has carried on regardless for 19 months now. I see no reason to think Trump’s tour is not simply a repeat of Bliken’s efforts in 2023 and 2024 to find somewhere to dump the still living Gazans. Whether the rest of the Arab states have agreed to the displacement, I don’t know. But I for one am certain that the cutout Jolani has agreed to facilitate the ethnic cleansing of Gaza(His trip to meet Macron has convinced me). I am surprised so many commentators have forgotten about this entire angle. Pipeline gas from Qatar to Europe, via Saudi, Jordan and Syria? Taiwan is playing with darkness by abandoning nuclear power Intellinews The article flies over a few facts, making it seem that its the current government that has abandoned nuclear power – in reality, that decision was made 20 years or more when a number of plants under construction were mothballed – partially because they didn’t make much economic sense at the time, and partially under intense US pressure over its nuclear weapons program. The one remaining nuclear power plant, at Maanshan (a very nice surf spot as it happens) is more than 40 years old and would cost a fortune to keep running. Its contribution to overall Taiwanese energy use is pretty small. You can certainly argue that it was a serious mistake by Taiwan to opt for coal and gas instead of nuclear for its electricity, but that decision was made decades ago and would take further decades (and many billions of dollars) to reverse. Extending the operating licence for Maanshan would make very little difference. A much better bet for Taiwan would be investing in geothermal energy – the entire country is a major geothermal hotspot. What about a cable connection to the mainland? LOL A quick google search on Taiwan using geothermal came up with this “the island is very densely populated, and operational space is limited in many areas. In contrast, the less densely populated areas are very mountainous, which does not make a strong case for installing a rig either.” It goes on to be much more positive. United Airlines flight attendants stage a protest at the PR event launching a new business class seat. No contract in 5 years, lowest pay of major US airlines. Interesting to note that the 3 gulf carriers pay more than the US. @xJonNYC The FAs have their say at today’s UA new Polaris event They got arrested for trespassing. Hope they aren’t sent to El Salvador. >>>Boosting ICE budgets is bipartisan Polygraph I know that this view will be unpopular with the vast majority of the peeps… If you don’t like a law (eg, migration), repeal it. Selective enforcement is corrosive to society/govt legitimacy long-term. This term, your side doesn’t enforce migration laws. Next term, the other side stops enforcing environmental laws. “Ask for forgiveness (or look the other way), don’t ask for permission” (at all levels of society) is one of the 100 things destroying America’s social fabric. Be that as it may, the article in question is about the ICE BUDGET and the fact that it’s steady increases have been supported by both parties, regardless of who’s in power. So on THIS issue, the precise point is that “your side” and “their side” are the same, and that the alternation between parties makes no difference. I find the “Mission Creep” of ICE disturbing since all of us whose ancestors were not born here more than say, 500 years ago, are immigrants or the descendants of immigrants. With some not especially creative “lawyering” this extends the jurisdiction of ICE, shall we say, rather broadly. Would that be a feature or a bug? Also note, the border czar … I believe that is his moniker … Homan was quoted, when challenged about some of his actions, “I was only following orders.” That defense was definitively shot down during the Nuremberg Trials in 1946. I actually remember that, young though I was. Now you can question the Nuremberg trials and opn some grounds, I do. You can wonder why the borders have been wide open until you look at who hires and benefits from all that inexpensive labor. You can, as I did at the time, see the Patriot Act as among the worst of bad laws, and I do. Why you might ask? Did 17 or 27 …however many “intelligence” agencies there are … need another layer of bureaucracy troweled on top of them? I think not. Was the creation of national police forces … think ICE and others … never stop with just one … necessary? Depends on what plans, hopes, dreams, schemes, you have for them. As to your general points, could not agree more. What once was a government has become a shambles. Shambles: among whose definitions are disorder, ruin, clutter jumble and mess and finally a place of bloodshed or carnage. The OED would note it once referred to a slaughterhouse. (Apologies for the pedantic aside) The absence of long term planning or of follow through in the face of partisan one-up-man-ship, dueling lobbyists, and showers of “campaign contributions” in pursuit of access has reduced the DC Bubble and Echo Chamber to sound and silliness in pursuit of perpetuity in office by the unambitious and perpetuity in office and a small to medium fortune for the more bright eyed. But my cynicism overflows or is it realism? The result is visible this day as The Don as styled by Gay Talese in The Godfather, cavorts about the Arab states being showered with cash in one form or another ostensibly for public purposes, while his offspring and other relations hustle for the various family businesses. In the world of William Gibson’s The Peripheral this is called a Klept … you can look it up. Realism? Cynicism? Folly? Fantasy? Take you choice, but keep an eye on ICE. It’s not that your view is unpopular exactly it’s that it derives from what I believe is nostalgic unreality. Selective enforcement is the very nature of law in this country, has long been, and will ever be. The facade of rule of law has in my view largely been sundered not by the actual cavalier character of government (again, it was ever thus, sovereign is he who decides on the state of exception) but rather by the incredible diversity of media coverage possible in the 21st century which allows the sufficiently politically conscious to view every conceivable angle of policy and identify hypocrisies and inconsistencies at a level of granularity previously reserved for dedicated scholars. Indeed even the comparatively politically narcoleptic now live in such demographically stratified infospaces that it’s perfectly impossible not to perceive the comparative lawlessness of their political opposite. We once – before my lifetime so I take this as an article of faith – had a monoculture in news media that was capable of weaving a coherent throughline between any number of acts of brazen extralegal fiat such that the American public could digest it all. That is certainly not the case now and I cannot conceive of it ever being so again. Indeed, selective law enforcement is a common feature of all unfree societies where a few people rule over everyone else and forbid people from upholding their own laws. In free societies, everyone is expected to agree on and uphold their own laws and thus there are not exceptions like this. What Ironic is saying is true – it’s better to have societies where everyone agrees on rules that work for everybody. Otherwise people just argue over whose rules and enforcement preferences dominate. And of course the rich usually get their way. great, timely piece by historian Zachary Foster: https://palestinenexus.com/articles/jewish-antizionism It is a good overview, although slanted towards the English-speaking Jewish world in its last section: there is almost nothing about the current attitude of European (or South American) Jews towards zionism. I also found two intriguing articles by the same author on that site: How Zionists Prevented Jewish Refugees From Returning Home After WWII and Was Zionism about Rescuing Jews Fleeing Persecution? No. A further article confirms my earlier impression that the staunch support of Israel by the likes of Sunak, Meloni, Macron, Biden, Scholz, etc, is not due to any strategic advantage (economic, military, geographic, or otherwise), but because Israel is the country where Western countries, where antisemitism is latent, especially in right-wing circles, can dump their Jewish population. And if this happens to the detriment of Arabs, so what? “US Hypocrisy on Terrorism Reaches New Heights, While Trump Signals a Welcomed Shift in US Foreign Policy” I thought that Larry Johnson would be more stirred up about Trump with meeting Syria’s Jolani. That guy is basically an al-Qaeda leader and until recently had a $10 million bounty on his head by the US government. So I can see it now. Trump enters the room to meet Jolani who comes in with a trimmed beard, polished shoes, an expensive Rolex and a bespoke suit. The cameras are rolling for this historic event. Trump thinks to himself at least this is one leader that does not go around wearing t-shirts. As Jolani gets closer, he rips his jacket open to reveal sticks of dynamite, shouts ‘Allahu Akbar’ before hugging Trump, then BOOM! Can you imagine? US’ side of the Shi’a-Sunni schism! Sunni terrorists, sustained by USA since 1980’s are the good guys. Trump in KSA is renewing US pledge to Arabian peninsula Wahabbi. As long as Sunnis in charge Israel is safe. Sell them new anti missile shield, golden dome for Medina! It’s really not the Sunnis at large but specifically Wahhabi Takfiri fighters funded by the Gulf despots and supported by US/Israeli deep state. They’ve been at it since 1970s Afghanistan, kicked it up a notch in the Balkans and then Chechyna, then Uyghurs, Iraq, Lybia, Syria, etc. Associating these predominantly Muslim murdering freaks with the bulk of Muslims is like associating Christian Zionists in Congress with all Christians. I think that Trump’s speech in Saudi Arabia is perhaps the best I’ve seen give him. To be honest I can’t recall a better speech from a US president. Among items strengths, he’s gracious to the hosts, rather than lecturing them as other Western leaders like Biden or Baerbock would do. He’s acknowledging real strengths in the hosts, which is they built up gleaming cities, that they’re probably proud of themselves. He’s acknowledging real failures at home, the trillions wasted on Baghdad on Kabul and nation building there. Those cities would be better off without US nation building. And finally it reflects real recent policy changes. They’re lifting the idiotic sanctions on Syria and they ended the idiotic attacks on Yemen. Honestly, I think a large percentage of the influence is how well they dress. And they let him touch the orb. He really enjoyed that! Agreed on the speech, but let’s see where he goes with it. On Syria, give a leg up to US’ “refined” terrorists. If IDF can kill Gazans new Syrian allies can kill non SUnni. Keeping in mind that Obama received a Nobel Peace Prize (2009) for making speeches and without making positive actions toward peace, I would say that Trump was following in Obama’s footsteps, considering one of Trump’s goals is receiving a Nobel. I’m afraid that starting a trade war with China, bombing civilians in Yemen, threatening Iran with a full-fledged attack, helping Israel commit a genocide in Gaza and keeping the war in the Ukraine going is not going to get him that Nobel peace prize. Not even if he regifts the Qatari jet to the Nobel committee? As proven by how they gave a Nobel to Obama before he even did anything, they are a cheap date. If I recall correctly, he did bomb the Moon. Perhaps we should encourage Trump to take still more bribes from the Arab countries if it means a correction of the long standing and senseless policy of favoring the 9 1/2 million Jewish Israelis over the triple digit millions who surround them. After all there has long been plenty of campaign bribery going on to further the anti Arab cause. In his recent talk with Judge Nap Alastair Crooke points out that the Cold War excuse for our ME policy was to keep the Soviets out of the Middle East. But the Cold War–mostly also senseless–is over despite neocons trying to revive it. FDR favored the Arabs while still asking them to accept Zionism. Truman on the other hand defied the advice of his State Department by siding with Israel. This policy mistake engendered all that has followed. At this point Israel isn’t going anywhere but for their own good someone needs to introduce them to reality. > he’s gracious to the hosts Because he wants $40 oil. Trump is a salesman. > lifting the idiotic sanctions on Syria Abu Mohammed al-Jolani was a most wanted terrorist a few month ago. Now that he is in charge, so no more sanctions. Trump is no different, he is just doing “it” differently. The Don was being polite for a change, but he respects wealth and glitter, besides it costs nothing. In this case one can quote the nameless person who said of a political speech, “He talks purty, don’t he.” Obama rode “talkin’ purty” to the presidency then betrayed all, almost all(?) of his promises right out the gate. The Don wants a Nobel Peace prize because Obama received one and, i am convinced,The Don has never forgiven Obama for mocking him at the Press Club(?) dinner in DC in 2011. Vengeful persons neither forget nor forgive. Take this however you will. Churchill is quoted as saying, “When you are going to kill a man, it costs nothing to be polite.” It is irritating to praise Trump for something like this but you’re not wrong if just regarding the content of the speech itself. Actually, more than irritating, it’s mortifying that this level of graciousness – what I would describe as completely reasonable and expected etiquette when one is a guest – is something laudable in the Western context. We’re grading on a frankly embarrassing curve. Trump’s speech suggested to me that the last person he spoke with before getting off the plane was Tulsi Gabbard. If so, good for both of them. I found this to be an interesting thread dissecting what Trump was banging on about … between Arnaud Bertrand and below commenter. Amine Idriss @amibiaka · 19h Arnaud, I see what you’re pointing to — but let’s not kid ourselves. Trump’s speech isn’t a breakthrough in appreciating civilizational diversity. It’s a classic expression of his white nationalist worldview, dressed up as respect for sovereignty. https://x.com/RnaudBertrand/status/1922443275526668625 Arnaud’s core argument is – “Regarding Trump’s speech in Saudi, some see it as a refreshing break from liberal hypocrisy. I see it as something more dangerous, the normalization of a neo-mercantilist worldview. And that’s not a nostalgic return to realism; it’s a revival of the very ideology that once justified conquest, colonization, and the commodification of entire peoples. People in the West today complain about migration, as if it’s an invasion. But most of those who migrate to the West are fleeing the long-term consequences of Western imperialism, of resource extraction, of wars fought for oil or influence, of economic systems designed to benefit a few and impoverish the many. This doesn’t mean illegal immigration should be glorified. But let’s be honest: I have no sympathy for anti-immigrant rhetoric when it comes from the descendants of those who directly benefited from colonial plunder and racial capitalism.” – snip It seems to me that multipolarity is not unlike a global shit in the magnetic field, fluxes, and then bang it changes. How networks of power position themselves for it, with a side of climate change, is a sight to behold, as such I highly discount anything coming from Anglophone camp[see above] and especially anything coming from disingenuous Trump/camp[self serving]. “PM Modi Elaborates on S-400 Missile System’s Importance For India’s Air Defence: Why They Matter Now More Than Ever” How long until the US orders India to get rid of those S-400s because it is against US law for them to own them. And then to tell India to buy inferior Patriot batteries instead – which don’t exist at the moment – and to buy hundreds if not thousands of Patriot battery missiles – which have not even been manufactured yet. If India is lucky, they should get those Patriot batteries & missiles by 2040. You think that Pakistan will wait? The US doesn’t have that level of control over India. Might change in the future, but India is an important part of trying to contain China and because it has a conflict with China it also has more incentives to maintain relations with Russia. The Turks are much more vulnerable to pressure and have less reasons to keep Russia on side. India already has a domestic Patriot equivalent (medium range, up to around 150km), the Barak 8, which is jointly produced with Israel. Earlier reports indicated that India bought the S-400 specifically for the purposes of providing air defence over its borders with China – hence range and anti-stealth capability is particularly important. The recent possible failures in conflict with Pakistan may result in a rethink about where they are deployed. Mixing two separate systems is not considered good practice in air defence, so its a curious decision – presumably they have fallen behind in producing a Barak with the range to match the S-400. The big question, presumably well pondered by the Russians and Israelis, is how they stop each side getting access to key operational and technical inside information. If the systems can talk to each other – even if it be trough a third system – then it’s fine and dandy. Something akin to not having all your eggs in the same basket. But if the systems are isolated enough to basically fight alone, then they’re out-dated and handicapped even before they go operational. Allegedly Iran can take pretty much any air-defense system and make it work with their command, control, communication & situational awareness (C3/SA) network for air defense. “Illinois governor is first in US to block federal access to personal data on autism” Hey, Pritzker, why not block federal access to all personal data? Fourth amendment, anyone? Or does it apply only to corporate persons now? It’s funny how someone(s) is positioning/astroturfing Pritzker (billionaire, Dem. Machine scion) as a potential “Resistance” leader-2028 contender, see Jimmy Kimmel visit and Pritzker’s name popping up in random WaPo-NYt mentions. With friends like elite Democrats, who needs Republicans?! Pritzker, Slotkin and Buttigieg! Who says Ds don’t have a bench? (With JB, it had better be a sturdy one unless his consultants put him on Ozempic) Well, if the DemParty were to have a genuine democratic free Republican-quality primary for the first time in many years, we could see what shakes out. Or even get a vote on what shakes out. If . . . . No more down that path for me. I’m a veteran of McGovern in a small way, and recall how the Democrat Party not just abandoned a candidate, but actively allied against him. “Geonomics, nationalism and trade” This is why I decry the entire project to manufacture a divorce in the original term “political economy” into supposed “sciences” of each, an achievement of the unholy alliance of the marginalist school (Alfred Marshall being the foremost cementer of the ideas of Jevons, Menger and Walras) in economics and their Gilded Age funders in banking. It’s harmless enough in microeconomics, but intellectually lethal in macroeconomics — because in the latter “the politics never really went away.” It’s also why wherever international business investment went, gunboats inevitably followed … 🤨 “Qatar’s $400M jet for Trump is a gold-plated security nightmare” It doesn’t have to be. Trump could lease that 747 Jumbo jet back from the US government for a dollar a month while the government picks up the tab for the running expenses. He then announces that all those that own one of his Trump meme coins can go into a lottery to get a flight aboard this Jumbo jet for an hour or two. People would go out and buy & register one like they would with lottery tickets, especially MAGA supporters. Those that win would pay a $50 fee but that would be seen as cheap for a Trump flight and there would be no security issues at all. And is this so different to when recently top buyers of his coin could get a dinner with him? https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/12/top-buyers-trump-cryptocurrency-dinner It’s kind of amusing how even given Trump’s famously lax definition of ‘national security threats’ (the opioid crisis, illegal immigration, countries running a trade surplus with the US, the continued existence of Canada/Greenland as independent nations…) a Presidential plane supplied by a foreign power somehow doesn’t make the list. If you get behind on your payments on your Tesla, they can auto- drive your car back to the dealership. Makes me speculate that if Tesla can do that – then they could auto-drive your car off a cliff or into a pole if you don’t agree with Musk politics…..just speculating ya know – maybe a fun little sci-fi – a little data integration with siri, doorbells and all sorts of smart devices combined along with digital currency and Homeland security and police fusion centers…… why you could deport anybody you want with a self driving cab or car instead of iconviniencing ICE and the courts….you could knock off any opposition and disapear people at will….erase their identity and digital footprint or frame someone easy-peasy………..who needs to mess with that constitution or laws etc. Sounds about rite for the duopoly’s vision for Making America Great Again and Defending democracy…… I just wish they would tell me for whom they are defending democracy for and, for whom are they making America great Brings to mind the death of Michael Hastings, the journalist who got General Stanley McChrystal fired. During the morning’s brief channel surfing, I came across Andrew Ross Sorkin and Becky Quick lamenting the decline of ethics over the past couple of decades. For answers, they turned with all seriousness to their guest, Stanley McChrystal. Don’t change before the Empire falls. You’ll laugh so hard, you’ll crack the walls. Sometimes, I just miss the days when satire was a thing and not reality. Yes, I’ve kind of come to the conclusion that it woulnt matter whether Trump or some other clown was in the White House, we really are screwed. Trump just showed us the true nature of things. These tech billionaires own us and there is really nothing that can be done about it. Any of these jack asses, could set anyone up for a fall. And frankly with very little effort or evidence. And just who is gonna do anything About it? Anyone that thinks the courts or the press or the political class will help is deluded. Trump will have his plane, the USPS will be privatized, Social Security and medicare too. It’s all gone, along with our so called democracy. It done. That picture from Saudi Arabia was our future. Along with the list of billionaires. They own it and there nothing we can do about it. The democracy they are defending is the facade for what making America great again means. Simply great and democratic for them, not us. RE: “…they could auto-drive your car off a cliff or into a pole if you don’t agree with [insert elite name here] politics…” Very true! And you might enjoy the Terra Ignota scifi series where self-flying cars are a major plot point. Excerpt from the wiki entry – “The Six-Hive Transport System is a global network of flying cars, the primary mode of transportation in the series. They are fast enough to circle the globe in less than 4.2 hours, made possible by Cartesian set-sets. Mukta was the prototype car made in 2073 and now resides in the Saneer-Weeksbooth home. Utopia [a political faction] operates its own car system, separate to the primary one used in the series. The Utopian system is slightly slower than the primary one, but has 100% fewer accidents.” You will have to read the series (or at least the first two books which are great – the latter two are subpar) to find out why one political faction refuses to use the global transportation system. Suffice it to say that after reading the series, I will never be getting into any driverless car. Cars themselves will drive to the police station on detecting a non-white person in the driver’s seat? Regarding Guantanamo being re-purposed as a prison for migrants: Obama, when refusing to pursue criminal investigations against torture and other criminal acts at Guantanamo and elsewhere, said it was time to “look forward, not backward.” We now have a much clearer idea of what he meant. “RFK Jr. is full of crap” Somehow, looking at the images of RFK jr. taking his grandkids to go swim in those polluted waters, I am reminded of that 1975 film “Jaws.” The scene where people were on the beach but were not going into the water because of the recent shark attack. That is, until the local official leans on some older people to go into the water and when they do, they take their very young grandchildren with them into those waters. Don’t know why I thought of that old film… “Trump envoys Witkoff and Kellogg to go to Turkey for Russia-Ukraine talks, sources say” Those talks are going to go nowhere. Zelensky is trying to turn it into a media stunt by daring Putin to go there but what would they talk about? Zelenski’s 10-point peace plan? Kellogg, whose plan Trump has adopted, hopes Putin turns up. Even I know that negotiations don’t work that way and it is only after everything is settled that you call in the leaders to sign the agreements. Trump made himself sound like an idiot by indicting that he might just drop in to any meeting. Everybody knows that Presidents on Air Force One just drop in on random visits to countries from time to time to do a bit of shopping and maybe to pick up a pizza. The only reason why they want Putin there is to give him an ultimatum to freeze the conflict or else. Maybe even do to him what Trump and Vance did to Zelenski in that White House meeting several weeks ago. And Kellogg and others have said that as soon as there is a freeze, that they will flood the Ukraine with troops from at least four NATO nations. Looks like this war is going to be decided on the battlefield as Trump only wants negotiations so that Russia wins the war but loses the peace. And as it is now no longer Biden’s war but Trump’s war, the failure is all going to be on him. And all those neocons like Lindsay Graham will pretend that they were not pushing him but will blame Trump for not trying hard enough and which the media will go along with. I do not recall Witkoff or Kellogg being invited. Why send two persons with opposing views in the first place? Lavrov should, politely, tell them to bugger off. Trump should pull a page from Teddy Roosevelt. Invite Russia and Kiev to come to Portsmouth, NH. June is very nice in New England and the hotel from 1905 has been updated. The space at the shipyard may need polish. Bretton Woods is nice, too. “How Joe Biden Handed the Presidency to Donald Trump” Let us treat this as the New Yorker’s bid for the Most Embarrassing Blame Deflection Award for 2025 (wittier name pending). At the moment the only other candidate is that ludicrous New York Times article which apparently informed us that Russia would’ve been roundly defeated in the special military operation but for the intransigence, incompetence, and possibly incontinence of the Ukrainian military brass; the academy is therefore actively seeking other submissions, as unsealing an envelope for a 50/50 chance isn’t nearly enough fun. When are we going to get the Pulitzer Award for Gaslighting? Or is that the standard Pulitzer nowadays? Oh I hate Donald Trump—-but hold my beer as I do everything in my power to get him re-elected! btw have your beer prices gone up? In my lovely native Bavaria hops harvest has serious shortages due to lack of water. Gooooooood Mooooooooorning Fiatnam! In the fetid QWERTY jungle online where the numismatrix plied its traits, it was all about the skill-ratio, if you could turn a lone greenback into 30 bucks vis a vis crypto, it was a lot better than being stuck with the pyramid scheme on the back of a FRN, and why doesn’t that eagle on the right have a phalanx of old glories behind it, with an artificial breeze fanning them? Regarding the Notes on the Crisis article on “Can China “Buy” America?”: in the 1980s I was tracking mergers and acquisitions as part of a group investigating how dirty money, after being laundered and brought back into the US, was buying up control of established companies. Back then, the major “public” worry was over the Japanese and what they would do with their rapidly growing trade surpluses. But the numbers on dollar amounts of mergers and acquisitions showed a much different reality. By far the largest amount in m&a was by “investors” from Britian and the British empire members of Australia and Canada. The Brits were usually at least three times larger than the Japanese. I was not surprised when legal probes a few years later identified HSBC (then known by its original imperial moniker the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank) as one of the largest launderers of dirty money. HSBC — the infamous Hong Shang — of course, was originally established to process the revenue of the British opium trade out of China. “Plus ça change, plus c’est la même chose,” The UK was a major legitimate investor abroad in the 80’s and the pool of safe countries for FDI.was much smaller. I don’t think the figures were directionally affected by corruption (but BCCI might have been part of it…). In HSBC’s defence, though, their crime was to purchase the extremely dodgy Republic Bank from Edmund Safra, which had a major NYC oresence and apparently zero KYC and AML controls! The US regulator fined them (HSBC) USD 12bn in exchange for a non-admission of guilt plea but in reality they inherited the crimes! Republic under Safra was suspected of tax evasion but also of other illegitimacies, in part because nobody could understand how low margin lending to governments and to physical goods trade could generate the profits claimed, especially when Republic employed very little leverage. The implication is that it was earning a vig on whatever its clients were doing. Given that Safra: – started out in physical shipments of cast. – was a Syrian-Lebanese New – lent to a lot of governments Safra died in a mysterious fire at his Monaco penthouse that was later judged arson…. PS: It is not surprising that fingers were pointed at Iran-contra type deals and drug money, a but like Alan Stanford. Here is an article very lamely pretending these was nothing crooked in public but leaving a trail of breadcrumbs. but it is not hard to read between the lines. https://www.timesofisrael.com/new-biography-probes-into-mysterious-backstory-of-billionaire-banker-edmond-j-safra/ Hunter Biden must be green with envy, the Biden’s only managed to Grift about $23MM total while the Donald’s Family has cleared well over $100MM from crypto alone and if you add the $400MM jet they are averaging better than $125MM a Month. In other happy news regular Gas is at $5.29 per Gallon, cash price at the local 76 station. That’s quite something to be able to gamble on the temperature of a city on a given day, why bother with mundane casinos? Gambling was fairly forbidden a century ago, and now nothing related to gambling is forbidden… heck, a couple of ballplayers who blackened the diamond by one throwing the world series for a gambler, and the other who gambled on games, were reinstated in the MLB yesterday, never mind. Taiwan is playing with darkness by abandoning nuclear power Intellinews The Japanese prefecture of Fukushima is about 5,000 square miles in area, and remains mostly an abandoned area a decade after the reactor meltdown in the prefecture. I assume this will not change for another couple of hundred thousand years. The island of Taiwan is about 13,000 square miles in area, or perhaps two and a half times the size of the Fukushima prefecture. A single reactor catastrophe there on the scale of Fukushima will therefore, to a first approximation, make a half to a third of the island uninhabitable. It’s very easy to see why Taiwan is getting rid of nuclear power as fast as they can, though it doesn’t seem to be as fast as one would like. The mystery is why Japan isn’t doing the same thing. On the other hand, if Taiwan were converted into a nuclear wasteland, China and the US could stop fighting about its future and everyone could relax. I guess there really is a silver lining to every cloud. Fukushima Prefecture was wholly inappropriately abandoned. More people died from moving, upheaval and, in those who stayed, abandonment than could ever die of anthropogenic radiation exposure, especially in an elderly farming population. Sorry if this is a dumb question, was that incident really as dramatic as it was pictured in our (European) media or was it exaggerated or possibly even underplayed. For those curious, I took my avatar name here from the mascot of the Fukushima nuclear plant. For some strange reason they eliminated all reference to him from the internet around about 2011. It’s very hard to get a real grip on the true extent of damage, not least because the Japanese are very good at message control (aided by their ability to keep foreign experts at bay). The extreme radiation was very localised, and thankfully not much went airborne, unlike with Chernobyl. So Revenant is correct to say that the overall direct threat to anyone further than a few miles from the plant was pretty low – but certainly not negligible. But it is still a gigantic ticking bomb which will take many years of control to prevent any kind of chain reaction that could restart a reactor fire, or a major release of radioactivity to the sea (bioconcentration in seafood is ultimately a much bigger human health threat than airborne release). This is one (not the only) reason Taiwan then mothballed its new nuke plants. Taiwan is even more seismically active than Japan and prone to very extreme natural disasters. The scale of the Typhoons that regularly hit the island have to be seen to be believed. It complicates everything. Thanks. I remember that Fukushima was “used” by the Merkel administration to pull off their no-alternatives no-NPPs plan. So we now have basically no leeway in terms of energy production. Back then I argued with colleagues that regarding emissions by various sources it ought to be looked into the matter scientifically. Not ideologically. While that appears a very beginner´s approach for NC I bumped into some heavy resistance. As usual…thinking of the public atmosphere in those days – some even made movies about it… it´s the same insane, unreflected blind trust by the elite in their own media products. Self-serving, self-affirming, circular flow of information. Not much has changed since. Actually I wonder when was the period that this bubble-think became standard and dominant. So that Fukushima could be replaced by any other term. Of course those same circlces don´t even know any more what Fukushima is today. And these are often not bad people. It seriously upsetting Tons and tons of intensely radioactive congealed corium from three reactors is still stuck in the ground below the plants and will continue indefinitely to contaminate ground water. https://dunrenard.wordpress.com/2018/01/28/the-corium-of-reactor-2-of-fukushima-daiichi-is-clearly-visible/ FINALLY! I have been wondering for so many years where PlutoniumKun came from, it sounded Japanese but I wasn’t sure Trump takes a blow torch to the neocons and interventionists while speaking to the Saudis. I am no great admirer of Trump, but I challenge you to find a previous American president who would have said anything remotely similar to what Trump was saying here. Sounds like Noam Chomsky could have written this. Unfortunately, the overall effect was kind of ruined by the fact that on the same trip, he was selling US weaponry out the wazoo. But still… Franklin Delano Roosevelt?! The good neighbour idea? Are the Turks copying Israel with their effort to split PKK? Is Ocalan becoming an Arafat in old age? Are we oing to have a Hamas-PKK and a Fatah/PA-PKK? More like a parliamentary Sinn-Fein-PKK and an extra-parliamentary Provisional-PKK ? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army Six cheetah cubs! I can only think at how many will survive! Heroine mother that one, all by herself… Heroic Mother of the Cheetah Soviet Union, First Class! Although they all look so peeved in that photo, I wonder if they had substantial investments in Tesla or something . . . re: llamas I was mistyping an internet address and ended up with writing “cria” into google. As it turns out that is actually a scientific term derived from the Spanish word for “baby” also describing young specimen of llamas. See Wiki: Etymology The term comes from the Spanish word cría, meaning “baby”. Its false cognate in English, crya (pronounced /ˈkraɪə/), was coined by British sailors who explored Chile in the 18th century and were quick to describe the camelids onomatopoeically according to the mwa sound they made, which was not unlike that of a human crying baby. On the X post “we’ve really decided to let people gamble on the specific temperature…” How do you determine a specific temperature of any town? This seems like a big “So what?” to me. If you check ambientweather.net you’ll see most towns have a pretty wide variance in temps. For example, in the town I live in today right now at 1:00PM, the temperature varies by at least 6F from one side to the other re: US elites instrumentalizing anti-racism JACOBIN The Trouble With Equity By Jennifer C.

Title: Despite A History Of Bribery And Corruption Among Top Shareholders, The World’s Largest Meatpacker Prepares To Go Public

ByChloe Sorvino ByChloe Sorvino, Forbes Staff. The Brother Lode: Billionaires Joesley (left) and Wesley Batista are the top shareholders of JBS, the world's largest meatpacker, which the SEC recently greenlit to be listed on the NYSE. After a decade-long beef with the Securities and Exchange Commission as well as bipartisan opposition in Congress, JBS, the world’s largest meatpacker, was finally given the green light in late April to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The U.S. listing of the Brazil-based JBS has been delayed several times over the past decade due to a deluge of scandals involving the top shareholders and their holding company—including bribes to Brazilian meat inspectors, kickbacks to government financiers and illegal campaign contributions to more than 1,800 Brazilian politicians. That is in addition to accusations in the U.S. of JBS and companies it owns price-fixing, wage-manipulating and violating child labor laws, plus allegations of discrimination and harassment. Joesley and Wesley Batista, 53 and 52 respectively, are the company’s largest shareholders through their holding company J&F Investimentos. The brothers, whom Forbes estimates are worth $4.8 billion each, have also been personally charged with foreign corruption in the U.S. as well as insider trading allegations in Brazil (related to the timing of the news of their bribery scheme) that saw them briefly jailed for about six months from 2017 to 2018. Any one of those issues would have ended most other companies’ prospects of going public on the American market, but following the SEC’s recent decision, JBS is looking to offer shares on the New York Stock Exchange in June, pending a shareholder vote later this month. “This time it looks like it’s for real,” says Carlos Laboy, a managing director who heads up Latin American food coverage including JBS at HSBC, which is not involved in the listing. Over the past two decades, the Batista brothers have turned their family’s South American meat business into a goliath with more than $77 billion in annual revenue with a presence in nearly every country in the world. Its major U.S. brands include Swift, Pilgrim’s Pride, Primo, Blue Ribbon and Certified Angus Beef. But given the mountain of scandals, U.S. politicians from both sides of the aisle have long been opposed to the company going public in America. Just last year, at 15 senators—including Republicans Josh Hawley of Missouri and John Barrasso of Wyoming as well as Democrats Cory Booker of New Jersey, Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts—denounced a potential IPO. For years, former Florida Senator Marco Rubio, now Secretary of State, was one of JBS’ loudest critics. In 2019 Rubio requested an investigation by a Treasury Department committee into JBS’s acquisitions, and in 2021, he renewed the ask and broadened it to the approximately 250 meat and agribusiness companies owned by the Batista family’s holding company J&F Investimentos. The Treasury Department declined to comment. “It probably behooves the U.S. authorities to have JBS listed on the New York Stock Exchange because it increases the regulatory oversight.” But the Batistas’ fortune changed when Donald Trump retuned to the White House in January. The long-delayed SEC approval for JBS’ dual-listing came just two days after it was revealed in a public filing with the federal election commission that the largest donor to the Trump Inaugural Committee was the JBS subsidiary, chicken processor Pilgrim’s Pride. The $5 million donation to Trump’s Inauguration was five times larger than the checks given by Amazon, Meta, Uber, Nvidia and Microsoft, which each gave $1 million. A JBS spokesperson denied any link in the timing of the donation: “No company has control over the timing of when inaugural committee donation contributions are publicized, and the JBS listing has been underway for approximately two years. The company has internal controls and compliance procedures in place to ensure that all political contributions are made in a transparent and ethical manner, and in full compliance with applicable laws and regulations.” The spokesperson also declined to provide the names of executives at the Inauguration, only confirming “several executives attended inaugural events.” The representative declined to comment on whether JBS, Pilgrim’s Pride or any affiliates donated to the Trump Administration’s transition fund from last summer. In addition to the SEC approval, there have been other federal policy changes in President Trump’s first 100 days that have benefited JBS and the Batistas—most notably, the administration’s decision to stop enforcing the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. That law, which dates back to 1977, prohibits U.S. companies (including subsidiaries owned by foreign companies), citizens, as well as foreigners acting in the U.S., from bribing officials in the U.S. or abroad. It had previously led to JBS parent company J&F Investimentos paying a $128 million criminal fine as part of a 2020 settlement with the Department of Justice in which J&F pleaded guilty to corruption charges. J&F also paid nearly $27 million over foreign corruption charges with the SEC in 2020. At the same time, the Batistas, who are Brazilian citizens, settled a civil penalty with the SEC and paid $550,000 each. JBS’ spokesperson says that the Trump Administration’s decision “didn’t change any of the obligations contained in J&F’s settlement, which have been fully complied with.” In terms of linking the SEC’s change of heart about JBS’ listing to donations to Trump’s inaugural, it’s difficult to prove a quid pro quo in court, says Brett Kappel, a campaign finance and government ethics attorney at the Washington, D.C. law firm Harmon Curran, and it’s unlikely a prosecutor would even take the case. “If there were a prosecution, the Justice Department would have to show that there was an agreement that government officials would do certain things in exchange for the contribution,” Kappel says. Although he adds, “the Justice Department could show through circumstantial evidence that the two things were linked. In our judicial system we trust juries to use their common sense to make those decisions." JBS denies any quid pro quo. “As a U.S.-based food company, Pilgrim’s Pride was pleased to support the 2025 inauguration ceremony,” the spokesperson says. “We have a long bipartisan history of participating in the civic process and look forward to working with the Administration to create opportunities for American farmers and provide safe, affordable food for American families.” JBS was founded in 1953 when then-19-year-old Jose Batista Sobrinho, the namesake of the company, began carving up oxen and selling the meat to locals around the family’s small farm in Anapolis, a rural region in Central Brazil. Joesley and Wesley were born into the family business as Brazilian beef started booming in the 1970s. The brothers dropped out of high school to work full-time for JBS, by then a major Brazilian meatpacker, which was then run by Jose Batista, their eldest brother. But in 2005, Jose left JBS for an ill-fated attempt at politics and Joesley and Wesley, then in their thirties, took over. They took JBS public at a valuation equivalent to $800 million on Brazil’s São Paolo-based B3 stock exchange in 2007, which was at the time the most successful debut in the history of its stock market. Soon after going public, the Batistas looked to supersize their business by taking JBS abroad. The Batistas, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission cease-and-desist order from 2020, were willing to buy their way in. According to his testimony to Brazilian investigators in 2017, Joesley had a network of government officials and politicians on his payroll, including a finance minister at the Brazilian development bank BNDES, who received kickbacks for helping finance acquisitions of American assets, including Pilgrim’s Pride. (BNDES, which also became JBS’ second-largest shareholder, has denied allegations of corruption and bribery, citing an independent investigation at the time that found no evidence. A Brazilian federal court also refused to charge JBS with a crime in connection with the bribery.) After Texas-based Pilgrim’s Pride went bankrupt, in 2009 the Batistas targeted America’s second-largest chicken processor, which they viewed as a bargain. For an initial 64% of the company, JBS spent $800 million. The deal had an enterprise value of $2.8 billion with BNDES providing $2 billion in financing. According to the DOJ indictment against J&F, the bribe Joesley Batista deposited into a U.S. bank account for the BNDES finance minister was more than $55 million. JBS eventually secured an estimated nearly $5 billion in total equity and debt financing from BNDES across several U.S. deals, including Pilgrim’s Pride. In all, the Batistas and J&F agreed to more than three dozen incidents of bribery in Brazil, according to their 2017 cooperation agreements with the Brazilian government. The DOJ and SEC found evidence of some $150 million in kickbacks. According to the SEC’s 2020 case against JBS, publicly traded Pilgrim’s Pride, which the Batistas eventually amassed an 80% stake in, even became a slush fund for the brothers: “From 2009 to 2015, unbeknownst to Pilgrim’s management, the [Batistas and J&F] carried out the bribery scheme and its funding using, at times, certain JBS operating accounts which contained funds that were commingled with funds obtained from Pilgrim’s through intercompany transfers, special dividend payments, and other means. Pilgrim’s books did not reflect this.” The scheme came crashing down when Brazilian investigators, in the middle of a sweeping country-wide corruption probe in 2017, had Joesley Batista wear a wire to snare the then-President of Brazil, Michel Temer, who Joesley alleged was on the Batistas’ payroll. On the recording, Temer can be heard discussing Joesley giving a bribe to another politician on Temer’s behalf. After the recording leaked, the Brazilian real tanked and there were massive street protests in Brazil. Despite their cooperation, the Batistas didn’t avoid jail time—they ended up serving about six months, starting in September 2017. And as these bribes, and other unrelated bribes to meat inspectors in Brazil, were revealed to the public, their attempts to list JBS in the U.S. were delayed. “There were some rocky years there,” says John Baumgarten, a managing director at Mizuho Group who covers food companies, including JBS. “They had to take a few steps backwards.” In addition to the extensive bribery scheme, JBS has also faced allegations of environmental damage, particularly that it knowingly buys cattle that have been raised on ranchland created by deforesting the Amazon. JBS’ spokesperson denies that, and says the company is “deeply committed to zero deforestation in our supply chain and are actively investing in sustainable agricultural practices. We continue to collaborate with our suppliers to promote responsible land use and reduce our shared environmental footprint.” But representatives of the Parakanã people in Brazil allege that JBS illegally exploited the Apyterewa Indigenous Territory in the rainforest by buying cattle raised on cleared acres. According to a letter sent to then-SEC chairman Gary Gensler in 2023 asking for the listing to be blocked, which was obtained by Forbes through a Freedom of Information Act request, community leader Wenatoa said “Our people suffer daily threats from invaders, and JBS is an accomplice in this invasion…We will not be silent as long as our lands, culture and dignity continue to be harmed by irresponsible business practices like this.” Now that the public listing is approved, it will give JBS access to U.S.-only investors, pensions and stock indices. The share price is expected to take off, with HSBC’s Laboy estimating JBS could double in value. That would give JBS “more resources to solve the environmental issues that need to be solved.” Overall, Laboy sees the listing as a way to rein in JBS. “It probably behooves the U.S. authorities to have JBS listed on the New York Stock Exchange because it increases the regulatory oversight,” he says. “More oversight of the market leader intensifies the regulatory pressure on bad behavior in the broader industry." Either way, the Batistas are not going anywhere. Once JBS is listed, the family holding companies, J&F and JBS Participações, which owns nearly 50% as the largest shareholder of JBS, will get the chance to convert its common shares to preferred, increasing the Batistas’ voting power to as much as 90%. While JBS declined to comment on the Batistas’ long-term plans, the move ensures that the family will be involved for years to come. Because of that family control, Laboy believes that “strong independent voices on the board of directors” are a must. But, as it stands, the board of directors under the NYSE-listed company will include Joesley and Wesley Batista, who were forced to leave the board when they were arrested in 2017. They had been banned from leadership roles for years but they both returned to management at J&F in 2020 after a Brazilian judge ordered it, and in 2024 they were both reelected to the JBS board. “A strong board with independent members of unquestionable integrity would be optimal for all shareholders of JBS,” Laboy adds, “including [the Batistas].”

Ever since Donald J. Trump was re-elected president, we’ve witnessed a disheartening spectacle: big tech companies bending their knees to him, hoping to get him to kill antitrust actions against them and defend them from European Union rules and fines. Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon founder and Executive Chairman Jeff Bezos, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, and Apple CEO Tim Cook have all in one way or another shown or declared support for the president’s agenda, especially his opposition to DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion) programs. Notably, all four attended his Jan. 20 inauguration and were front and center during the proceedings. Zuckerberg killed DEI efforts at Meta, abandoned attempts to contain misinformation on his services, makes regular pilgrimages to Mar-a-Lago, and called then-candidate Trump a “badass” after last year’s assassination attempt. He sounded like nothing so much as Trump himself (while using words of more than one syllable) when he told Joe Rogan on a podcast: “The corporate world is pretty culturally neutered. A culture that celebrates aggression a bit more has its own merits. Masculine energy, I think, is good.” Bezos killed DEI at Amazon. As the owner of The Washington Post he also squashed the newspaper’s endorsement of then-Vice President Kamala Harris last fall, killed a cartoon of tech leaders and Mickey Mouse bowing down to Trump, and ruled that the paper’s editorial and opinion pages will become right-wing, covering only “personal liberty and free markets,” with no opposing viewpoints allowed. Pichai killed off DEI efforts at Google and makes regular visits to see Trump in Florida. Cook is a bit of an outlier — although he attended the inauguration, he didn’t kill DEI at Apple and has made noises about working with Trump on tariff issues. The four companies haven’t gotten anything (yet) for their efforts; legal action against them begun under Trump’s predecessor are proceeding. Google faces being broken up after a judge ruled it illegally monopolized the advertising tech market. Meta is being prosecuted for illegally monopolizing the social media market by buying Instagram and What’s App and could be broken up as well. Amazon has been charged by the FTC with protecting its online retail monopoly by imposing fees on third-party sellers and favoring its own services over theirs. Apple has been sued by the Department of Justice for a variety of antitrust actions in protecting and extending its monopoly in the smartphone market. And while Trump has made statements about EU regulators — the White House last month criticized recent fines against Meta and Apple as a “novel form of economic extortion” — but has done little to get the EU to halt its actions against the companies. Meanwhile, Microsoft not only won’t valorize Trump, it’s also pushing back against him. The company has publicly supported its DEI efforts rather than killing them. In December, the company’s Chief Diversity Officer, Lindsay-Rae McIntyr, wrote on LinkedIn that Microsoft’s DEI efforts are vital to the company’s success: “The business case for D&I [diversity and inclusion] is not only a constant, but is stronger than ever, reinforcing our belief that a diverse and inclusive workforce is crucial for innovation and success.” When worries surfaced that Trump might require American tech companies to suspend their cloud operations in Europe, or turn Europeans’ data over to the federal government as part of a trade war, Microsoft Vice Chair and President Brad Smith wrote in a blog post that he won’t turn over the data or suspend European cloud operations. In fact, he said the company is expanding them. He also said he would sue the Trump administration to protect them, if necessary. Two days after that, Microsoft dropped the big law firm of Simpson Thacher & Bartlett, which had agreed to give the administration $125 million in free legal work after threats from Trump. Microsoft hired Jenner & Block to take its place — and Jenner & Block sued the Trump administration instead of giving in to it. You might expect that after all that, Trump would have publicly attacked Microsoft or used the power of his office to go after the company. So far, that hasn’t happened. And unlike Meta, Apple, Google, and Amazon, Microsoft has thrived since Trump took office. Its stock price inched up from $434 a share just before Trump’s inauguration past $445 this week, while the share prices of the others have all declined, sometimes significantly. Along the way, Microsoft became the world’s most valuable company, with a market cap approaching $3.3 trillion. Gauging by the company’s most recent quarterly results, even better times may be ahead. The New York Times had this to say about the results: “Overall, Microsoft’s results showed unexpected strength in its business. Sales surpassed $70 billion, up 13% from the same period a year earlier. Profit rose to $25.8 billion, up 18%. The results far exceeded Wall Street’s expectations. Despite the economic uncertainty, the company predicted more strength ahead, saying revenue would surpass $73 billion in the current quarter.” All that said, Microsoft is being investigated by the feds for possible antitrust violations having to do with AI and cloud computing. That investigation, like the others, wasn’t begun by the Trump administration; it was set in motion during the Biden administration. So far, Microsoft’s actions don’t appear to have had any effect on the suit — or the company. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has shown that it’s possible for a company to maintain its values under Trump and thrive. Amazon, Apple, Google, and Meta should follow suit.

Title: Microsoft Layoffs Impact 7,000 Workers As Company Adjusts For AI
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/chriswestfall/2025/05/13/microsoft-layoffs-impact-7000-workers-as-company-adjusts-for-ai/

ByChris Westfall ByChris Westfall, Contributor. Layoffs driven by AI investment will effect more than 6,000 employees. In a move signaling a significant strategic pivot, Microsoft today announced a reduction of its workforce by more than 6,000 employees, representing about 3% of its total headcount. While such news often triggers concerns about automation and job displacement due to artificial intelligence, the company indicated a different rationale: This adjustment is a calculated step to optimize resources and ensure continued robust investment in Microsoft’s burgeoning AI platform. The decision to streamline certain operations (and create bottom-line impact) is designed to free up capital to drive the company’s AI-centric strategy. “We have made huge investments in AI because we are optimistic about what it can do to help people, industry and society, and because we’re committed to bringing technology and people together to realize the promises of AI responsibly," the company has previously shared on its website. Reuters reports that it is this investment in new AI initiatives, not the AI technology itself, that has caused the company to reduce its staff. However, CEO Satya Nadella told a Silicon Valley audience that “maybe 20, 30% of the code that is inside of our repos today, and some of our projects, are probably all written by software.” In that same conversation, on stage with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Nadella described his vision for Microsoft as a ”distillation factory", where they would take large, general purpose AI models and shrink them down into smaller, specialized and even task-specific models. Nadella has often spoken of the “democratization of AI” and his plans for the technology. Indeed, efforts are underway to target businesses with AI-powered tools and platforms, as the company embeds AI capabilities into mainstay products like Microsoft 365, Azure, and Dynamics365. And Wall Street has responded in a positive way. Microsoft’s gross profit margins have consistently been in the high 60’s-low 70% range over the last few years, making the stock a favorite for institutional investors. On Monday, Microsoft shares ended trading at $449.26, the highest price so far this year. (They closed at a record $467.56 last July). The company recently reported quarterly revenues of $70.07 billion, beating Wall Street expectations. For comparison, Nadella has said the company will spend $80 billion in fiscal year 2025 on AI-related efforts. Analyst Gil Luria says that headcount reduction is a natural result of those kinds of capital investment numbers, hinting that more layoffs might be ahead. “We believe that every year Microsoft invests at the current levels, it would need to reduce headcount by at least 10,000 in order to make up for the higher depreciation levels due to their capital expenditures,” Luria said, according to Reuters. The displaced workforce includes about 1,985 workers in Washington state, where the company is headquartered. Overall, there are 228,000 workers at the company. The layoff news for these laid off workers can’t be easy, as the trend in tech layoffs continues. Corrected, May 14: An earlier version of this article misstated the number of Microsoft employees likely to be cut; it’s more than 6,000, or less than 3% of the company’s workforce.

We read every piece of feedback, and take your input very seriously. To see all available qualifiers, see our documentation. An Unofficial UniFi Network & Protect API Client & CLI, written in Golang An Unofficial UniFi Network & Protect API Client & CLI command, written in Golang. Install unified from go: Set your UniFi API key Try it out: If all goes well, you should see something like: Note that the output is valid JSON, just like the UniFi applications produce. --debug is a helpful flag if you'd like to see more information about unified's operation. Log output is printed to stderr by default. This way logging doesn't interfere with parsing of unified's regular stdout output. unified has a full help system accessible through the --help flag. To access the Network API you will use: and for the Protect API use: unified can be configured via a yaml file: Which can be located at any of the following: Or you can manually specify which config file to use with the --config flag. Learn how to generate an API key from UniFi's official documentation. Network and Protect are "Local Applications". Warning Your API key is a sensitive secret! Please keep it securely stored. It gives FULL API access to your UniFi applications. If you need to revoke an API key navigate to your UniFi application and then to your Admin user: Settings -> Admins & User -> Select Admin account associated with the API key -> Click on API Key -> Remove. You can always generate a new API key if necessary. Now, you can pass your API key to unified in one of two ways: To instantiate a client you should call client.NewClient: Access to actual API client calls is mediated through NetworkV1 and ProtectV1 interfaces. Like so: These interfaces strive to closely mirror the actual APIs exposed by the Network and Protect applications. Protect's API has a couple of interesting endpoints which allow a client to subscribe to a Websocket event stream. The ProtectV1 interface exposes a pair of methods which provide easy access to those streams as golang channels: and while it's certainly do-able to consume those event channels, unified also provides a handler for each event type that makes consuming and re-acting to these events even easier. Here's a brief example of using ProtectEventStreamHandler: A nearly-identical struct exists to handle ProtectDeviceEvents: ProtectDeviceEventStreamHandler. doorbell.go is a full example of using a stream handler. Example programs can be built via: Full Protect API support is planned in short order. After the initial versioned release of this project, work will proceed towards full Protect V1 API support. As well as a full v1.0.0 release. Reference documentation through godoc is also a priority before a v1.0.0 release. Access API might be supported in a future release. Contributions welcome here. Unifi's provided TLS certificates are self-signed and do not sign for the unifi hostname. They do sign for unifi.local, but the default DNS configuration for my UDM Pro does not seem to add an entry for unifi.local. Therefore TLS verification generally fails when https protocol connections are attemped. unified defaults to TLS verification being off. In short, at least two general issues need to be solved to enable TLS verification by default: I'd like to find an easy way to solve these two issues and re-enable TLS verification by default before a full v1.0.0 release. UniFi Network API V1 is fully supported as of Network application version "9.1.120". UniFi Protect API is only partially supported, with the following endpoints supported: UniFi Access API is not yet supported. Contributions are welcome! Before submiting any PRs, please ensure your commits build and lint. Also, take care to test any changes, and ideally submit unit tests or integration tests which cover your changes. PRs must pass all CI in order to be considered acceptable to merge. If you'd like to contribute a feature or API support that doesn't yet exist, please communicate your intention through a new or existing GitHub issue. Let's try to avoid duplicating work, and make sure the work aligns with project goals. If you find a bug, please report it via GitHub issues. The more descriptive you can be, the better. Please include specific steps to reproduce. Bonus points for submitting a PR to fix it! Unified is built primarily via mage. All command examples assume current working directory is the repository root. To build the unified CLI command you would run: Which will build unified as well as any of its dependencies. If successful, it should place the binary at build/unified. Will run any unit tests available. Which are not many at this point. Any reasonable unit test contributions are welcome. If you have a UniFi API host available, you can run integration tests: This will run an integration test that uses ./build/unified to send requests to https://unifi and verify results. Warning While designed to be non-destructive to existing application objects and configuration, some non-GET endpoints are called. Please take a look at existing integration tests and verify you're comfortable running them against your API host. We are not responsible for any harm they might cause to your network device/control-plane. There are facilities to backup your configuration and we strongly suggest you do so before running these tests. Thanks for checking this project out. Hope it helps you in some way. If it does, consider buying me a coffee or otherwise contributing back to the project in some way. Thanks again!

Title: U.S.-China Tariff Thaw Sparks Stock Rally—Making Bezos, Musk And Zuckerberg More Than $40 Billion Richer

ByDerek Saul ByDerek Saul, Forbes Staff. Stocks surged across the board Monday as the U.S. and China’s trade war deescalated significantly, and the most valuable American companies largely slumping from the Beijing vs. Washington standoff roared back to life. Stocks surged Monday after a "dream scenario" for bulls emerged out of this weekend's U.S.-China ... More talks. This weekend’s talks between Washington and Beijing officials in Geneva culminated in both countries cutting their tariff for at least the next 90 days, with the U.S. slashing its duties on Chinese goods from 145% to 30% and China cutting its levies on U.S. goods from 125% to 10%. That led to a surge in global stocks as the most concrete evidence yet of Washington backing down from its most stark trade war plans, as the Hang Seng Index of Hong Kong-listed stocks soared 3% in Monday trading, with similar gains across U.S. indexes. The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average popped 2.8%, or 1,160 points, while the benchmark S&P 500 jumped 3.3% and tech-concentrated Nasdaq ripped forward 4.4%. The Dow, S&P and Nasdaq closed at their highest levels since March 26, March 3 and Feb. 28, respectively. Leading the charge were the tech behemoths perhaps most reliant on a symbiotic relationship with the U.S. and China, as shares of Amazon (up 8%), Apple (6%), Nvidia (5%) and Tesla (7%) all outperformed the broader market. Also rallying were the stocks of fellow “magnificent seven” constituents Alphabet (3%), Meta (8%) and Microsoft (2%). $830 billion. That’s about how much market capitalization the aforementioned seven tech giants added Monday, led by Apple, Amazon and Nvidia’s more than $150 billion respective surges. Elon Musk’s electric vehicle company surpassed a $1 trillion valuation for the first time since late February during Monday’s rally. Tesla’s roughly $320 share price is still below its all-time high of nearly $490 set in December as investors flooded into the stock in anticipation of what Musk’s involvement in the Trump administration may mean for his company. Already the richest person in the world, Musk enjoyed an $11 billion bump to his net worth as Tesla shares rallied, extending his fortune to $407 billion, according to Forbes’ latest estimates. The planet’s second-wealthiest person Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Earth’s third-richest person Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg enjoyed $14 billion and $16 billion respective net worth bumps, though both men are still more than $180 billion poorer than Musk. The U.S.-China deescalation was a “huge win for the bulls,” remarked Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a Monday note to clients, saying the dramatic lowering of tariffs was a “dream scenario” for the U.S. tech industry. As investors fled into riskier stocks, assets viewed as safe havens from the tariff-induced market slump struggled. Gold prices tumbled 3% to below $3,240 per troy ounce, the lowest level since April 10 and the largest single-day loss since November. Yields for 2-year and 10-year U.S. Treasury notes spiked by about 10 basis points apiece Monday, with the higher yields signifying less valuable bonds as the safe returns of Treasuries prove less appealing in a more friendly operating environment for public companies. The S&P is up almost 20% from its early April nadir, just ahead of President Donald Trump’s first tariff blink, but the U.S. equity yardstick is still down 3% since Trump’s January inauguration. Trump campaigned on raising tariffs and targeted Canada, China and Mexico with country-specific actions in his first two months, but the country-by-country tariffs he laid out during his April 2 “Liberation Day” event were far more hawkish than Wall Street anticipated. The S&P tanked 12% in the five trading sessions following that speech, which led to a chorus of economists warning the sudden, sharp rise in import costs could send the U.S. into an avoidable recession. Trump began to loosen his tariff belt April 9 when he paused much of the most severe duties for 90 days, though he didn’t show much leeway on Chinese levies until last week, when he floated an 80% tariff on Chinese goods, nearly three times as severe as the rate announced Monday. Apple, Nvidia and Tesla are among the American companies with the heaviest revenue exposure to China, which accounted for at least 17% of each of those companies’ 2024 sales, while Amazon relies on China as half of its third-party sellers originate from the country. Public companies mentioned “tariffs” on earnings calls this quarter more than twice as much as they did during any quarter in Trump’s first term, according to Morgan Stanley research, evidence of the more heightened concerns on bottom lines from this round of tariffs.

Title: Time To Buy META Stock After The U.S. China Trade Deal?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. MUMBAI, MAHARASHTRA, INDIA - 2025/05/02: Meta logo is seen at their stall during the World Audio ... More Visual & Entertainment Summit (WAVES) event in Mumbai. (Photo by Ashish Vaishnav/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Following positive developments in U.S.-China trade negotiations, Meta stock (NASDAQ:META) is trending upward, showing a 7% gain in pre-market trading. This surge is likely driven by the announcement that both nations have agreed to a 90-day pause on tariff increases and a significant reduction in existing tariff levels. Specifically, reciprocal tariffs are set to decrease by 115%, from the current 125% to 10%. Previously, investors had expressed concerns about the potential impact of tariffs on Meta Platforms. Meta's business model necessitates significant infrastructure scaling to support its algorithms, power Reels, and advance its growing AI capabilities. Higher tariffs would have increased the cost of this infrastructure development. Coupled with anxieties regarding a possible pullback in advertising spending, this created a worrisome outlook for the company. However, the newly announced 90-day tariff pause is being viewed favorably by investors, alleviating some of these immediate concerns. Furthermore, the substantial tariff reduction signals a potential breakthrough in trade discussions, indicating a shared desire to ease trade tensions. Market attention will now turn to whether this development signifies the start of a more comprehensive and lasting trade agreement. Also, see – Is The U.S.-China Trade War Over? Beyond these macroeconomic factors, META stock appears to be an attractive investment at its current pre-market price of approximately $630. We believe that the concerns surrounding META stock are currently minimal, making its high valuation justified. Our positive assessment is based on a comparison of META's present valuation against its recent operating performance, as well as its current and historical financial health. Our analysis across key metrics—Growth, Profitability, Financial Stability, and Downturn Resilience—indicates that Meta Platforms exhibits very strong operating performance and a robust financial condition, as will be detailed subsequently. However, for investors who seek lower volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio presents an alternative - having outperformed the S&P 500 and generated returns exceeding 91% since its inception. Separately, see – Will AI Really Disrupt Google’s Search Empire? Going by what you pay per dollar of sales or profit, META stock looks expensive compared to the broader market. Meta Platforms’ Revenues have grown considerably over recent years. Meta Platforms' profit margins are considerably higher than most companies in the Trefis coverage universe. Meta Platforms' balance sheet looks very strong. META stock has seen an impact that was slightly worse than the benchmark S&P 500 index during some of the recent downturns. While investors have their fingers crossed for a soft landing by the U.S. economy, how bad can things get if there is another recession? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash captures how key stocks fared during and after the last six market crashes. In summary, Meta Platforms' performance across the parameters detailed above are as follows: META stock demonstrated strong performance across the key parameters we analyzed. While its valuation of 9.7x trailing revenues is on the higher end, this appears justified by its accelerating sales growth and improving profitability. In light of these strong fundamentals, and now considering the positive momentum generated by the U.S.-China trade talk developments and the 90-day tariff pause, we believe that META stock still presents a compelling buying opportunity for substantial long-term gains. While META stock looks promising, investing in a single stock can be risky. On the other hand, the Trefis High Quality (HQ) Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has a track record of comfortably outperforming the S&P 500 over the last 4-year period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.
