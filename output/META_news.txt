Cecilia Hult is an editorial intern based in Hong Kong. Investors are flocking to Chinese markets in a search for alternatives to U.S. equities. DeepSeek’s AI breakthrough earlier this year proved that China could compete on the technological frontier. Economists are betting that Beijing might finally unleash more stimulus to revive flagging domestic consumption. And policy volatility in Washington, thanks to U.S. President Donald Trump’s trade war, is pushing investors to start diversifying their portfolios away from the U.S. It’s a big shift from earlier arguments that Chinese companies were “uninvestable” due to concerns about policy uncertainty and China’s sluggish economy. Hong Kong’s benchmark Hang Seng Index is up by over 20% so far this year, even as Trump threatened steep tariffs on imports from China. By comparison, the S&P 500 is up by around 2%. Investors have used the “Magnificent 7”—Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla—as shorthand for the top-performing stocks on U.S. markets. These seven companies both reflect U.S. strength in Big Tech and tap into major trends like AI. But what about China? Investment bank Goldman Sachs, in a report released last week, highlighted 10 stocks that are best poised for growth in the Chinese market. Together, they make up what the bank calls the “Prominent 10”, or “Prom 10” for short. Unlike the Magnificent 7, these stocks cover more than just tech and AI, extending into retail and other consumer services. Together, the stocks amount to $1.6 trillion in market value, according to Goldman Sachs, compared to $19 trillion for the Mag 7. The bank predicts that the Prom 10’s earnings will grow by an average of 13% annually over the next two years. The Prom 10 “collectively embody the theme of AI/Tech development, self-sufficiency, ‘Going Global’, services and new forms of consumption, and China’s improving shareholder returns,” Goldman Sachs wrote in its report. The bank also suggests that its chosen companies have more opportunities to expand and consolidate their positions in the more fragmented Chinese economy. The most valuable company on the Prom 10 is Tencent, one of the world’s largest video game publishers and operator of the ubiquitous WeChat messaging app. Tencent’s superapp is one of a handful of platforms that boasts over a billion users. Valued at around $585 billion, Tencent is Asia’s second-most valuable company, behind chipmaker TSMC. E-commerce giant Alibaba is also on the Prom 10. Shares in the company are up more than 35% so far this year, thanks to optimism around AI. Developers both inside and outside of China are embracing the company’s open-source Qwen model, making Alibaba the AI leader among the country’s big tech companies. Meituan, China’s food delivery giant, is another Prom 10 stock. The company holds a 70% market share in the delivery space, and is expanding to new markets like Hong Kong, Saudi Arabia, and Brazil. Yet the stock has taken a beating in recent weeks due to fierce competition from JD.com, another e-commerce giant. BYD, the world’s largest producer of electric vehicles, and Xiaomi, a major Chinese smartphone brand that’s recently expanded to cars, also hold spots in Goldman Sachs’ “Prom 10.” Chinese EVs are quickly winning over customers both in China and overseas, due to the affordable price points and appealing designs. That’s helped boost the shares of both companies: BYD and Xiaomi are up by around 45% and 60% respectively. Midea Group is one of China’s leading manufacturers of home appliances and another Prom 10 stock. The company debuted on Hong Kong’s stock exchange last year, raising almost $4 billion. Tencent, Alibaba, Meituan, Xiaomi, BYD, and Midea are all on Fortune’s Global 500, which ranks the world’s largest companies by revenue. Rounding out the Prom 10 are NetEase Games, the second-highest grossing gaming company in China; Hengrui, a leading pharmaceutical manufacturer; Trip.com, a travel booking platform; and ANTA, the world’s third-largest sportswear company, behind Nike and Adidas. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

The world's most viewed site on global warming and climate change Quote of the Week: “No government has the right to decide on the truth of scientific principles.” — Richard Feynman, The Meaning of It All: Thoughts of a Citizen-Scientist (1998) Number of the Week: 35,000 MWh needed, 4.6 MWh approved THIS WEEK: By Ken Haapala, President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP) Scope: TWTW begins with a paper by Richard Lindzen and William Happer calling for a repeal of the misnamed Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) which provided hundreds of millions of dollars in subsidies to unreliable wind and solar. TWTW continues with the significant omissions in proclamations by NOAA and other organizations in claiming increasing carbon dioxide is acidifying the oceans. TWTW discusses assertions by organizations and individuals that climate misinformation should be criminalized, ignoring the fact that such organizations and individuals rely on information that fails to meet the standards of the scientific method. TWTW questions what is meant by an existential threat, then concludes with a presentation of part of the program of the upcoming DDP conference and where to register to attend in person or by Zoom. ********************* Repeal IRA Subsidies: Last week, TWTW focused on a paper by Richard Lindzen and William Happer emphasizing Gold Standard Science. “Scientific Knowledge Is Determined by the Scientific Method, Not by Government Opinion, Consensus, 97% of Scientists’ Opinions, Peer Review, Models that Do Not Work, or Cherry-Picked, Fabricated, Falsified or Omitted Contradictory Data.” This week, the CO2 Coalition published a paper by the same two authors titled “IRA Climate Subsidies Should Be Repealed.” The authors state: “Physics demonstrates that the Inflation Reduction Act’s (IRA’s) trillion-dollar climate subsidies rest on false science. The real science, which is virtually never reported, is that the IRA subsidies of $4.7 trillion (Cato’s estimate to 2050) aim to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions will have no climate benefit, for two separate and cumulative reasons: First, the physics of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases shows that reducing them to net zero will have a negligible effect on temperatures and extreme weather. At present, there are no effective replacements for fossil fuels, and eliminating them will be disastrous for people worldwide. The scientific fact is that doubling carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would increase the world’s food supply by about 40%, with a trivial effect on Earth’s climate. Second, the theory that GHG emissions are the primary driver of climate change is based on false science, such as consensus, theoretical models that do not work, fabricated and falsified data, agenda-driven peer review and government opinions. None of this is real science. (See our June 7, 2025, paper for details, Physics Demonstrates That Increasing Greenhouse Gases Cannot Cause Dangerous Warming, Extreme Weather or Any Harm.) In summary, IRA subsidies will waste trillions of dollars for no climate benefit, reducing carbon dioxide emissions will reduce the amount of food worldwide, eliminating fossil fuels will be disastrous for people worldwide, and the trillions of dollars would be better spent improving Americans’ standard of living. Accordingly, all the IRA climate subsidies should be repealed ASAP.” See link under Challenging the Orthodoxy. ********************** Another Significant Omission: The false Endangerment Finding by the EPA under Lisa Jackson in 2009 under the Obama Administration asserts: “elevated concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may reasonably be anticipated to endanger the public health and to endanger the public welfare of current and future generations.” The finding ignores or omits contradictory evidence including the only comprehensive global temperature data existing, the estimates of temperature from satellite evidence calculated since 1979 by Roy Spencer and John Christy and published monthly by the Earth System Science Center, University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH). Similar calculations by Remote Sensing Systems (RSS) independently verify their results. In 1998. Frank Wentz and Matthias Schabel of RSS discovered that UAH failed to correctly compensate for orbital drift. When the error was discovered and verified, Spencer and Christy quickly made appropriate adjustments, in keeping with the scientific method. Errors need to be exposed, verified, and corrected. Ignoring them or omitting them is contrary to the scientific method. For years, NOAA’s Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research has funded the Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL), a climate modeling laboratory at Princeton. NOAA also funds the Cooperative Institute for Modeling the Earth System (CIMES), which is a collaboration between GFDL and Princeton University. For over forty years, GFDL and CIMES have ignored UAH data and have omitted validating their models against atmospheric data, which is where the greenhouse gas effect occurs. NOAA funds organizations that systematically ignore the scientific method and fail to test their predictions against physical evidence. The findings of these organizations cannot be considered scientific. Another NOAA activity that is considered scientific but fails the scientific method is ocean acidification which was boosted when environmental ecologist Jane Lubchenco was administrator of NOAA during the Obama administration from 2009 to 2013. The claim that adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere will acidify the oceans contains a bit of scientific fact surrounded by a bodyguard of lies and omissions. As a gas, water vapor contains no CO2 and has a pH of 7 which is neutral. But when it liquefies in the atmosphere and falls as rain, it absorbs CO2 making a weak acid, carbonic acid. All rain is carbonic acid and has a pH ranging from 4 to 6. Thus, it is common that in land areas with moderate to heavy rainfall, such as the tropics, the soils are acidic. Millions of years of rainfall have washed CO2 from the atmosphere into the oceans. Roughly, there is about 50 to 60 times more carbon dioxide in oceans than in the atmosphere. So, direct rainfall will slightly increase CO2 in the oceans, slightly lowering the pH. Yet after millions of years of rainfall, the oceans are alkaline with pH of about 8.1. A fact that NOAA and others ignore. To recall, the acidity or alkalinity of a solution is measured by the pH scale with 7 as neutral. The scale is a base 10 logarithm. Alkaline drain cleaner has a pH of about 14; bleach has a pH of about 13. Is bleach 10 times more acidic than alkaline drain cleaner? Hen eggs have a pH of about 8 (oceans 8.1); sweet cream butter has a pH of about 6.0 to 6.7. Does cooking eggs in butter make them acidic? Further, the areas in the oceans, called Marine primary production areas or regions, are areas where ocean upwellings bring carbon dioxide and other nutrients to the surface and marine life flourishes. Examples are the Grand Banks in the Atlantic off Canada, the area off Monterey, California, off Canada and Alaska, and off most of Europe. As with most such distortions, the claim of ocean acidification requires a huge ignorance of geological history. Mollusks evolved in the Cambrian explosion of life, about 540 million years ago, when CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere were about ten times what they are today. Marine creatures with shells containing calcium carbonate evolved before then, with even higher concentrations of CO2. Great limestone beds were laid down during the hot, high CO2 Cambrian period. Reef building corals evolved around 245 million years ago. Since then, Earth has experienced periods far hotter than today and periods with CO2 concentrations far greater than today. Reef-building corals have a symbiotic relationship with microscopic algae called zooxanthellae, which live within their tissues. The coral provides the algae with a protected environment and the carbon dioxide and nitrogen (for chlorophyll and other compounds) needed for photosynthesis, while the algae, through photosynthesis, provides the coral with energy, nutrients, and their vibrant colors. Changes in water temperatures, salinity, or solar irradiance can cause corals to expel the algae, turning them white. They are not dead but may need a different variety of zooxanthellae, which are diverse with many clades (groups of organisms believed to have a common ancestor) and types. There is no reason to assume that a modest lowering of pH will kill corals any more than slow changes in temperatures will kill them. However, human causes including sediment from land disturbances and destructive fishing practices such as using dynamite and cyanide do kill them. Water running into the oceans for millions of years often passes over many types of alkaline material resulting in a pH of about 8.1, alkaline. The best scientific explanation why increasing atmospheric concentrations of CO2 will not acidify the oceans TWTW has seen was written by the late Roger Cohen and William Happer ten years ago. The paper is mathematical, but the summary is clear. The authors begin the section titled Alkalinity of the Unbuffered Ocean with: Ocean water is salty because of the weathering of the earth’s rocks by rainwater, and because of salts dissolved from the ocean floor, especially near plate-spreading boundaries. The salt water contains positive ions (cations), mainly sodium Na+, magnesium Mg2+, calcium Ca2+ and potassium K+. For clarity, we can think of the ions as coming from the strong bases NaOH, and potassium hydroxide, KOH (lye) and much less soluble magnesium hydroxide, Mg(OH)2 and calcium hydroxide Ca(OH)2 (slaked lime). The ocean also contains negative ions (anions), mainly chloride Cl− and sulfate SO4− 2, which we can think of the anions as coming from the strong acids, hydrochloric acid, HCl and sulfuric acid, H2SO4. For want of a better word, we will refer to the cations of strong bases, and anions of strong acids as pH-independent ions. The concentration of pH-independent ions is unaffected by normal changes in the pH of water. Further, the authors explain how weak acids (notably carbonic acid (H2CO3)) make rainwater slightly acidic, with a pH = 5.4 (vinegar has pH ~ 3). The authors estimate that if the oceans were not buffered by weak acids, the oceans would have a pH of about 11.4. The Summary states [figures not shown here, boldface added]: “This minimalist discussion already shows how hard it is to scare informed people with ocean acidification, but, alas, many people are not informed. For example: • The oceans would be highly alkaline with a pH of about 11.4, similar to that of household ammonia, if there were no weak acids to buffer the alkalinity. Almost all of the buffering is provided by dissolved CO2, with very minor additional buffering from boric acid, silicic acid, and other even less important species. • Doubling atmospheric CO2 from the current level of 400 ppm to 800 ppm only decreases the pH of ocean water from about 8.2 to 7.9. This is well within the day-night fluctuations that already occur because of photosynthesis by plankton and less than the pH decreases with depth that occur because of the biological pump and the dissolution of calcium carbonate precipitates below the lysocline. [The depth where the rate of dissolution of calcium carbonate starts to increase significantly due to these changes in pressure and temperature.] • Doubling atmospheric CO2 from the current level of 400 ppm to 800 ppm only decreases the carbonate-ion concentration, [CO2− 3], by about 30%. Ocean surface waters are already supersaturated by several hundred per cent for formation of CaCO3 crystals from Ca2+ and CO2− 3. So, scare stories about dissolving carbonate shells are nonsense. • The ocean has only absorbed 1/3 or less of the CO2 that it would eventually absorb when the concentrations of CO2 in the deep oceans came to equilibrium with surface concentrations. Effects like that of the biological pump and calcium carbonate dissolution below the lysocline allow the ocean to absorb substantially more than the amount that would be in chemical-equilibrium with the atmosphere. • Over most of the Phanerozoic, the past 550 million years, CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere have been measured in thousands of parts per million, and life flourished in both the oceans and on land. This is hardly surprising, given the relative insensitivity of ocean pH to large changes in CO2 concentrations that we have discussed above and given the fact that the pH changes that do occur are small compared to the natural variations of ocean pH in space and time.” This is another instance where US government “science” is so politicized that it becomes nonsense. See link under Challenging the Orthodoxy. ********************** Censorship: An organization called the International Panel on the Information Environment has produced a report titled: “Facts, Fakes, and Climate Science: Recommendations for Improving Information Integrity about Climate Science.” The Synopsis of the report states: Misleading information about the causes and consequences of climate change obstructs effective policy responses. This Summary for Policymakers summarizes findings from the larger Synthesis Report “Information Integrity about Climate Science: A Systematic Review” (SR2025.1). The central conclusion of the Synthesis Report is that powerful actors—including corporations, governments, and political parties—intentionally spread inaccurate or misleading narratives about anthropogenic climate change. These narratives circulate across digital, broadcast, and interpersonal communication channels. The result is a decline in public trust, diminished policy coordination, and a feedback loop between scientific denialism and political inaction. There is a severe gap in research on climate information integrity in the Global South, where impacts are likely to be significant but poorly documented. Key takeaways from the synthesis include: 1. coordinated misinformation campaigns actively shape climate narratives; 2. scientific consensus is frequently misrepresented in media; 3. regulatory enforcement and access to data remain uneven globally; 4. information integrity research is heavily concentrated in the Global North. The report concludes with an assessment of policy recommendations that have been made over time, identifying for policymakers the four areas where impact has been consistently positive: • legislation to ensure standardized carbon reporting and labelling, • litigation to ensure enforcement of the standards, • coalition building across stakeholder groups, • education of policymakers and the public. This study delivers the first global, systematic assessment of information integrity about climate science. It draws on research by hundreds of scholars and thousands of peer-reviewed studies published over the past decade, with a methodologically rigorous review of 300 papers on policy solutions. This consolidated evidence base affirms a scientific consensus and specifies the urgent measures policymakers must enact to shield humankind—and the planet we depend on—from an accelerating climate threat. In short, this group proclaims that it understands scientific knowledge from “scientific consensus” and any group presenting physical evidence contradicting them should be punished. This organization produced another report titled: “Information Integrity about Climate Science: A Systematic Review.” It claims that [citations omitted here but in report, boldface added]: “The United Nations (UN) has played an important role in placing the issue of information integrity on public and policy agendas, including for the area of climate change. In 2024, the United Nations Global Principles for Information Integrity were presented; that year also witnessed the launch of the Global Initiative for Information Integrity on Climate Change, spearheaded by Brazil and coordinated through UNESCO. The Global Principles highlighted the need for ‘independent, free and pluralistic media’ around the world as vehicles of information and opinion formation. They also called for more “transparency and research” into whether and how traditional media and online communication platforms maintain information integrity in the public interest. That publication, however, stopped short of offering an explicit or operational definition of information integrity. This consolidated evidence base affirms a scientific consensus and specifies the urgent measures policymakers (see SFP2025.2) must enact to shield humankind— and the planet we depend on—from an accelerating climate threat.” Writing in WUWT, Eric Worrall uncovered a UN Human Rights Council report that calls for punishment of those who oppose abandoning fossil fuels. The summary of the report states: “The present report clarifies States’ international human rights obligations and businesses’ responsibilities to phase out fossil fuels and related subsidies within the current decade. The interlinked, intergenerational, severe and widespread human rights impacts of the fossil fuel life cycle, coupled with six decades of climate obstruction, compel urgent defossilization of our whole economies, for a just transition that is effective, human rights based and transformative in protecting the climate, nature, water and food on which life and health for present and future generations depend.” [Boldface added] For example, Richard Lindzen and William Happer used the scientific method to expose the folly of Net Zero. Are they to be punished for producing physical evidence contradicting the claims of the UN organizations which, for years, have led the effort to abandon fossil fuels which are needed for reliable electricity, heat, and transportation? Do UN bureaucrats and their defenders believe they have the right to determine the truth of scientific principles? The quote of the week is: “No government has the right to decide on the truth of scientific principles.” — Richard Feynman. If misinformation on the causes and extent of climate change becomes a criminal offence, would the UN be a criminal organization? Has the UN become an advocate for causing destitute poverty and starvation (by prohibiting use of artificial fertilizer which produce greenhouse gases)? See links under Defending the Orthodoxy and Defending the Orthodoxy – Bandwagon Science ********************** An Existential Threat? It is commonplace for promoters of fear of climate change to call climate change an existential threat. But what the term means is not clear. Clinical psychologist Andrew Hartz provides an explanation of the use of existential threat. See Article # 1. ********************** DDP Conference: The 23rth annual meeting of the Doctors for Disaster Preparedness will be held in Tucson, Arizona, from July 4 to 6. The program features the 2022 Nobel co-Laureate in Physics John Clauser speaking on “Serious errors and fudges in the IPCC et al.’s global power balance structure, albedo, and climate feedback assessments.” Other noted speakers of interest to TWTW readers include Willie Soon, “Measuring the Earth’s Energy Budget”: Michael Connolly “Balloons in the Air: Revisiting Atmospheric Physics, with Data”; Joe Leimkuhler, “Prospects for the U.S. Petroleum Industry”; Jim Steele “Understanding Natural Climate Dynamics Best Prepares Us for Weather Disasters”; and David Legates “9.5 Weeks: My Time in the White House.” For registration in person or by Zoom see https://aaps.wufoo.com/forms/q1f6wbjr18g6o47/ ********************* SEPP’S APRIL FOOLS AWARD – THE JACKSON It is time for voting on the Annual SEPP’s April Fools Award – the Jackson. The grand prize is a large lump of coal. Last year, the deserving winner of the lump of coal was the US National Science Teaching Association. In 2023, the Association banned the CO2 Coalition from its meeting which the Coalition members paid for and were approved because the CO2 Coalition exhibit pointed out that CO2 is essential for photosynthesis which is the food source of all complex life on Earth. There are many strong candidates for this dubious honor including leaders of US scientific agencies who signed off on questionable reports on climate change. Get your votes in by June 29 with the reason why you recommend that person for the award. Send your vote to Ken@Sepp.org. If you wish, you will be anonymous. The award will be announced at the 43rd annual meeting of the Doctors for Disaster Preparedness on July 5-6. The decision of the judges is final. ********************* Number of the Week: 35,000 MWh needed, 4.6 MWh approved. DEMAND: On June 20, the business day with the longest period of sunlight, the California Independent Systems Operator (CAISO) reported that the demand trend for electricity fell to its lowest point at about 12:30 pm (local time) with a demand of 19,500 MW. About 6:30 pm demand began peaking at 28,000 MW and remained there or above until 10 pm when it slowly fell to 25,000 MW. Except between about 10 am and 3 pm, demand did not go below 22,000 MW. SUPPLY: On the same day, renewables (Solar, Wind, Geothermal, Biomass, Biogas, and Small Hydro) reached a near peak of about 25,000 MW at 8:30 am and remained there or more until 5:30 pm when they fell dramatically to about 7,500 MW at 8 pm where they remained the rest of the evening. When it is functioning solar is the biggest generator at over 18,000 MW with wind second at about 5,000 MW. Large hydro provided an average of about 3,750 MW for the rest of the evening and Nuclear about 2,280 MW. The rest of the electricity came from imports (mostly coal and other fossil fuels), and batteries. The government of California is trying to close its remaining nuclear power plant, small hydro and all fossil fuel power imports and rely on solar, wind, and storage. On the longest business day of the year for sunshine, after 8:00 pm CAISO needed 28,000 MW of power until 10 pm when it slowly fell to 25,000 MW while renewables were delivering 7,500 MW and batteries were delivering between 7,000 and 8,000 MW until 10 pm when they declined. Based on rough calculations, just for that evening (8 pm to midnight) CAISO needed 110,000 MWh of power while renewables delivered 30,000 MWh and the power delivered by large hydro alone was about 14,280 MWh. Thus, taking away nuclear, the shortfall would be about 35,000 MWh. Existing batteries delivered about 27,000 MWh and California just approved the “World’s Largest’ Energy Storage Site” with 4,600 kWh (4.6 MWh) of battery storage with no costs given. If California goes net zero with no nuclear, what will California do on a cold, windless night in January? How will it replenish its batteries? If California cannot deliver the nuclear power needed by the Bonneville Power Administration to supplement its large hydro, will the Administration continue to deliver hydropower to California? According to the US EIA, except for isolated Hawaii, residential electricity prices in California are already the highest in the country. In March, the US national average was 17.11 cents per kilowatt-hour, while in California it was 32.41 cents per kilowatt-hour and Hawaii 41.11.

In that document the leaders of the west said that they needed to invest trillions of dollars across all the value chain, the whole oil and gas value chain.

Santer, Susan Solomon, et al., PNAS, June 16, 2025 [H/t Bernie Kepshire] From the abstract: The physics of the heat-trapping properties of CO were established in the mid-19th century, as fossil fuel burning rapidly increased atmospheric CO levels. To date, however, research has not probed when climate change could have been detected if scientists in the 19th century had the current models and observing network. We consider this question in a thought experiment with state-of-the-art climate models. [SEPP Comment: A thought fantasy, not a thought experiment. The state-of-the-art climate models produce results that are wrong. Why bother with a thought experiment until the state-of-the-art models produce accurate predictions that are supported by physical evidence? Further, in the mid-19th century, Europe was emerging from the Little Ice Age which killed hundreds of thousands from starvation and related diseases. Why would warming be considered harmful to humanity? Finally, the authors cite the early work of Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius but not his 1908 paper which admitted his early work was wrong. But he also misunderstood the chemistry of water vapor, it is not gaseous carbonic acid.] Warning signs on climate flashing bright red: Top scientists By Marlowe Hood, Phys.org, June 19, 2025 Link to paper: Indicators of Global Climate Change 2024: annual update of key indicators of the state of the climate system and human influence By Piers Forster, et al.

Or not, once they see how tiny the effects are in the alarmists’ own calculations. For instance, if we assume climate sensitivity to a doubling of atmospheric CO2 is a 3°C temperature increase, and that the US cuts its emissions right away by 40 percent, by the year 2100 global warming will have been reduced by… 0.06 degrees C. Put that in your thermometer and measure it.

Beijing began building 94.5 gigawatts (GW) of new coal-powered capacity in 2024, in addition to resuming 3.3 GW of suspended projects. This is the highest level of construction in the past 10 years! As recently as May, China deployed the world’s largest fleet of driverless mining trucks to fast-track efficient operations, partially to overcome the challenging conditions of harsh winter weather at the Yimin coal mine in northeastern Inner Mongolia. Oceans absorb 30% of our emissions, driven by a huge carbon pump.

Communicating Better to the Public – Use Yellow (Green) Journalism? A weak wind By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, June 18, 2025 So, what has the Washington Post to say on the quietest hurricane season globally since 1970? Why, it was completely quiet about it. (As it was on “climate” save for a mention of a prediction from the Climate Prediction Center.) Unless you count “This spurt of activity shows no signs of ending for now.” Yes. “This spurt of activity” is actually how they describe the quietest start to a season in more than half a century.

Consequently, our understanding of the microplastics distribution across ocean depths is more limited. Here we synthesize depth-profile data from 1,885 stations collected between 2014 and 2024 to provide insights into the distribution and potential transport mechanisms of subsurface (below about 50-cm depth, which is not usually sampled by traditional practices) microplastics throughout the oceanic water column.

May be hot, maybe not By John Robson, Climate Discussion Nexus, June 18, 2025 Point zero six above 2020? Can they say with a straight face that they’ve measured global temperature comprehensively to that degree of precision? Of course not. We’re not even buying the 0.1, let alone the 2 that followed it. As for that estimated 1850-1900 average, as we’ve said before, if you think we know the temperature for every square foot of what was then the Belgian Congo in 1873, or the mid-Pacific, or for that matter Rome, you are a chump or worse. IRA Incentives Fuel U.S. Solar Manufacturing Surge By Aaron Larson, Power Mag, June 11, 2025 The centerpiece of this revival is the IRA’s comprehensive package of tax incentives designed to rebuild America’s solar supply chain. The domestic content bonus tax credit offers project developers an additional 10% on top of the base 30% investment tax credit (ITC) when they use U.S.-made components. This creates demand-side pull for domestically manufactured solar products. According to U.S. Treasury Department data, more than $196 billion in clean power investments have been announced since the IRA’s passage, demonstrating the market’s strong response to these incentives.

Questioning European Green Kathryn Porter Reviews The Spanish Blackouts Report By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, June 20, 2025 Link to: Should NESO [UK Electrical system operator] be allowed to lower its minimum inertia requirement? By Kathryn Porter, Watt-Logic, June 18, 2025 From Porter: Whether this ambition will be possible even with the dodgy carbon accounting rules is unclear. In the summer months, gas power stations are often turned up by the system operator in order to stabilize the grid, providing important inertia to control voltage across the network. Throughout the summer, NESO has observed unexplained voltage oscillations (which I will discuss in another post – this is being held up by junk frequency data being reported to Elexon which has yet to be corrected, despite Elexon requesting re-submission), including on the day before the Iberian blackout. These oscillations can, in extreme circumstances, cause the type of grid failure that led to the loss of eleven lives on 28 April in Spain and Portugal.

Oh. Not so good? For instance, from way down south we hear that “The initial cost of producing green hydrogen from Australia’s two largest projects will be more than four times the price of rival energy sources, posing a fresh setback for Labor’s bid to deliver a major new export ­industry by 2030 and meet net-zero goals.” And you told us you had it all figured out. Blockbuster: Mark Carney, Mr Net-Zero-Banker himself, now uses oil, gas to make Canada an Energy SuperPower By Jo Nova, Her Blog, June 17, 2025 The US is the world’s top producer of oil at the moment, with 44 billion barrels of oil in reserve. Amazingly Canada has four times as much — or 171 billion barrels of oil in recoverable reserves, says the Telegraph. It’s amazing how stupid rich countries can be — to leave, as Alberta’s premier says, “$9 trillion worth of oil wealth we have in the ground”? Speaking of stupid, perhaps the greatest and saddest irony is that Mark Carney once was the green-extreme Governor of the Bank of England. And while there, he helped tie the UK down in carbon markets and energy transitions that still cripple their economy.

By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, June 18, 2025 “The massive power cut that plunged huge swathes of Spain and Portugal into chaos earlier this year was caused by a miscalculation, the Spanish government has said.” No, Sky, it was not a miscalculation. It was the inevitable result of running the grid mainly on highly variable, low inertia renewables. That in turn was the consequence of deliberate government policy. What will happen then, when Spain has succeeded in finally shutting down all of its gas plants? The Lethal Fog of Clean-Air Hypocrisy By Vijay Jayaraj, CO2 Coalition, June 18, 2025 Why do environmental extremists expect Nairobi, Dhaka or Lagos to skip the rational evolution of energy use that so benefited the lives and economies of the U.K. – and of many other western nations? Why do they think an African mother should wait decades – or forever – to cook without smoke? The answer lies in an elitist worldview that treats energy as a lifestyle choice rather than a lifeline. America as a Reliable Energy Partner By Fred H. Hutchison, Real Clear Energy, June 19, 2025 The statement that drew the fierce rebuttal was that “for fifty years Europe saw Russia as a reliable natural gas supplier… and now there is growing concern that Europe may be headed towards over reliance on liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the United States.” NESO Winter Outlook By Paul Homewood, Not a Lot of People Know That, June 20, 2025 “The National Energy System Operator (Neso), which oversees Britain’s electricity grid, said it would import power from France and other nearby European neighbors this winter to help backstop the network.” Homewood: NESO don’t publish the actual numbers – this will wait till their full Outlook later in the year. But they are projecting around 15 GW of renewables, which looks grossly optimistic. There will be no solar power generated when demand peaks in early evening, and we have regularly seen wind power drop to less than 2 GW. (Biomass, it appears, is included under thermal).

The flashpoint is centered on when large customers seek to bypass conventional transmission planning and cost allocation by co-locating directly with generation sources. That practice, often framed as “behind-the-meter” or “non-network” load development, has raised concerns from grid operators, utilities, and regulators who argue that even ostensibly self-supplied data centers still rely on the broader grid for backup, balancing, and reliability services. [SEPP Comment: Why should consumers who need and maintain the grid full time give access to those who do not maintain it full time?] Meta Deal with Constellation Will Keep Illinois Nuclear Plant Open By Darrell Proctor, Power Mag, June 3, 2025 Alternative, Green (“Clean”) Solar and Wind The Senate Can Do This One Thing to Ensure U.S. Energy Dominance By Neil Chatterjee, Real Clear Energy, June 16, 2025 On the energy front, the benefit of transferability is clear. The ultimate goal of energy tax credits is not to reduce tax burdens, but to help companies bring a larger amount of lower-cost and cleaner energy to the market — benefiting the American people. Cash is often preferable to tax credits in accomplishing that goal. The third policy is all the more relevant given this demand surge: restoring support for solar leasing companies. Solar leasing directly benefits U.S. homeowners by allowing them to install panels on their property with a monthly payment plan instead of swallowing the upfront cost. Not only does rooftop solar drive down consumer electricity costs, but it also gives Americans more independence by helping them to get off the grid and cut their reliance on utility companies.

By Leslie Eastman, Legal Insurrection, June 16, 2025 The greatest oxymoron statement of all time: ‘Renewable Energy’ By Ronald Stein and Roger Caiazza, America Out Loud News, June 16, 2025 Wind and solar projects that generate electricity under favorable weather conditions only exist because of government subsidies that finance these projects. To date, none of the wind and solar projects around the world have ever been financed with private capital, as there is no return on such investments. Claims that renewables are cheaper overlook the costs of backing up those sources when the sun does not shine and the wind does not blow. When included, costs are much higher.

At the bottom of the vogue for this exotic term may be the basic human fear of death. By Andrew Hartz. WSJ, June 16, 2025 TWTW Summary: The clinical psychologist and the founder of the Open Therapy Institute begins with: “So-called existential risks seem to be everywhere. Climate change, artificial intelligence, nuclear war, pandemics and more threaten to return us to nothingness. Most people using this term aren’t consciously evoking the philosophy of Sartre or Camus. Still, they may be drawing on associations with existentialism more than they realize and unconsciously expressing deeper concerns about morality and meaning. In psychoanalysis, it isn’t unusual for a word to have an unconscious double meaning. For example, a patient in therapy might say that she can’t ‘bear’ children. She could consciously mean that she’s unable to get pregnant, while also unconsciously communicating that she can’t stand children. Or a grieving patient who’s struggling to find the right word might say, ‘I’m at a loss.’ Similarly, the word ‘existential’ points to catastrophic global threats, but it also echoes the concerns of existentialist philosophy, which addresses a range of topics from freedom to alienation. But the term is most strongly linked in the public imagination to issues of death and meaning. Saying an issue is ‘existential’ can express that it’s deeply tied to one’s fear of dying and need for purpose. We don’t have to overthink every word we say or hear, but there are signals that a word may have an unconscious double meaning. Therapists tend to think this phenomenon is most likely to occur when a word is used in an odd way—when it’s emotionally charged, when it’s repeated excessively or when it has clear resonance with one’s psychological concerns. The recent political use of the word ‘existential’ seems to check every box. People in the U.S. are shouting about how politics is ‘existential’ at the same time that American society is suffering from a marked crisis of purpose. The term is strange and was used rarely in the past, but its use has been increasing as people have become less able to tolerate the risks and uncertainties of life. Recent events—the pandemic, geopolitical conflicts, the increasing secularization of society—could have triggered Americans’ existential concerns. Perhaps other factors are at play as well. For many, social-media platforms intensify feelings of insignificance. A loneliness epidemic might heighten anxieties about meaning. Distrust of authority can lead to feelings of confusion and insecurity. Whatever the causes, the sense that everything is an existential crisis is likely exacerbated by the increasing emotional fragility of younger generations. A prominent psychological theory, Terror Management Theory, posits that all people have anxiety about their mortality and that they cope with it in predictable ways. A robust body of evidence indicates that when people are reminded of their death, they try to boost their self-esteem, take steps to create a legacy and defend their worldview—be it secular or religious. An extension of this theory is that people cope with anxiety about death by focusing their fears onto something more tangible, such as a current political cause. That cause can then become emotionally loaded with all of their anxiety and distress about mortality. This temporarily makes their anxiety feel more manageable, but it’s likely to contribute to fanaticism and emotional dysregulation around politics. Political causes aimed at tackling ‘existential’ risks are often associated with safety culture. People seem to have an unconscious hope that regulations could protect them from ever dying. Sometimes, these rules and rituals even take on an obsessive-compulsive quality, as if the repetitions will magically stave off unknown risks. Many Covid practices had this flavor.” The author states the most clinicians think that fears of annihilation are fundamental influences on behavior which results in outlooks such as the world is going to be destroyed. He then concludes with: “Often, people come to yearn for an omnipotent state as the means to protect them from all their fears. They imagine total state control to protect them from all the internal feelings they can’t tolerate. Anxieties like this can easily become fodder for authoritarianism. Politics won’t solve our deeper problems. Meaning and purpose have to be found on one’s own, and people must develop ways to manage the uncertainties and risks of life. This can be challenging, but it’s the only path toward fulfillment, wisdom and freedom—to say nothing of mental health.” Subscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.

I’m not rich, but I’ve done ok for myself. Although I’m not sure today’s kids have enough gumption to get off their fat arses and make something of themselves. As the ocean warms, a new study found it’s also changing color https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/environment/article308985125.html Supreme Court Rules Fuel Producers Can Contest California’s Emissions Regulations The 7-2 ruling emphasized that it was not considering the substance of the dispute itself, but solely whether the producers had the legal standing to bring the lawsuit. The justices in a 7-2 ruling overturned a lower court’s decision to throw out the lawsuit by a Valero Energy (VLO.N) subsidiary and fuel industry groups. The lower court had concluded that the plaintiffs lacked the required legal standing to challenge a 2022 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency decision to let California set its own regulations. “The government generally may not target a business or industry through stringent and allegedly unlawful regulation, and then evade the resulting lawsuits by claiming that the targets of its regulation should be locked out of court as unaffected bystanders,” conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote for the majority. What is this? “ If California cannot deliver the nuclear power needed by the Bonneville Power Administration to supplement its large hydro, will the Administration continue to deliver hydropower to California?” I was not aware that CA exported nuclear power to the BPA. “An organization called the International Panel on the Information Environment has produced a report titled: “Facts, Fakes, and Climate Science: Recommendations for Improving Information Integrity about Climate Science.” What a name! Why not just call themselves “The Ministry of Truth”? The government of California is trying to close its remaining nuclear power plant, small hydro and all fossil fuel power imports and rely on solar, wind, and storage. And what is so ridiculous is that even could they manage to do it, it would have no material effect on the level of global emissions. Because California is not a big enough emitter for it to make much difference to the global total. It is utterly crazy how people insist on doing these expensive and completely ineffective things ‘because climate’, when even if the theory is correct, they will make no difference to the climate.

Δ Overall, the index slipped a scant 0.02%, as six pillars lost ground and five pillars advanced. In doing so, the CE 100 pantheon outperformed all of its broader benchmarks, as, for example, the S&P lost 0.5%. Banking names surged the most, adding 3%. LendingClub advanced by 5.3%. The company announced the rollout of its LevelUp Checking. The new offering is designed to help consumers move away from reliance on credit cards, especially given record-high credit card debt, by incentivizing the use of debit with rewards tied to debit spending. Target customers are individuals with high FICO scores (around 725) and high incomes ($125,000 to $130,000) who, despite their earnings, often lack immediate cash and carry substantial credit card debt, CEO Scott Sanborn told PYMNTS CEO Karen Webster. “We’re saying that if rewards are important to you, that’s great, so let’s reward you for good behavior,” Sanborn told Webster in an interview. The new LevelUp Checking product gives members 1% cash back for everyday spending with a LevelUp debit card on grocery and gas, among other key categories. Members who have LendingClub personal loans can also receive 2% cash back for making on-time loan payments from the LevelUp accounts. JPMorgan Chase plans to launch a product called a “deposit token” that will serve as a digital representation of commercial bank money and will be available only to the bank’s institutional clients. The deposit token, dubbed “JPMD,” will provide an alternative to stablecoins and will be closely connected to traditional banking systems. JPMorgan Chase will launch JPMD on Coinbase’s public blockchain, Base. JPMorgan’s stock gained 3.8%. In the Pay and Be Paid segment, up 0.3%, Visa has partnered with licensed stablecoin payments orchestrator Yellow Card to explore stablecoin use cases and opportunities across the African markets in which Yellow Card is licensed to operate. Together, the companies will seek opportunities to help streamline treasury operations and enhance liquidity management as well as test integration opportunities with Visa Direct to investigate cross-border payment options, Visa said. Visa’s stock lost 4%. But buy now, pay later names were higher, marked by Sezzle’s 10% rally and Affirm’s 5% boost. As PYMNTS reported, Affirm has announced a new revolving pass-through loan sale facility in which PGIM Fixed Income, a Prudential Financial company, will invest up to $3 billion over 36 months by purchasing up to $500 million of Affirm loans at any one time. This facility, which marks an expansion of the companies’ existing capital partnership, will support Affirm’s offering of pay-over-time options to consumers, the companies said. The Be Well sector led declining stocks, losing 2.5%. Peloton dipped by 11%, trading lower since news earlier this month that Peloton introduced its own peer-to-peer resale marketplace, Repowered. Users can list their pre-owned equipment and accessories from the connected fitness company on the Repowered platform. Sellers determine the listing price, aided by a generative artificial intelligence (AI) tool. In the Enablers group, which lost 0.3%, OpenAI’s Sam Altman has reportedly accused Meta of offering nine-figure signing bonuses to poach his workers. Shares gave up 0.7%. Amazon’s stock lost 1.1%. In a message penned by CEO Andy Jassy, and as reported by PYMNTS, employees who have learned how to use AI will be better positioned to be a part of Amazon in the future. Jassy added that Amazon’s total corporate workforce is likely to shrink over the next few years as the company adopts AI. “Those who embrace this change, become conversant in AI, help us build and improve our AI capabilities internally and deliver for customers, will be well-positioned to have high impact and help us reinvent the company,” Jassy said in the message.

Cookies help us display personalized product recommendations and ensure you have great shopping experience. Accept X Since we took over Smart Data Collective, we’ve made it a priority to focus on how artificial intelligence influences the practical side of data mining. You often hear about machine learning in broad strokes, but we aim to look at how these tools handle the messy reality of raw data. You can’t overstate the damage poor data quality causes. It is estimated by IBM that this issue costs U.S. businesses over $3.1 trillion every year. Keep reading to learn more. There are many ways AI helps clean up large datasets, especially in eliminating duplicates, correcting formats, and filling in gaps. You might have hundreds of spreadsheets from various sources, but AI can bring consistency to it all. You save hundreds of hours compared to doing it manually. It is easy to forget how quickly companies have scaled up their spending on AI tools. CNBC reports that Meta, Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft alone plan to spend up to $320 billion on AI and datacenter infrastructure in 2025. You can see how high the stakes have become when tech giants place that much of their budget behind it. There are not many industries left untouched by this trend. You might assume only tech companies are involved, but even traditional sectors are leaning on AI for their data work. There are organizations earning over $500 million a year, and according to Computer Weekly, they’re putting 5% of their revenue into AI projects. You often need advanced tools just to keep up with the amount of data modern businesses generate. It is not just about cleaning and sorting—AI also helps find patterns in customer behavior, supply chains, and market trends. You can build models that predict when people are most likely to make a purchase or when a part in a machine is likely to fail. There are no shortcuts, but AI brings new power to long-standing business challenges. I still remember the first time I tried to scrape data from a website for a project. I was hunched over my laptop, wrestling with Python scripts, cursing at broken CSS selectors, and wondering if the website’s layout would change before I could even finish my code. Fast forward to today, and the world of data extraction has been completely flipped on its head. The rise of AI web scrapers has not only made my life easier, but it’s also reshaping how entire data teams work—making data more accessible, workflows more efficient, and headaches a lot less frequent. Let’s be honest: the sheer volume of data online is exploding. In 2024, the world created about 149 zettabytes of data, and that number is expected to hit 181 zettabytes by 2025. With 97% of businesses investing in big data and 81% saying data is at the heart of decision-making, the pressure on data teams to deliver timely, high-quality web data has never been higher. But traditional scraping tools just can’t keep up. Enter the age of AI web scrapers—where automation, context-awareness, and accessibility are changing the rules for everyone. So, what exactly is an AI web scraper? Unlike the old-school scrapers that rely on brittle CSS selectors or XPath rules, AI web scrapers use natural language processing, computer vision, and pattern recognition to “read” web pages more like a human would. Instead of telling the tool, “Go grab the third <td> in this table,” you can just say, “Extract product names, prices, and ratings from this page,” and let the AI figure out the rest. What’s really exciting is the rise of AI agents—these are smart automation bots that can interpret your instructions, adapt to different websites, and even handle dynamic content or subpages. Tools like Thunderbit are leading the way here, making it possible for non-technical users (like sales teams, marketers, or real estate analysts) to scrape clean, structured data in just a couple of clicks. No more late-night debugging sessions or praying that your script survives the next website redesign. Having spent years in the trenches with Python scripts and selector-based tools, I can tell you: traditional web scraping is a slog. Tools like Oxylabs, Bright Data API, Octoparse, and ParseHub all require you to set up extraction rules for each website. That means: And let’s not forget the skill gap. Most traditional scrapers require at least some coding chops, which means business users are stuck waiting for the data team to build or fix things. It’s a bottleneck that slows everyone down. Let’s break it down: building a robust scraper for a single site can take hours or even days. Maintenance is an ongoing battle—one small change in the HTML and your whole pipeline can grind to a halt. Add in the need for proxies, anti-bot measures, and infrastructure for scaling, and suddenly your “quick script” is a full-blown engineering project. And the kicker? All that effort is just to keep the data flowing. If you’re dealing with dozens or hundreds of sites, the maintenance alone can eat up a huge chunk of your team’s time and budget. Here’s where AI web scrapers really shine. By leveraging natural language processing and visual analysis, these tools automate the whole data extraction process. You don’t need to know HTML, CSS, or even what a selector is. Just describe what you want, and the AI agent takes care of the rest. This shift is huge for data teams. Instead of spending hours configuring and maintaining scripts, you can set up a new extraction in minutes. And because the AI understands context, it’s much more resilient to changes in website layout or dynamic content. I’ve seen firsthand how much easier things get with tools like Thunderbit. You just click “AI Suggest Fields,” let the AI read the page, and then hit “Scrape.” That’s it. No more wrestling with selectors or worrying about whether the site uses infinite scroll. The AI figures out what’s important, structures the data, and even handles subpages or dynamic elements. It almost feels like cheating—but in the best way possible. Let’s sum up the big wins: This is my favorite part. With traditional tools, you’d need a custom script for every site. But with AI web scrapers, a single tool can generalize across multiple websites. That means faster project turnaround, less repetitive work, and more time spent on analysis instead of data wrangling. For example, Thunderbit’s AI can scrape product listings from Amazon, property data from Zillow, or contact info from niche directories—all with the same workflow. That’s a game plan for scaling up your data operations without scaling up your headaches. Let’s get concrete. Here are some scenarios where AI web scrapers are making a real difference for data teams: For more on these use cases, check out Thunderbit’s blog. Dynamic websites used to be the bane of every scraper’s existence. JavaScript-loaded content, infinite scroll, pop-ups—traditional tools would choke or require complex workarounds. AI web scrapers, on the other hand, can mimic human browsing, interact with dynamic elements, and adapt to layout changes on the fly. This resilience means less downtime, fewer maintenance emergencies, and a lot less stress for data teams. It’s like having a super-adaptable assistant who never complains about late-night website redesigns. Thinking about making the switch? Here’s how I’d approach it: For a step-by-step guide, check out How to Scrape Any Website Using AI. Looking ahead, I see AI web scrapers getting even smarter and more integrated into business workflows. We’re talking about: The bottom line? Data teams will spend less time on extraction and more time on strategy, analysis, and decision-making. The rise of AI web scrapers is more than just a technological upgrade—it’s a shift in how data teams operate. We’re moving from manual, brittle, and high-maintenance workflows to a world where automation, adaptability, and accessibility are the norm. If your team is still stuck in the old world of manual scripts and selector headaches, it’s time to take a look at what AI web scrapers can do. Tools like Thunderbit are making it easier than ever to turn the web into your personal data warehouse—no code, no stress, just results. Ready to see what’s possible?

Title: Geopolitical Market Risk: Israel-Iran War & Oil

More impact oil supply and thus choke global economic growth. This piece examines the impact of past geopolitical events on markets and the potential US economic implications of the Israel-Iran conflict. Vector illustration Beyond the obvious humanitarian tragedy that surrounds any armed conflict, the Israel-Iran war has crucial possible implications for the global economy. With the U.S. striking Iranian nuclear sites, there is a concern that a spreading conflict could impact oil supply and thus choke global economic growth. This piece will examine the impact of past geopolitical events on markets and the potential implications of the Israel-Iran conflict. When Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990, there were some similar concerns to today. The S&P 500 was down 3.3% in the week following and took months to recover. By the following year, stocks were over 10% higher. The backdrop was quite different from today, though, with the U.S. in the midst of a recession and the Savings & Loan crisis. To be clear, even though they are luckily in the minority, there are events like World War II or September 11, where markets are significantly lower a year after the initiation of hostilities. Stock Performance After 29 Major Geopolitical Events Since the start of the current Israel-Iran hostilities on June 13, the S&P 500 has been 1.2% lower. Stocks were little changed last week. The S&P 500 is 2.9% below its mid-February high, having declined by almost 20%. The Magnificent 7, comprising Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), has recovered to 8.7% below its mid-December level. Market Returns Since the war began on June 12, the price of WTI crude oil has increased by 10.1%. Since energy, with oil being a significant part of that mix, is a key fuel for all economic growth, past spikes in oil prices have been associated with economic downturns. On the surface, the increase in prices does not seem extreme enough to collapse economic activity. The price remains well below the 2022 spike on both a nominal and, more importantly, inflation-adjusted basis. Oil Prices Notably, the U.S. and the world have become much more efficient in the utilization of energy. This improved efficiency has translated into a lower proportion of consumer spending allocated to energy, even at the same oil price. In other words, consumers are less negatively affected by oil price increases than in the past. Percent Of Total Spending On Energy To be clear, higher oil prices are still felt by the consumer. One need only think back to the adverse reaction to high gasoline prices in 2022 to prove the point. Furthermore, like tariffs, the higher oil and gasoline prices weigh more heavily on lower-income households than on higher-income households, as they spend a larger percentage of their income on energy. US Retail Gasoline Prices Fracking changed the story of U.S. oil production more than many appreciate. U.S. domestic oil production began to decline in the 1970s and reached its lowest point in 2008. Since then, fracking has led to production surging to all-time highs. US Domestic Crude Oil Production The U.S. has now become the Saudi Arabia of oil. While Saudi Arabia’s share of the global crude oil production has remained reasonably constant at around 12%, the U.S. has increased from providing about 8% of the global oil supply to over 20%. Share Of Global Crude Oil Production In the past, the automatic answer was that the U.S. economy suffered a net loss when oil prices were higher. Consider that without significant domestic production, the U.S. economy was primarily seeing higher prices without benefiting from the oil price increase. With the surge in U.S. production, the increase in oil prices is likely to be neutral for the U.S. economy. This less U.S. economic harm isn’t to imply that a spike in oil prices would be an optimal situation for the economy or markets. Consider higher oil prices as a general reallocation of profits from other industries to the energy sector. This profit reallocation is not typically healthy for overall stock market performance. Economic Impact Of US Oil Production The recent release of U.S. household net worth presents a relatively optimistic picture in aggregate, with net worth only slightly below all-time highs. US Household Net Worth: 1Q 2025 While it is correct for pessimists to point to rising U.S. consumer debt levels since the pandemic lows, the ability of households to handle that debt remains at better-than-pre-pandemic levels. US Household Debt Levels Further to rising consumer debt, credit card debt has also increased, but delinquencies remain below pre-pandemic levels. Credit Card Delinquencies Overall, U.S. households are in a reasonable financial position to withstand an increase in oil prices. Much of the positive story relies on the U.S. labor market remaining resilient. There are signs, as indicated by slowing payroll job growth and rising continuing claims for unemployment benefits, that the job situation is deteriorating. As noted previously, a rise in oil prices disproportionately negatively impacts lower-income households, who are already struggling with the elevated inflation of recent years. As expected, the Federal Reserve made no change to short-term interest rates last week. The meeting continued the trend of the central bank holding steady under “elevated” uncertainty about the economic outlook. The updated median estimates from the Fed still call for two rate cuts this year. Under the surface, the forecast showed a considerable difference in opinions among members, with seven expecting no cuts in 2025 and ten forecasting two or more cuts. To underscore the lack of confidence in the outlooks, Chair Powell said, “No one holds these rate paths with a great deal of conviction.” Markets currently expect two 0.25% Fed cuts in 2025, consistent with the median Fed projection. There is little chance of a cut in July. Instead, the first move lower in 2025 is expected in September. Number Of Expected Fed Rate Cuts The betting market priced in slightly higher odds of a recession in 2025 following the beginning of the bombing of Iran. This relatively small increase in recession risk is consistent with the decline in stock prices. Notably, markets currently project a relatively low risk of a U.S. recession, which is consistent with the fundamental health of the U.S. economy and its current resilience to higher oil prices. Betting Odds Of 2025 US Recession The primary economic risk of the Israel-Iran conflict is the potential threat to oil supplies, which could lead to significantly higher oil prices. Higher oil prices are a headwind to global growth. While higher oil prices are a significant drag on many sectors within the U.S. economy, the profits from U.S. oil production provide a positive offset. Within industries, high energy prices reallocate profits from other sectors to the energy sector. Stocks within the energy sector tend to outperform when oil prices rise and underperform when they fall. S&P 500 Energy Sector Relative Performance Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway has a significant allocation to energy stocks, which account for approximately 11% of the publicly traded stock portfolio, compared to a little over 3% of the S&P 500. Berkshire controls almost 27% of the outstanding shares in Occidental Petroleum (OXY), which, combined with its Chevron (CVX) position, results in a significant overweight in the energy sector. A deeper analysis of the probable reasons behind the Occidental purchase can be found here. Buffett has noted that energy investments are a bet on oil prices over the long term. Based on past geopolitical conflicts, investors should be prepared for pressure on stocks at the start of any widening conflict. While the timing is always unclear, stocks have rebounded as the uncertainty surrounding the events waned. If energy stocks aren’t already part of their diversified portfolio, investors should consider allocating some portion of their portfolio to energy stocks. The energy sector is expected to benefit from rising oil prices, providing some offset to the pressure on other industries.

REWIND and PLAY I never used Jane myself back in the day, or for that matter any 128 native word processor, and even when we got a 128 I still wrote my term papers in Pocket Writer 64 or Timeworks Word Writer. However, that faulty but repairable Australian Commodore 128DCR I got last Christmas came with a big box of software and in there was a complete copy of Jane 128 along with the data disk the previous owners' family had used. They were delighted when I said I wanted to take a whack at converting their files as a thank you — and along the way we'll take a look at Jane's oddball history, the original Apple II version, the Commodore 128 version and its all-but-unknown port to the French Thomson MO5, plus those other attempts at productivity applications Commodore tried in the mid-1980s. PETs, of course, had many productivity software options and even the VIC-20, if suitably upgraded, could manage basic tasks. Some small businesses reportedly even used them for simple finances. The 64 itself was hardly an ideal productivity machine when introduced in 1982, but it was certainly far more up to the task than the VIC-20 was and many such software packages were naturally available later on. Initially, however, dealers and customers openly groused about the absence of a spreadsheet or even a word processor, much to Commodore chief Jack Tramiel's profound displeasure. The task of rectifying this situation was handed to executive Sigmund Hartmann and his recently consolidated Commodore Software division, formed in April 1983 from the prior two separate software units handling system software (under Paul Goheen) and games (under Bill Wade). At least one side project would become critical to the reworked division. Engineer John Feagans had been the initial developer of the PET Kernal, its internal ROM-based operating system, which pioneered the then-novel idea of separating I/O and other system routines from the built-in Microsoft BASIC. (Prior versions of BASIC on early microcomputers often simply drove devices directly.) Feagans' innovation facilitated the use of these routines by user-written machine language programs through a standardized jump table, which was reused and greatly expanded by Bob Russell for the VIC-20 and 64. Feagans' side project was a PET demonstration of a small picture-based file manager, using an office filing cabinet as its central metaphor and drawn with PETSCII graphic characters. In 1982 the Commodore office in Moorpark, California where Feagans worked was closed and he was reassigned to their then-executive offices in Santa Clara. With little else to do at the time, Feagans rewrote his file cabinet demo for the new 64 to get familiar with the hardware, primarily in BASIC. As an exploration of the 64's joystick and moveable sprite capabilities, he additionally implemented an animated "hand" controlled by the joystick that served as a pointer. By this time Hartmann had just weeks until Summer CES in June 1983, the deadline he had promised Tramiel. While working on licensing deals with outside firms, Hartmann also ordered Andy Finkel, promoted from the VIC team to technical manager, to find anything the software division was already working on that could get finished fast. Finkel saw Feagans' new demo and convinced Hartmann that it was both feasible and viable as a product. Magic Desk was completed by Feagans, Finkel and other Commodore developers at record speed, recruiting resources from Rich Wiggins' speech group in Dallas, Texas and marketing and documentation head Michael Tomczyk, who in turn brought in artist and programmer Jeff Bruette to develop the sprite-based icons and additional PETSCII backgrounds. With time being a severely limited resource, after completion of the typewriter and filing cabinet it was instead decided that this Magic Desk would be the first of a whole line of Magic Desk software between which data could be exchanged. This was Magic Desk I: Type & File, and it made it to CES along with almost 70 other programs for the 64 and VIC-20. "We want everyone to know that Commodore's in the software business," Hartmann declared to COMPUTE!'s Gazette. Like many Commodore Software titles Magic Desk was released on cartridge, a wise decision as it started up within seconds, and its interface was colourful, audacious and unlike anything else at that year's CES. (At the time Feagans claimed never to have seen the Apple Lisa or Xerox PARC machines when he developed it, though his recollection later varied.) As a result it quickly overshadowed the software division's other C64 productivity titles licensed from outside companies, such as Easy Script from British developer Precision Software Ltd which débuted at the same show. When it eventually emerged for sale in the fall, however, reviewers were somewhat less enamoured. Although the user-friendly appearance was praised, RUN found the hand pointer difficult to manipulate and complained "the Help screens [were] little or no help," and Ahoy! noted the file cabinet required a disk drive and the questionable use of RELative files for storage, slowing access and hampering interchange. Reviewers also were quick to notice the icons for later planned Magic Desk modules, nevertheless already on the desktop yet programmed to do absolutely nothing. But the most unanimous and direct criticism came for what few built-in applications there were, especially the centrepiece typewriter which was seen as limited and idiosyncratic — and moreso given Magic Desk initially sold for $71.95 (in 2025 dollars over $230) at a time when other, better and often cheaper options had since become available, including from Commodore themselves. InfoWorld was the harshest of its detractors, concluding, "We really question whether Commodore's approach with Magic Desk is the best way to develop 'people literacy.'" Part of this cost was the expense of manufacture. Magic Desk initially came as 32K of ROM in four 8K chips, quite possibly the largest cartridge developed for the 64 at that time and requiring additional logic on the PCB for bank switching. (Its design is still used to this day for large multicarts, now supporting as much as a megabyte of ROM.) Internally, although some code had been converted to machine language using a custom compiler, there wasn't enough time to do it all and a fair portion of Magic Desk thus remained written in BASIC (moved up to start at $0a01 instead of $0801). As part of initialization this BASIC program is read out of the ROMs and copied to RAM for execution, which is the slight pause at the beginning before the title screen appears. Despite the cool press reception, Magic Desk sold surprisingly well to new 64 users, and in numbers sufficient to solve its production problems such that its price dropped in half by late 1984. Sales were enough to propose an upgraded version called Magic Desk II for Commodore's new (and, ultimately to its detriment, incompatible) 264 series, capable of speech prompts when paired with the speech group's Magic Voice synthesizer hardware, and featuring a more sophisticated interface with "Lisa-like" pulldown menus and icons. At the same time the software division finished the remaining pieces of the original 64 Magic Desk (now simply called "The Magic Desk"), also with speech capability; the screenshots here of the presumably completed budget and phone modules are from prototype ROMs in an auction lot of Feagans' old Commodore memorabilia, double the size of the original version. Commodore intended the upper-tier 264s to be home and small business productivity systems, designing their hardware and TED video chip to match, with the 64 remaining as their general purpose gaming and home computer. Tramiel strongly believed, as Michael Tomczyk wrote in The Home Computer Wars, that "home computers would have the power of small business computers like IBM and Apple — but would be priced like home computers, perhaps as low as under $500." Smaller versions of the 264, with their much lower part counts, could even compete in the ultra-low market segment against systems like the ZX series in the UK. As Hartmann, Tomczyk and others in the software group felt the 264 would be most meaningful with built-in software, Magic Desk II became one of several possible option ROMs representing potential machine configurations, along with others featuring different programming languages or applications like a spreadsheet or terminal program. Tramiel embraced the idea, seeing it as a car with different models "just like General Motors." At least three "flavours," aligning with the internal groups in the software division (business, home and education), were envisioned — though the concept also met swift resistance from dealers and even Commodore's own sales team who protested having to handle multiple different versions of one computer. (One possible unspoken reason is that it was already known not to be 64 compatible, and dealers were undoubtedly unhappy about taking stock space away from a financial anchor.) With time yet again a factor, for the top-end "business flavour" the software division looked for a quick potential port and found it in Trilogy, a forthcoming 64 software package from Orange County, California-based Tri Micro demonstrated at Spring Comdex 1983. Trilogy was to be a combination of three existing Tri Micro programs, Your Home Office (word processor and spreadsheet) and The Write File (word processor and database) merged into a single application, and Plus Graph (charting) — what would have been called "integrated software" in those days. Commodore contracted with David Johnson, its developer and Tri Micro's VP of software engineering, to also port it to the 264. In January 1984 Jack Tramiel was forced out of the company he founded by chairman Irving Gould and shortly thereafter the 264 line was slashed by new CEO Marshall Smith. Three models were chosen from the various prototypes and experiments, the 16K 16 (and in Europe the 116 as well) to serve as the low-end, and the 64K 264, now renamed the Plus/4, as the high-end. Both the completed Magic Desk and Magic Desk II were cut, as was the education flavour based on a built-in Logo implementation. Only the Plus/4 would offer Trilogy, renamed to 3-Plus-1, and its ROM size was cut to 32K to reduce production costs further which in turn forced Johnson to make serious reductions in functionality. As a result 3-Plus-1 became nearly as maligned as the Plus/4 itself (mocked in the press as the "Minus/60" for its idiosyncrasies, deliberately incompatible ports and lack of 64 software compatibility), though yours truly actually used the spreadsheet for a household budget when I was a starving student, and it wasn't that bad. Nevertheless, as evidence of the hasty last-minute switch, the Plus/4 manual still makes vague reference to "built-in software packages," saying the computer will tell you "which packages are available and which function key to use to activate them." There was only ever one in the production model, and it was 3+1. As Tri-Micro had still maintained the rights, Trilogy was subsequently released in its original form for the 64 as Team-Mate to the rave reviews 3-Plus-1 never got (in July 1985 RUN called it "a high-performance program that Commodore users will discover to be one of the best available"). Johnson later got his chance to show what 3+1 was really capable of with Plus/Extra, a full disk version sold by Tri Micro, but it lacked the close integration of both Team-Mate and 3+1 and ended up tainted in the market by its predecessor. Commodore never adopted it. The failure of the Plus/4 to succeed the 64, much less overtake it, demonstrated clearly to Commodore management that 64 compatibility was essential in their next computer. Around this same time Sig Hartmann had noted the success of Atari's own first-party software unit Atarisoft on non-Atari platforms (though AtariLab was developed externally), even for the 64, and said there were similar plans to port Commodore first-party software and licenses to the Apple II, IBM PC and PCjr. (NARRATOR: This didn't happen.) However, by mid-1984 the software division had also developed a reputation for poor quality, with Scott Mace commenting in InfoWorld that — hits like International Soccer notwithstanding — "so far, the normal standard for Commodore software is mediocrity." In the meantime, Tramiel had bought the ailing Atari from Warner Communications and lured several Commodore managers, including Hartmann (who was already in conflict with Smith over cuts to the software division), to defect. Paul Goheen, the former systems software group head, became the new software chief. As the Commodore 128 neared completion, management constructed a new sales strategy to put it head to head against the Apple IIc and PCjr in specialty stores as well as Tramiel's favoured mass market retailers. To more plausibly bill it as a productivity machine, once again the software division had to look outside the company. Arktronics started in the dorms of the University of Michigan as a partnership between sophomore Robert "Bobby" Kotick and junior Howard Marks, who were then roommates. "We knew that unlike other industries," said Kotick in a 1984 interview, "there was a place for 19 and 20 year olds [in computers]." In July 1983 the company was formed to capitalize on Marks' ideas to envision a friendlier user interface for productivity applications. Marks, who was French, had previously worked for Apple and had access to its peripherals, including the then-novel use of a mouse as a pointer device. "This was way before there was ever a Lisa," Kotick added. "We realized that the biggest problem was that people like us couldn't use these things [computers] yet because they were too difficult and time-consuming to learn." They crafted a wish list and design document oriented to systems with 64K of RAM or less but featuring a picture (now we'd say icon-based) interface driven by a pointing device, such as a joystick or mouse, and an extensive on-line tutorial. Marks and Kotick hired students and even lured away some professors to work on the application, christened Jane after the Dick and Jane introductory reading books, who accepted shares in the company in lieu of salary. To fund development by their team of about thirty, Kotick tagged along with a friend to the annual Cattle Baron's Ball in Dallas at which he met real estate and casino investor Steve Wynn. Kotick managed to hitch a ride back to the East Coast on Wynn's plane where he pitched him on their company and Wynn encouraged him to write up a business plan. Three months later Marks and Kotick were summoned to Wynn's offices in Manhattan and flown to Atlantic City, whereupon Wynn handed them a cheque for $300,000 (in 2025 approximately $970,000) in exchange for a third of the company, providing business advice as the product progressed. Jane missed a first deadline for Comdex in December 1983 due to testing delays and finally launched at Softcon in February 1984 for the Apple II/II+ with 64K and the IIe at an MSRP of $295 [$920], later reduced to $179 [$560]. The program shipped on three colour-coded floppies, a grey bootable "systems disk" containing the word processor, database and spreadsheet applications (Janewrite, Janelist and Janecalc, respectively), a yellow "help disk" with the tutorial, and a black "data disk" for the user to save files. To ease the need for disk swapping, it would hunt for the right disk in either disk drive if you had two. Versions for the IBM PC and Atari 8-bits were said to be in progress. The initial release was uniquely accompanied by its own single-button mouse (Instagram link), a lower-cost unit — Kotick admitted settling for "a lesser quality product" — manufactured under contract by joystick maker Wico and incompatible with Apple's own later mouse options. This mouse interfaced to the Apple with a custom card and an 8-pin connector. Jane's appearance at the show attracted attention from another Steve, but at the Apple booth instead: Steve Jobs. Jobs visited the company in Ann Arbor and, suitably impressed, told Kotick and Marks they were wasting their time in college. Kotick duly dropped out to concentrate on the company, much to the consternation of his parents. Because it was intended to run on any existing Apple II with sufficient RAM, pretty much nothing was assumed about the hardware. It displayed strictly in monochrome and used the Apple hi-res mode to display upper and lowercase since the II/II+'s text mode was purely uppercase. Additionally, as 80-column capability wasn't universal, it used a software text shaper to display 60-column text in the word processor and, here, in the file requester. Basic windows like these, with title and information in the actual window bars, served for dialogue boxes and file selection. Although no emulator presently supports Jane's oddball original mouse, the PBS MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour did a piece on Arktronics in 1984 (the photo above of Marks and an open Apple II case is from this clip) and, along with pictures of the Arktronics offices which I've scattered throughout this article, had some screenshots that illustrate its capabilities. Here a document is being edited in Janewrite. You can see close, scroll and size gadgets in the window frame, but interestingly the control to maximize the current window is in the lower right. The top of the screen shows the editing tools (hand pointer, arrow, scissors [cut], camera [copy] and paste jar), icons for the three core apps, and then system-wide icons for on-line help, printing, the file manager, preferences and "STOP" to globally cancel an operation. Across the bottom, beside the window maximize gadget, are tools for adjusting line justification, font style (bold, underline, bold and underline, superscript, subscript), print settings and search. I'll have more to say about all of these when we get to Jane's Commodore port. Document windows could also be moved and resized, and multiple windows from different Jane applications could be open simultaneously. If you hit Control-Reset, a Easter egg briefly flashes on-screen with the names of the Apple II programmers: Mike Lagae, John R. Haggis, Brent Iverson, Jim Poje, Peter Lee, Uwe Pleban, Allen Leibowitz and Ken Roe. Because portability to other, sometimes wildly different, systems was always contemplated, application-level components were written in a high level language and compiled for the target (allegedly an early microcomputer dialect of C), with the graphics and I/O drivers written directly in assembly. With the release of the IIc Arktronics updated the program to support Apple's mouse as well. Reviews of the Apple II version were decidedly mixed. In June 1984, InfoWorld called it "innovative" but also observed that "overbearing use of icons, some slow features, and some awkwardness mar the product, which could benefit from an emphasis on efficiency rather than gimmickry." Down under, Your Computer in November 1984 liked the simple interface and believed it would appeal to undemanding users but criticized the 236-page manual and found the mouse unreliable. "When the mouse works properly, it is good," wrote reviewer Evan McHugh, but "when it doesn't it's the pits." Likewise, although A+'s 1985 review also liked the interface and the fact that multiple windows from each module could be open at once, the magazine also felt that "the individual modules in Jane are not up to professional productivity quality." Perhaps because of the software display, Janewrite "was too slow to respond to the keystrokes of a moderately proficient typist," and Janecalc, equally slow, was also panned as "crippled" because it only supported a 24x20 maximum spreadsheet. "Thank you, Jane," quipped reviewer Danny Goodman, "[l]eave your number at the door." Jane was also billed as available for the Commodore 64, even in contemporary advertising, but COMPUTE!'s Gazette in January 1985 said it was "scheduled to be released for the Commodore 64 by the time you read this. The price is expected to be about $80 [$240]." Interviewed for the article, Marks said that Jane for the 64 was to come as a combination cartridge and disk package, where a "32K plug-in cartridge" would quickly and automatically bring up the system. The article claimed the cartridge would autoboot the applications from (now) just a single floppy plus the data disk, though I suspect the actual configuration was that the cartridge contained the applications and the disk contained the online tutorial, simultaneously furnishing a modicum of both instant access and copy protection. Notably, this version didn't come with its own mouse; Marks said they were working to support third-party mice as well as joystick and "touch pad" (presumably KoalaPad) options instead. Accounting for publishing delays, the Gazette piece would have been written several months prior in the fall of 1984 — after advertisements for the C64 version of Jane had been in multiple periodicals such as Creative Computing and Family Computing claiming you could purchase it already. In fact, the 64 version of Jane would never be released — it was simply cancelled once Commodore paid Arktronics to port it to the 128 and badged it as a Commodore product. As the 128's graphic and sound capabilities are virtually identical to the 64's in 40-column mode, save for the extra colour RAM, the port was relatively straightforward. (At the same time Commodore also rebadged the CP/M-based Perfect Software series from Thorn EMI for the 128, but this was non-exclusive, and their rebranded versions were exactly the same as sold for other CP/M-compatible systems. Goheen promised "comprehensive and professional developer support" for the new computer.) The new Jane could also be made cheaper: since the 128 is capable of autobooting a suitably coded floppy disk in drive 8, the cartridge could be dispensed with and the less expensive three-floppy scheme restored (though the grey disk was now called the "application disk"). A 128-mode 1541 fastloader is used if the new and much faster 1570 or 1571 disk drives aren't detected, though the 1571 still boots Jane noticeably faster than the fastloader. (Parenthetically, a frequent misconception is that the Z80 in the 128 does the boot sector check to start CP/M. In fact, the 8502 does that after the Z80 has already checked the Commodore key isn't down and entered 128 mode. In CP/M's case, the code in the CP/M disk boot sector instructs the 8502 to give control back to the Z80 so it can finish the boot sequence — if this weren't the case, the BASIC BOOT command wouldn't be able to start CP/M. Interestingly, 1581s booting CP/M have a special startup file to keep their own CP/M boot sector in a different location.) Otherwise, Jane 128 openly betrayed its origins on the 64: other than fastbooting with the 1571, which it mostly got for free, and support for the 128's new keys it took no advantage of any other 128 features, in particular no 2MHz support nor true VDC 80-column mode. Although the manual and box copy say using a mouse is supported, only the original 1350 mouse works, which strictly emulates a joystick. All three applications that were in the Apple II version are included. Under the hood the apps are implemented as overlays for a central kernel called JANEGM. Sadly, I didn't see any obvious credits while scanning through the disk files. The manual, which appears to have been written by a third party, insists on camelcasing the apps as JaneWrite, JaneCalc and JaneList even though the rear box copy doesn't distinguish them that way and the Apple II version and Arktronics' own advertising called them Janewrite, Janecalc and Janelist. I'll use the latter here. Commodore also included some official marketing material with the box, hawking their new 1902 monitor (with 80 column mode, which was useless for Jane), 1571 disk drive (which works well with Jane), 1670 Modem/1200 (which Jane doesn't use), 512K REU (which Jane doesn't use either) and the 1350 mouse — which in this photo is somewhat different-appearing than the released 1350/1351, and might have been a mockup. Actually, this system would have been a very nice 128 setup and very similar to the one we'll be using both for real and in VICE. Too bad Jane 128 could use relatively little of it. Both Jane and the Perfect series were demonstrated with the 128 for Winter CES 1985, though Commodore didn't announce MSRPs then for any of them at the time. It eventually emerged later that year for $49.95 [$150]; by the next year some retailers were selling it for as low as $35 [$100], compared to each of the Perfect titles then going for $45 apiece [$130]. Plus, the Perfect titles, being CP/M-based, were bland and text-based and failed to show off the C128's graphics, so Commodore ended up emphasizing Jane more in its contemporary marketing. Booting Jane 128 from the 128DCR's internal 1571 drive with my own 1902 monitor. Although its interface is similar to the Apple II's in broad strokes, Jane 128's most obvious difference is colour. However, there are numerous more subtle UI changes in this version, sufficient for it to be called "Jane 2.0" internally before release. We'll step through them here and in the next set of screenshots because they're an interesting comparison point to modern human interface practice. As with the Apple II, across the top of the screen are the various icons, or what the manual calls "pictures." These were slightly altered for the 128 from the Apple II originals. The blue icons again set the mode of the pointer ("tools") from the hand pointer, the insertion arrow, scissors (cut), camera (copy) and paste jar. The current tool is highlighted. You select a new tool by clicking on it, but you can also use the function keys (CLR/HOME, F1, F3, F5 and F7). By modern conventions Jane's tools are used backwards: instead of selecting a text range and "choosing a tool" (e.g., Command-C for copy) to operate on it, you choose a tool first and with that tool select the text range it operates on. I'll demonstrate this specific functionality in a couple instances, but any verb-object operation in Jane will work this way. (Linguistically, this makes Jane a head-initial language, while most modern GUIs are head-final.) Next to the tools are the main apps, Janewrite (now in purple), Janecalc (in green) and Janelist (in cyan), and next to them in grey are the same standard applets built into the kernel (online help, print dialogue, disk/file manager and setup). Finally, the STOP icon, now a solid red, stops the current app, and can be used to escape some screens, though not all. Unexpectedly it doesn't serve to quit Jane entirely: you just turn the computer off. Jane remembers what app is loaded and doesn't reload the overlay if you exit and re-enter it. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel and thus matching the grey system disk. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. At least one side project would become critical to the reworked division. Engineer John Feagans had been the initial developer of the PET Kernal, its internal ROM-based operating system, which pioneered the then-novel idea of separating I/O and other system routines from the built-in Microsoft BASIC. (Prior versions of BASIC on early microcomputers often simply drove devices directly.) Feagans' innovation facilitated the use of these routines by user-written machine language programs through a standardized jump table, which was reused and greatly expanded by Bob Russell for the VIC-20 and 64. Feagans' side project was a PET demonstration of a small picture-based file manager, using an office filing cabinet as its central metaphor and drawn with PETSCII graphic characters. In 1982 the Commodore office in Moorpark, California where Feagans worked was closed and he was reassigned to their then-executive offices in Santa Clara. With little else to do at the time, Feagans rewrote his file cabinet demo for the new 64 to get familiar with the hardware, primarily in BASIC. As an exploration of the 64's joystick and moveable sprite capabilities, he additionally implemented an animated "hand" controlled by the joystick that served as a pointer. By this time Hartmann had just weeks until Summer CES in June 1983, the deadline he had promised Tramiel. While working on licensing deals with outside firms, Hartmann also ordered Andy Finkel, promoted from the VIC team to technical manager, to find anything the software division was already working on that could get finished fast. Finkel saw Feagans' new demo and convinced Hartmann that it was both feasible and viable as a product. Magic Desk was completed by Feagans, Finkel and other Commodore developers at record speed, recruiting resources from Rich Wiggins' speech group in Dallas, Texas and marketing and documentation head Michael Tomczyk, who in turn brought in artist and programmer Jeff Bruette to develop the sprite-based icons and additional PETSCII backgrounds. With time being a severely limited resource, after completion of the typewriter and filing cabinet it was instead decided that this Magic Desk would be the first of a whole line of Magic Desk software between which data could be exchanged. This was Magic Desk I: Type & File, and it made it to CES along with almost 70 other programs for the 64 and VIC-20. "We want everyone to know that Commodore's in the software business," Hartmann declared to COMPUTE!'s Gazette. Like many Commodore Software titles Magic Desk was released on cartridge, a wise decision as it started up within seconds, and its interface was colourful, audacious and unlike anything else at that year's CES. (At the time Feagans claimed never to have seen the Apple Lisa or Xerox PARC machines when he developed it, though his recollection later varied.) As a result it quickly overshadowed the software division's other C64 productivity titles licensed from outside companies, such as Easy Script from British developer Precision Software Ltd which débuted at the same show. When it eventually emerged for sale in the fall, however, reviewers were somewhat less enamoured. Although the user-friendly appearance was praised, RUN found the hand pointer difficult to manipulate and complained "the Help screens [were] little or no help," and Ahoy! noted the file cabinet required a disk drive and the questionable use of RELative files for storage, slowing access and hampering interchange. Reviewers also were quick to notice the icons for later planned Magic Desk modules, nevertheless already on the desktop yet programmed to do absolutely nothing. But the most unanimous and direct criticism came for what few built-in applications there were, especially the centrepiece typewriter which was seen as limited and idiosyncratic — and moreso given Magic Desk initially sold for $71.95 (in 2025 dollars over $230) at a time when other, better and often cheaper options had since become available, including from Commodore themselves. InfoWorld was the harshest of its detractors, concluding, "We really question whether Commodore's approach with Magic Desk is the best way to develop 'people literacy.'" Part of this cost was the expense of manufacture. Magic Desk initially came as 32K of ROM in four 8K chips, quite possibly the largest cartridge developed for the 64 at that time and requiring additional logic on the PCB for bank switching. (Its design is still used to this day for large multicarts, now supporting as much as a megabyte of ROM.) Internally, although some code had been converted to machine language using a custom compiler, there wasn't enough time to do it all and a fair portion of Magic Desk thus remained written in BASIC (moved up to start at $0a01 instead of $0801). As part of initialization this BASIC program is read out of the ROMs and copied to RAM for execution, which is the slight pause at the beginning before the title screen appears. Despite the cool press reception, Magic Desk sold surprisingly well to new 64 users, and in numbers sufficient to solve its production problems such that its price dropped in half by late 1984. Sales were enough to propose an upgraded version called Magic Desk II for Commodore's new (and, ultimately to its detriment, incompatible) 264 series, capable of speech prompts when paired with the speech group's Magic Voice synthesizer hardware, and featuring a more sophisticated interface with "Lisa-like" pulldown menus and icons. At the same time the software division finished the remaining pieces of the original 64 Magic Desk (now simply called "The Magic Desk"), also with speech capability; the screenshots here of the presumably completed budget and phone modules are from prototype ROMs in an auction lot of Feagans' old Commodore memorabilia, double the size of the original version. Commodore intended the upper-tier 264s to be home and small business productivity systems, designing their hardware and TED video chip to match, with the 64 remaining as their general purpose gaming and home computer. Tramiel strongly believed, as Michael Tomczyk wrote in The Home Computer Wars, that "home computers would have the power of small business computers like IBM and Apple — but would be priced like home computers, perhaps as low as under $500." Smaller versions of the 264, with their much lower part counts, could even compete in the ultra-low market segment against systems like the ZX series in the UK. As Hartmann, Tomczyk and others in the software group felt the 264 would be most meaningful with built-in software, Magic Desk II became one of several possible option ROMs representing potential machine configurations, along with others featuring different programming languages or applications like a spreadsheet or terminal program. Tramiel embraced the idea, seeing it as a car with different models "just like General Motors." At least three "flavours," aligning with the internal groups in the software division (business, home and education), were envisioned — though the concept also met swift resistance from dealers and even Commodore's own sales team who protested having to handle multiple different versions of one computer. (One possible unspoken reason is that it was already known not to be 64 compatible, and dealers were undoubtedly unhappy about taking stock space away from a financial anchor.) With time yet again a factor, for the top-end "business flavour" the software division looked for a quick potential port and found it in Trilogy, a forthcoming 64 software package from Orange County, California-based Tri Micro demonstrated at Spring Comdex 1983. Trilogy was to be a combination of three existing Tri Micro programs, Your Home Office (word processor and spreadsheet) and The Write File (word processor and database) merged into a single application, and Plus Graph (charting) — what would have been called "integrated software" in those days. Commodore contracted with David Johnson, its developer and Tri Micro's VP of software engineering, to also port it to the 264. In January 1984 Jack Tramiel was forced out of the company he founded by chairman Irving Gould and shortly thereafter the 264 line was slashed by new CEO Marshall Smith. Three models were chosen from the various prototypes and experiments, the 16K 16 (and in Europe the 116 as well) to serve as the low-end, and the 64K 264, now renamed the Plus/4, as the high-end. Both the completed Magic Desk and Magic Desk II were cut, as was the education flavour based on a built-in Logo implementation. Only the Plus/4 would offer Trilogy, renamed to 3-Plus-1, and its ROM size was cut to 32K to reduce production costs further which in turn forced Johnson to make serious reductions in functionality. As a result 3-Plus-1 became nearly as maligned as the Plus/4 itself (mocked in the press as the "Minus/60" for its idiosyncrasies, deliberately incompatible ports and lack of 64 software compatibility), though yours truly actually used the spreadsheet for a household budget when I was a starving student, and it wasn't that bad. Nevertheless, as evidence of the hasty last-minute switch, the Plus/4 manual still makes vague reference to "built-in software packages," saying the computer will tell you "which packages are available and which function key to use to activate them." There was only ever one in the production model, and it was 3+1. As Tri-Micro had still maintained the rights, Trilogy was subsequently released in its original form for the 64 as Team-Mate to the rave reviews 3-Plus-1 never got (in July 1985 RUN called it "a high-performance program that Commodore users will discover to be one of the best available"). Johnson later got his chance to show what 3+1 was really capable of with Plus/Extra, a full disk version sold by Tri Micro, but it lacked the close integration of both Team-Mate and 3+1 and ended up tainted in the market by its predecessor. Commodore never adopted it. The failure of the Plus/4 to succeed the 64, much less overtake it, demonstrated clearly to Commodore management that 64 compatibility was essential in their next computer. Around this same time Sig Hartmann had noted the success of Atari's own first-party software unit Atarisoft on non-Atari platforms (though AtariLab was developed externally), even for the 64, and said there were similar plans to port Commodore first-party software and licenses to the Apple II, IBM PC and PCjr. (NARRATOR: This didn't happen.) However, by mid-1984 the software division had also developed a reputation for poor quality, with Scott Mace commenting in InfoWorld that — hits like International Soccer notwithstanding — "so far, the normal standard for Commodore software is mediocrity." In the meantime, Tramiel had bought the ailing Atari from Warner Communications and lured several Commodore managers, including Hartmann (who was already in conflict with Smith over cuts to the software division), to defect. Paul Goheen, the former systems software group head, became the new software chief. As the Commodore 128 neared completion, management constructed a new sales strategy to put it head to head against the Apple IIc and PCjr in specialty stores as well as Tramiel's favoured mass market retailers. To more plausibly bill it as a productivity machine, once again the software division had to look outside the company. Arktronics started in the dorms of the University of Michigan as a partnership between sophomore Robert "Bobby" Kotick and junior Howard Marks, who were then roommates. "We knew that unlike other industries," said Kotick in a 1984 interview, "there was a place for 19 and 20 year olds [in computers]." In July 1983 the company was formed to capitalize on Marks' ideas to envision a friendlier user interface for productivity applications. Marks, who was French, had previously worked for Apple and had access to its peripherals, including the then-novel use of a mouse as a pointer device. "This was way before there was ever a Lisa," Kotick added. "We realized that the biggest problem was that people like us couldn't use these things [computers] yet because they were too difficult and time-consuming to learn." They crafted a wish list and design document oriented to systems with 64K of RAM or less but featuring a picture (now we'd say icon-based) interface driven by a pointing device, such as a joystick or mouse, and an extensive on-line tutorial. Marks and Kotick hired students and even lured away some professors to work on the application, christened Jane after the Dick and Jane introductory reading books, who accepted shares in the company in lieu of salary. To fund development by their team of about thirty, Kotick tagged along with a friend to the annual Cattle Baron's Ball in Dallas at which he met real estate and casino investor Steve Wynn. Kotick managed to hitch a ride back to the East Coast on Wynn's plane where he pitched him on their company and Wynn encouraged him to write up a business plan. Three months later Marks and Kotick were summoned to Wynn's offices in Manhattan and flown to Atlantic City, whereupon Wynn handed them a cheque for $300,000 (in 2025 approximately $970,000) in exchange for a third of the company, providing business advice as the product progressed. Jane missed a first deadline for Comdex in December 1983 due to testing delays and finally launched at Softcon in February 1984 for the Apple II/II+ with 64K and the IIe at an MSRP of $295 [$920], later reduced to $179 [$560]. The program shipped on three colour-coded floppies, a grey bootable "systems disk" containing the word processor, database and spreadsheet applications (Janewrite, Janelist and Janecalc, respectively), a yellow "help disk" with the tutorial, and a black "data disk" for the user to save files. To ease the need for disk swapping, it would hunt for the right disk in either disk drive if you had two. Versions for the IBM PC and Atari 8-bits were said to be in progress. The initial release was uniquely accompanied by its own single-button mouse (Instagram link), a lower-cost unit — Kotick admitted settling for "a lesser quality product" — manufactured under contract by joystick maker Wico and incompatible with Apple's own later mouse options. This mouse interfaced to the Apple with a custom card and an 8-pin connector. Jane's appearance at the show attracted attention from another Steve, but at the Apple booth instead: Steve Jobs. Jobs visited the company in Ann Arbor and, suitably impressed, told Kotick and Marks they were wasting their time in college. Kotick duly dropped out to concentrate on the company, much to the consternation of his parents. Because it was intended to run on any existing Apple II with sufficient RAM, pretty much nothing was assumed about the hardware. It displayed strictly in monochrome and used the Apple hi-res mode to display upper and lowercase since the II/II+'s text mode was purely uppercase. Additionally, as 80-column capability wasn't universal, it used a software text shaper to display 60-column text in the word processor and, here, in the file requester. Basic windows like these, with title and information in the actual window bars, served for dialogue boxes and file selection. Although no emulator presently supports Jane's oddball original mouse, the PBS MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour did a piece on Arktronics in 1984 (the photo above of Marks and an open Apple II case is from this clip) and, along with pictures of the Arktronics offices which I've scattered throughout this article, had some screenshots that illustrate its capabilities. Here a document is being edited in Janewrite. You can see close, scroll and size gadgets in the window frame, but interestingly the control to maximize the current window is in the lower right. The top of the screen shows the editing tools (hand pointer, arrow, scissors [cut], camera [copy] and paste jar), icons for the three core apps, and then system-wide icons for on-line help, printing, the file manager, preferences and "STOP" to globally cancel an operation. Across the bottom, beside the window maximize gadget, are tools for adjusting line justification, font style (bold, underline, bold and underline, superscript, subscript), print settings and search. I'll have more to say about all of these when we get to Jane's Commodore port. Document windows could also be moved and resized, and multiple windows from different Jane applications could be open simultaneously. If you hit Control-Reset, a Easter egg briefly flashes on-screen with the names of the Apple II programmers: Mike Lagae, John R. Haggis, Brent Iverson, Jim Poje, Peter Lee, Uwe Pleban, Allen Leibowitz and Ken Roe. Because portability to other, sometimes wildly different, systems was always contemplated, application-level components were written in a high level language and compiled for the target (allegedly an early microcomputer dialect of C), with the graphics and I/O drivers written directly in assembly. With the release of the IIc Arktronics updated the program to support Apple's mouse as well. Reviews of the Apple II version were decidedly mixed. In June 1984, InfoWorld called it "innovative" but also observed that "overbearing use of icons, some slow features, and some awkwardness mar the product, which could benefit from an emphasis on efficiency rather than gimmickry." Down under, Your Computer in November 1984 liked the simple interface and believed it would appeal to undemanding users but criticized the 236-page manual and found the mouse unreliable. "When the mouse works properly, it is good," wrote reviewer Evan McHugh, but "when it doesn't it's the pits." Likewise, although A+'s 1985 review also liked the interface and the fact that multiple windows from each module could be open at once, the magazine also felt that "the individual modules in Jane are not up to professional productivity quality." Perhaps because of the software display, Janewrite "was too slow to respond to the keystrokes of a moderately proficient typist," and Janecalc, equally slow, was also panned as "crippled" because it only supported a 24x20 maximum spreadsheet. "Thank you, Jane," quipped reviewer Danny Goodman, "[l]eave your number at the door." Jane was also billed as available for the Commodore 64, even in contemporary advertising, but COMPUTE!'s Gazette in January 1985 said it was "scheduled to be released for the Commodore 64 by the time you read this. The price is expected to be about $80 [$240]." Interviewed for the article, Marks said that Jane for the 64 was to come as a combination cartridge and disk package, where a "32K plug-in cartridge" would quickly and automatically bring up the system. The article claimed the cartridge would autoboot the applications from (now) just a single floppy plus the data disk, though I suspect the actual configuration was that the cartridge contained the applications and the disk contained the online tutorial, simultaneously furnishing a modicum of both instant access and copy protection. Notably, this version didn't come with its own mouse; Marks said they were working to support third-party mice as well as joystick and "touch pad" (presumably KoalaPad) options instead. Accounting for publishing delays, the Gazette piece would have been written several months prior in the fall of 1984 — after advertisements for the C64 version of Jane had been in multiple periodicals such as Creative Computing and Family Computing claiming you could purchase it already. In fact, the 64 version of Jane would never be released — it was simply cancelled once Commodore paid Arktronics to port it to the 128 and badged it as a Commodore product. As the 128's graphic and sound capabilities are virtually identical to the 64's in 40-column mode, save for the extra colour RAM, the port was relatively straightforward. (At the same time Commodore also rebadged the CP/M-based Perfect Software series from Thorn EMI for the 128, but this was non-exclusive, and their rebranded versions were exactly the same as sold for other CP/M-compatible systems. Goheen promised "comprehensive and professional developer support" for the new computer.) The new Jane could also be made cheaper: since the 128 is capable of autobooting a suitably coded floppy disk in drive 8, the cartridge could be dispensed with and the less expensive three-floppy scheme restored (though the grey disk was now called the "application disk"). A 128-mode 1541 fastloader is used if the new and much faster 1570 or 1571 disk drives aren't detected, though the 1571 still boots Jane noticeably faster than the fastloader. (Parenthetically, a frequent misconception is that the Z80 in the 128 does the boot sector check to start CP/M. In fact, the 8502 does that after the Z80 has already checked the Commodore key isn't down and entered 128 mode. In CP/M's case, the code in the CP/M disk boot sector instructs the 8502 to give control back to the Z80 so it can finish the boot sequence — if this weren't the case, the BASIC BOOT command wouldn't be able to start CP/M. Interestingly, 1581s booting CP/M have a special startup file to keep their own CP/M boot sector in a different location.) Otherwise, Jane 128 openly betrayed its origins on the 64: other than fastbooting with the 1571, which it mostly got for free, and support for the 128's new keys it took no advantage of any other 128 features, in particular no 2MHz support nor true VDC 80-column mode. Although the manual and box copy say using a mouse is supported, only the original 1350 mouse works, which strictly emulates a joystick. All three applications that were in the Apple II version are included. Under the hood the apps are implemented as overlays for a central kernel called JANEGM. Sadly, I didn't see any obvious credits while scanning through the disk files. The manual, which appears to have been written by a third party, insists on camelcasing the apps as JaneWrite, JaneCalc and JaneList even though the rear box copy doesn't distinguish them that way and the Apple II version and Arktronics' own advertising called them Janewrite, Janecalc and Janelist. I'll use the latter here. Commodore also included some official marketing material with the box, hawking their new 1902 monitor (with 80 column mode, which was useless for Jane), 1571 disk drive (which works well with Jane), 1670 Modem/1200 (which Jane doesn't use), 512K REU (which Jane doesn't use either) and the 1350 mouse — which in this photo is somewhat different-appearing than the released 1350/1351, and might have been a mockup. Actually, this system would have been a very nice 128 setup and very similar to the one we'll be using both for real and in VICE. Too bad Jane 128 could use relatively little of it. Both Jane and the Perfect series were demonstrated with the 128 for Winter CES 1985, though Commodore didn't announce MSRPs then for any of them at the time. It eventually emerged later that year for $49.95 [$150]; by the next year some retailers were selling it for as low as $35 [$100], compared to each of the Perfect titles then going for $45 apiece [$130]. Plus, the Perfect titles, being CP/M-based, were bland and text-based and failed to show off the C128's graphics, so Commodore ended up emphasizing Jane more in its contemporary marketing. Booting Jane 128 from the 128DCR's internal 1571 drive with my own 1902 monitor. Although its interface is similar to the Apple II's in broad strokes, Jane 128's most obvious difference is colour. However, there are numerous more subtle UI changes in this version, sufficient for it to be called "Jane 2.0" internally before release. We'll step through them here and in the next set of screenshots because they're an interesting comparison point to modern human interface practice. As with the Apple II, across the top of the screen are the various icons, or what the manual calls "pictures." These were slightly altered for the 128 from the Apple II originals. The blue icons again set the mode of the pointer ("tools") from the hand pointer, the insertion arrow, scissors (cut), camera (copy) and paste jar. The current tool is highlighted. You select a new tool by clicking on it, but you can also use the function keys (CLR/HOME, F1, F3, F5 and F7). By modern conventions Jane's tools are used backwards: instead of selecting a text range and "choosing a tool" (e.g., Command-C for copy) to operate on it, you choose a tool first and with that tool select the text range it operates on. I'll demonstrate this specific functionality in a couple instances, but any verb-object operation in Jane will work this way. (Linguistically, this makes Jane a head-initial language, while most modern GUIs are head-final.) Next to the tools are the main apps, Janewrite (now in purple), Janecalc (in green) and Janelist (in cyan), and next to them in grey are the same standard applets built into the kernel (online help, print dialogue, disk/file manager and setup). Finally, the STOP icon, now a solid red, stops the current app, and can be used to escape some screens, though not all. Unexpectedly it doesn't serve to quit Jane entirely: you just turn the computer off. Jane remembers what app is loaded and doesn't reload the overlay if you exit and re-enter it. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel and thus matching the grey system disk. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. Feagans' side project was a PET demonstration of a small picture-based file manager, using an office filing cabinet as its central metaphor and drawn with PETSCII graphic characters. In 1982 the Commodore office in Moorpark, California where Feagans worked was closed and he was reassigned to their then-executive offices in Santa Clara. With little else to do at the time, Feagans rewrote his file cabinet demo for the new 64 to get familiar with the hardware, primarily in BASIC. As an exploration of the 64's joystick and moveable sprite capabilities, he additionally implemented an animated "hand" controlled by the joystick that served as a pointer. By this time Hartmann had just weeks until Summer CES in June 1983, the deadline he had promised Tramiel. While working on licensing deals with outside firms, Hartmann also ordered Andy Finkel, promoted from the VIC team to technical manager, to find anything the software division was already working on that could get finished fast. Finkel saw Feagans' new demo and convinced Hartmann that it was both feasible and viable as a product. Magic Desk was completed by Feagans, Finkel and other Commodore developers at record speed, recruiting resources from Rich Wiggins' speech group in Dallas, Texas and marketing and documentation head Michael Tomczyk, who in turn brought in artist and programmer Jeff Bruette to develop the sprite-based icons and additional PETSCII backgrounds. With time being a severely limited resource, after completion of the typewriter and filing cabinet it was instead decided that this Magic Desk would be the first of a whole line of Magic Desk software between which data could be exchanged. This was Magic Desk I: Type & File, and it made it to CES along with almost 70 other programs for the 64 and VIC-20. "We want everyone to know that Commodore's in the software business," Hartmann declared to COMPUTE!'s Gazette. Like many Commodore Software titles Magic Desk was released on cartridge, a wise decision as it started up within seconds, and its interface was colourful, audacious and unlike anything else at that year's CES. (At the time Feagans claimed never to have seen the Apple Lisa or Xerox PARC machines when he developed it, though his recollection later varied.) As a result it quickly overshadowed the software division's other C64 productivity titles licensed from outside companies, such as Easy Script from British developer Precision Software Ltd which débuted at the same show. When it eventually emerged for sale in the fall, however, reviewers were somewhat less enamoured. Although the user-friendly appearance was praised, RUN found the hand pointer difficult to manipulate and complained "the Help screens [were] little or no help," and Ahoy! noted the file cabinet required a disk drive and the questionable use of RELative files for storage, slowing access and hampering interchange. Reviewers also were quick to notice the icons for later planned Magic Desk modules, nevertheless already on the desktop yet programmed to do absolutely nothing. But the most unanimous and direct criticism came for what few built-in applications there were, especially the centrepiece typewriter which was seen as limited and idiosyncratic — and moreso given Magic Desk initially sold for $71.95 (in 2025 dollars over $230) at a time when other, better and often cheaper options had since become available, including from Commodore themselves. InfoWorld was the harshest of its detractors, concluding, "We really question whether Commodore's approach with Magic Desk is the best way to develop 'people literacy.'" Part of this cost was the expense of manufacture. Magic Desk initially came as 32K of ROM in four 8K chips, quite possibly the largest cartridge developed for the 64 at that time and requiring additional logic on the PCB for bank switching. (Its design is still used to this day for large multicarts, now supporting as much as a megabyte of ROM.) Internally, although some code had been converted to machine language using a custom compiler, there wasn't enough time to do it all and a fair portion of Magic Desk thus remained written in BASIC (moved up to start at $0a01 instead of $0801). As part of initialization this BASIC program is read out of the ROMs and copied to RAM for execution, which is the slight pause at the beginning before the title screen appears. Despite the cool press reception, Magic Desk sold surprisingly well to new 64 users, and in numbers sufficient to solve its production problems such that its price dropped in half by late 1984. Sales were enough to propose an upgraded version called Magic Desk II for Commodore's new (and, ultimately to its detriment, incompatible) 264 series, capable of speech prompts when paired with the speech group's Magic Voice synthesizer hardware, and featuring a more sophisticated interface with "Lisa-like" pulldown menus and icons. At the same time the software division finished the remaining pieces of the original 64 Magic Desk (now simply called "The Magic Desk"), also with speech capability; the screenshots here of the presumably completed budget and phone modules are from prototype ROMs in an auction lot of Feagans' old Commodore memorabilia, double the size of the original version. Commodore intended the upper-tier 264s to be home and small business productivity systems, designing their hardware and TED video chip to match, with the 64 remaining as their general purpose gaming and home computer. Tramiel strongly believed, as Michael Tomczyk wrote in The Home Computer Wars, that "home computers would have the power of small business computers like IBM and Apple — but would be priced like home computers, perhaps as low as under $500." Smaller versions of the 264, with their much lower part counts, could even compete in the ultra-low market segment against systems like the ZX series in the UK. As Hartmann, Tomczyk and others in the software group felt the 264 would be most meaningful with built-in software, Magic Desk II became one of several possible option ROMs representing potential machine configurations, along with others featuring different programming languages or applications like a spreadsheet or terminal program. Tramiel embraced the idea, seeing it as a car with different models "just like General Motors." At least three "flavours," aligning with the internal groups in the software division (business, home and education), were envisioned — though the concept also met swift resistance from dealers and even Commodore's own sales team who protested having to handle multiple different versions of one computer. (One possible unspoken reason is that it was already known not to be 64 compatible, and dealers were undoubtedly unhappy about taking stock space away from a financial anchor.) With time yet again a factor, for the top-end "business flavour" the software division looked for a quick potential port and found it in Trilogy, a forthcoming 64 software package from Orange County, California-based Tri Micro demonstrated at Spring Comdex 1983. Trilogy was to be a combination of three existing Tri Micro programs, Your Home Office (word processor and spreadsheet) and The Write File (word processor and database) merged into a single application, and Plus Graph (charting) — what would have been called "integrated software" in those days. Commodore contracted with David Johnson, its developer and Tri Micro's VP of software engineering, to also port it to the 264. In January 1984 Jack Tramiel was forced out of the company he founded by chairman Irving Gould and shortly thereafter the 264 line was slashed by new CEO Marshall Smith. Three models were chosen from the various prototypes and experiments, the 16K 16 (and in Europe the 116 as well) to serve as the low-end, and the 64K 264, now renamed the Plus/4, as the high-end. Both the completed Magic Desk and Magic Desk II were cut, as was the education flavour based on a built-in Logo implementation. Only the Plus/4 would offer Trilogy, renamed to 3-Plus-1, and its ROM size was cut to 32K to reduce production costs further which in turn forced Johnson to make serious reductions in functionality. As a result 3-Plus-1 became nearly as maligned as the Plus/4 itself (mocked in the press as the "Minus/60" for its idiosyncrasies, deliberately incompatible ports and lack of 64 software compatibility), though yours truly actually used the spreadsheet for a household budget when I was a starving student, and it wasn't that bad. Nevertheless, as evidence of the hasty last-minute switch, the Plus/4 manual still makes vague reference to "built-in software packages," saying the computer will tell you "which packages are available and which function key to use to activate them." There was only ever one in the production model, and it was 3+1. As Tri-Micro had still maintained the rights, Trilogy was subsequently released in its original form for the 64 as Team-Mate to the rave reviews 3-Plus-1 never got (in July 1985 RUN called it "a high-performance program that Commodore users will discover to be one of the best available"). Johnson later got his chance to show what 3+1 was really capable of with Plus/Extra, a full disk version sold by Tri Micro, but it lacked the close integration of both Team-Mate and 3+1 and ended up tainted in the market by its predecessor. Commodore never adopted it. The failure of the Plus/4 to succeed the 64, much less overtake it, demonstrated clearly to Commodore management that 64 compatibility was essential in their next computer. Around this same time Sig Hartmann had noted the success of Atari's own first-party software unit Atarisoft on non-Atari platforms (though AtariLab was developed externally), even for the 64, and said there were similar plans to port Commodore first-party software and licenses to the Apple II, IBM PC and PCjr. (NARRATOR: This didn't happen.) However, by mid-1984 the software division had also developed a reputation for poor quality, with Scott Mace commenting in InfoWorld that — hits like International Soccer notwithstanding — "so far, the normal standard for Commodore software is mediocrity." In the meantime, Tramiel had bought the ailing Atari from Warner Communications and lured several Commodore managers, including Hartmann (who was already in conflict with Smith over cuts to the software division), to defect. Paul Goheen, the former systems software group head, became the new software chief. As the Commodore 128 neared completion, management constructed a new sales strategy to put it head to head against the Apple IIc and PCjr in specialty stores as well as Tramiel's favoured mass market retailers. To more plausibly bill it as a productivity machine, once again the software division had to look outside the company. Arktronics started in the dorms of the University of Michigan as a partnership between sophomore Robert "Bobby" Kotick and junior Howard Marks, who were then roommates. "We knew that unlike other industries," said Kotick in a 1984 interview, "there was a place for 19 and 20 year olds [in computers]." In July 1983 the company was formed to capitalize on Marks' ideas to envision a friendlier user interface for productivity applications. Marks, who was French, had previously worked for Apple and had access to its peripherals, including the then-novel use of a mouse as a pointer device. "This was way before there was ever a Lisa," Kotick added. "We realized that the biggest problem was that people like us couldn't use these things [computers] yet because they were too difficult and time-consuming to learn." They crafted a wish list and design document oriented to systems with 64K of RAM or less but featuring a picture (now we'd say icon-based) interface driven by a pointing device, such as a joystick or mouse, and an extensive on-line tutorial. Marks and Kotick hired students and even lured away some professors to work on the application, christened Jane after the Dick and Jane introductory reading books, who accepted shares in the company in lieu of salary. To fund development by their team of about thirty, Kotick tagged along with a friend to the annual Cattle Baron's Ball in Dallas at which he met real estate and casino investor Steve Wynn. Kotick managed to hitch a ride back to the East Coast on Wynn's plane where he pitched him on their company and Wynn encouraged him to write up a business plan. Three months later Marks and Kotick were summoned to Wynn's offices in Manhattan and flown to Atlantic City, whereupon Wynn handed them a cheque for $300,000 (in 2025 approximately $970,000) in exchange for a third of the company, providing business advice as the product progressed. Jane missed a first deadline for Comdex in December 1983 due to testing delays and finally launched at Softcon in February 1984 for the Apple II/II+ with 64K and the IIe at an MSRP of $295 [$920], later reduced to $179 [$560]. The program shipped on three colour-coded floppies, a grey bootable "systems disk" containing the word processor, database and spreadsheet applications (Janewrite, Janelist and Janecalc, respectively), a yellow "help disk" with the tutorial, and a black "data disk" for the user to save files. To ease the need for disk swapping, it would hunt for the right disk in either disk drive if you had two. Versions for the IBM PC and Atari 8-bits were said to be in progress. The initial release was uniquely accompanied by its own single-button mouse (Instagram link), a lower-cost unit — Kotick admitted settling for "a lesser quality product" — manufactured under contract by joystick maker Wico and incompatible with Apple's own later mouse options. This mouse interfaced to the Apple with a custom card and an 8-pin connector. Jane's appearance at the show attracted attention from another Steve, but at the Apple booth instead: Steve Jobs. Jobs visited the company in Ann Arbor and, suitably impressed, told Kotick and Marks they were wasting their time in college. Kotick duly dropped out to concentrate on the company, much to the consternation of his parents. Because it was intended to run on any existing Apple II with sufficient RAM, pretty much nothing was assumed about the hardware. It displayed strictly in monochrome and used the Apple hi-res mode to display upper and lowercase since the II/II+'s text mode was purely uppercase. Additionally, as 80-column capability wasn't universal, it used a software text shaper to display 60-column text in the word processor and, here, in the file requester. Basic windows like these, with title and information in the actual window bars, served for dialogue boxes and file selection. Although no emulator presently supports Jane's oddball original mouse, the PBS MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour did a piece on Arktronics in 1984 (the photo above of Marks and an open Apple II case is from this clip) and, along with pictures of the Arktronics offices which I've scattered throughout this article, had some screenshots that illustrate its capabilities. Here a document is being edited in Janewrite. You can see close, scroll and size gadgets in the window frame, but interestingly the control to maximize the current window is in the lower right. The top of the screen shows the editing tools (hand pointer, arrow, scissors [cut], camera [copy] and paste jar), icons for the three core apps, and then system-wide icons for on-line help, printing, the file manager, preferences and "STOP" to globally cancel an operation. Across the bottom, beside the window maximize gadget, are tools for adjusting line justification, font style (bold, underline, bold and underline, superscript, subscript), print settings and search. I'll have more to say about all of these when we get to Jane's Commodore port. Document windows could also be moved and resized, and multiple windows from different Jane applications could be open simultaneously. If you hit Control-Reset, a Easter egg briefly flashes on-screen with the names of the Apple II programmers: Mike Lagae, John R. Haggis, Brent Iverson, Jim Poje, Peter Lee, Uwe Pleban, Allen Leibowitz and Ken Roe. Because portability to other, sometimes wildly different, systems was always contemplated, application-level components were written in a high level language and compiled for the target (allegedly an early microcomputer dialect of C), with the graphics and I/O drivers written directly in assembly. With the release of the IIc Arktronics updated the program to support Apple's mouse as well. Reviews of the Apple II version were decidedly mixed. In June 1984, InfoWorld called it "innovative" but also observed that "overbearing use of icons, some slow features, and some awkwardness mar the product, which could benefit from an emphasis on efficiency rather than gimmickry." Down under, Your Computer in November 1984 liked the simple interface and believed it would appeal to undemanding users but criticized the 236-page manual and found the mouse unreliable. "When the mouse works properly, it is good," wrote reviewer Evan McHugh, but "when it doesn't it's the pits." Likewise, although A+'s 1985 review also liked the interface and the fact that multiple windows from each module could be open at once, the magazine also felt that "the individual modules in Jane are not up to professional productivity quality." Perhaps because of the software display, Janewrite "was too slow to respond to the keystrokes of a moderately proficient typist," and Janecalc, equally slow, was also panned as "crippled" because it only supported a 24x20 maximum spreadsheet. "Thank you, Jane," quipped reviewer Danny Goodman, "[l]eave your number at the door." Jane was also billed as available for the Commodore 64, even in contemporary advertising, but COMPUTE!'s Gazette in January 1985 said it was "scheduled to be released for the Commodore 64 by the time you read this. The price is expected to be about $80 [$240]." Interviewed for the article, Marks said that Jane for the 64 was to come as a combination cartridge and disk package, where a "32K plug-in cartridge" would quickly and automatically bring up the system. The article claimed the cartridge would autoboot the applications from (now) just a single floppy plus the data disk, though I suspect the actual configuration was that the cartridge contained the applications and the disk contained the online tutorial, simultaneously furnishing a modicum of both instant access and copy protection. Notably, this version didn't come with its own mouse; Marks said they were working to support third-party mice as well as joystick and "touch pad" (presumably KoalaPad) options instead. Accounting for publishing delays, the Gazette piece would have been written several months prior in the fall of 1984 — after advertisements for the C64 version of Jane had been in multiple periodicals such as Creative Computing and Family Computing claiming you could purchase it already. In fact, the 64 version of Jane would never be released — it was simply cancelled once Commodore paid Arktronics to port it to the 128 and badged it as a Commodore product. As the 128's graphic and sound capabilities are virtually identical to the 64's in 40-column mode, save for the extra colour RAM, the port was relatively straightforward. (At the same time Commodore also rebadged the CP/M-based Perfect Software series from Thorn EMI for the 128, but this was non-exclusive, and their rebranded versions were exactly the same as sold for other CP/M-compatible systems. Goheen promised "comprehensive and professional developer support" for the new computer.) The new Jane could also be made cheaper: since the 128 is capable of autobooting a suitably coded floppy disk in drive 8, the cartridge could be dispensed with and the less expensive three-floppy scheme restored (though the grey disk was now called the "application disk"). A 128-mode 1541 fastloader is used if the new and much faster 1570 or 1571 disk drives aren't detected, though the 1571 still boots Jane noticeably faster than the fastloader. (Parenthetically, a frequent misconception is that the Z80 in the 128 does the boot sector check to start CP/M. In fact, the 8502 does that after the Z80 has already checked the Commodore key isn't down and entered 128 mode. In CP/M's case, the code in the CP/M disk boot sector instructs the 8502 to give control back to the Z80 so it can finish the boot sequence — if this weren't the case, the BASIC BOOT command wouldn't be able to start CP/M. Interestingly, 1581s booting CP/M have a special startup file to keep their own CP/M boot sector in a different location.) Otherwise, Jane 128 openly betrayed its origins on the 64: other than fastbooting with the 1571, which it mostly got for free, and support for the 128's new keys it took no advantage of any other 128 features, in particular no 2MHz support nor true VDC 80-column mode. Although the manual and box copy say using a mouse is supported, only the original 1350 mouse works, which strictly emulates a joystick. All three applications that were in the Apple II version are included. Under the hood the apps are implemented as overlays for a central kernel called JANEGM. Sadly, I didn't see any obvious credits while scanning through the disk files. The manual, which appears to have been written by a third party, insists on camelcasing the apps as JaneWrite, JaneCalc and JaneList even though the rear box copy doesn't distinguish them that way and the Apple II version and Arktronics' own advertising called them Janewrite, Janecalc and Janelist. I'll use the latter here. Commodore also included some official marketing material with the box, hawking their new 1902 monitor (with 80 column mode, which was useless for Jane), 1571 disk drive (which works well with Jane), 1670 Modem/1200 (which Jane doesn't use), 512K REU (which Jane doesn't use either) and the 1350 mouse — which in this photo is somewhat different-appearing than the released 1350/1351, and might have been a mockup. Actually, this system would have been a very nice 128 setup and very similar to the one we'll be using both for real and in VICE. Too bad Jane 128 could use relatively little of it. Both Jane and the Perfect series were demonstrated with the 128 for Winter CES 1985, though Commodore didn't announce MSRPs then for any of them at the time. It eventually emerged later that year for $49.95 [$150]; by the next year some retailers were selling it for as low as $35 [$100], compared to each of the Perfect titles then going for $45 apiece [$130]. Plus, the Perfect titles, being CP/M-based, were bland and text-based and failed to show off the C128's graphics, so Commodore ended up emphasizing Jane more in its contemporary marketing. Booting Jane 128 from the 128DCR's internal 1571 drive with my own 1902 monitor. Although its interface is similar to the Apple II's in broad strokes, Jane 128's most obvious difference is colour. However, there are numerous more subtle UI changes in this version, sufficient for it to be called "Jane 2.0" internally before release. We'll step through them here and in the next set of screenshots because they're an interesting comparison point to modern human interface practice. As with the Apple II, across the top of the screen are the various icons, or what the manual calls "pictures." These were slightly altered for the 128 from the Apple II originals. The blue icons again set the mode of the pointer ("tools") from the hand pointer, the insertion arrow, scissors (cut), camera (copy) and paste jar. The current tool is highlighted. You select a new tool by clicking on it, but you can also use the function keys (CLR/HOME, F1, F3, F5 and F7). By modern conventions Jane's tools are used backwards: instead of selecting a text range and "choosing a tool" (e.g., Command-C for copy) to operate on it, you choose a tool first and with that tool select the text range it operates on. I'll demonstrate this specific functionality in a couple instances, but any verb-object operation in Jane will work this way. (Linguistically, this makes Jane a head-initial language, while most modern GUIs are head-final.) Next to the tools are the main apps, Janewrite (now in purple), Janecalc (in green) and Janelist (in cyan), and next to them in grey are the same standard applets built into the kernel (online help, print dialogue, disk/file manager and setup). Finally, the STOP icon, now a solid red, stops the current app, and can be used to escape some screens, though not all. Unexpectedly it doesn't serve to quit Jane entirely: you just turn the computer off. Jane remembers what app is loaded and doesn't reload the overlay if you exit and re-enter it. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel and thus matching the grey system disk. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. Part of this cost was the expense of manufacture. Magic Desk initially came as 32K of ROM in four 8K chips, quite possibly the largest cartridge developed for the 64 at that time and requiring additional logic on the PCB for bank switching. (Its design is still used to this day for large multicarts, now supporting as much as a megabyte of ROM.) Internally, although some code had been converted to machine language using a custom compiler, there wasn't enough time to do it all and a fair portion of Magic Desk thus remained written in BASIC (moved up to start at $0a01 instead of $0801). As part of initialization this BASIC program is read out of the ROMs and copied to RAM for execution, which is the slight pause at the beginning before the title screen appears. Despite the cool press reception, Magic Desk sold surprisingly well to new 64 users, and in numbers sufficient to solve its production problems such that its price dropped in half by late 1984. Sales were enough to propose an upgraded version called Magic Desk II for Commodore's new (and, ultimately to its detriment, incompatible) 264 series, capable of speech prompts when paired with the speech group's Magic Voice synthesizer hardware, and featuring a more sophisticated interface with "Lisa-like" pulldown menus and icons. At the same time the software division finished the remaining pieces of the original 64 Magic Desk (now simply called "The Magic Desk"), also with speech capability; the screenshots here of the presumably completed budget and phone modules are from prototype ROMs in an auction lot of Feagans' old Commodore memorabilia, double the size of the original version. Commodore intended the upper-tier 264s to be home and small business productivity systems, designing their hardware and TED video chip to match, with the 64 remaining as their general purpose gaming and home computer. Tramiel strongly believed, as Michael Tomczyk wrote in The Home Computer Wars, that "home computers would have the power of small business computers like IBM and Apple — but would be priced like home computers, perhaps as low as under $500." Smaller versions of the 264, with their much lower part counts, could even compete in the ultra-low market segment against systems like the ZX series in the UK. As Hartmann, Tomczyk and others in the software group felt the 264 would be most meaningful with built-in software, Magic Desk II became one of several possible option ROMs representing potential machine configurations, along with others featuring different programming languages or applications like a spreadsheet or terminal program. Tramiel embraced the idea, seeing it as a car with different models "just like General Motors." At least three "flavours," aligning with the internal groups in the software division (business, home and education), were envisioned — though the concept also met swift resistance from dealers and even Commodore's own sales team who protested having to handle multiple different versions of one computer. (One possible unspoken reason is that it was already known not to be 64 compatible, and dealers were undoubtedly unhappy about taking stock space away from a financial anchor.) With time yet again a factor, for the top-end "business flavour" the software division looked for a quick potential port and found it in Trilogy, a forthcoming 64 software package from Orange County, California-based Tri Micro demonstrated at Spring Comdex 1983. Trilogy was to be a combination of three existing Tri Micro programs, Your Home Office (word processor and spreadsheet) and The Write File (word processor and database) merged into a single application, and Plus Graph (charting) — what would have been called "integrated software" in those days. Commodore contracted with David Johnson, its developer and Tri Micro's VP of software engineering, to also port it to the 264. In January 1984 Jack Tramiel was forced out of the company he founded by chairman Irving Gould and shortly thereafter the 264 line was slashed by new CEO Marshall Smith. Three models were chosen from the various prototypes and experiments, the 16K 16 (and in Europe the 116 as well) to serve as the low-end, and the 64K 264, now renamed the Plus/4, as the high-end. Both the completed Magic Desk and Magic Desk II were cut, as was the education flavour based on a built-in Logo implementation. Only the Plus/4 would offer Trilogy, renamed to 3-Plus-1, and its ROM size was cut to 32K to reduce production costs further which in turn forced Johnson to make serious reductions in functionality. As a result 3-Plus-1 became nearly as maligned as the Plus/4 itself (mocked in the press as the "Minus/60" for its idiosyncrasies, deliberately incompatible ports and lack of 64 software compatibility), though yours truly actually used the spreadsheet for a household budget when I was a starving student, and it wasn't that bad. Nevertheless, as evidence of the hasty last-minute switch, the Plus/4 manual still makes vague reference to "built-in software packages," saying the computer will tell you "which packages are available and which function key to use to activate them." There was only ever one in the production model, and it was 3+1. As Tri-Micro had still maintained the rights, Trilogy was subsequently released in its original form for the 64 as Team-Mate to the rave reviews 3-Plus-1 never got (in July 1985 RUN called it "a high-performance program that Commodore users will discover to be one of the best available"). Johnson later got his chance to show what 3+1 was really capable of with Plus/Extra, a full disk version sold by Tri Micro, but it lacked the close integration of both Team-Mate and 3+1 and ended up tainted in the market by its predecessor. Commodore never adopted it. The failure of the Plus/4 to succeed the 64, much less overtake it, demonstrated clearly to Commodore management that 64 compatibility was essential in their next computer. Around this same time Sig Hartmann had noted the success of Atari's own first-party software unit Atarisoft on non-Atari platforms (though AtariLab was developed externally), even for the 64, and said there were similar plans to port Commodore first-party software and licenses to the Apple II, IBM PC and PCjr. (NARRATOR: This didn't happen.) However, by mid-1984 the software division had also developed a reputation for poor quality, with Scott Mace commenting in InfoWorld that — hits like International Soccer notwithstanding — "so far, the normal standard for Commodore software is mediocrity." In the meantime, Tramiel had bought the ailing Atari from Warner Communications and lured several Commodore managers, including Hartmann (who was already in conflict with Smith over cuts to the software division), to defect. Paul Goheen, the former systems software group head, became the new software chief. As the Commodore 128 neared completion, management constructed a new sales strategy to put it head to head against the Apple IIc and PCjr in specialty stores as well as Tramiel's favoured mass market retailers. To more plausibly bill it as a productivity machine, once again the software division had to look outside the company. Arktronics started in the dorms of the University of Michigan as a partnership between sophomore Robert "Bobby" Kotick and junior Howard Marks, who were then roommates. "We knew that unlike other industries," said Kotick in a 1984 interview, "there was a place for 19 and 20 year olds [in computers]." In July 1983 the company was formed to capitalize on Marks' ideas to envision a friendlier user interface for productivity applications. Marks, who was French, had previously worked for Apple and had access to its peripherals, including the then-novel use of a mouse as a pointer device. "This was way before there was ever a Lisa," Kotick added. "We realized that the biggest problem was that people like us couldn't use these things [computers] yet because they were too difficult and time-consuming to learn." They crafted a wish list and design document oriented to systems with 64K of RAM or less but featuring a picture (now we'd say icon-based) interface driven by a pointing device, such as a joystick or mouse, and an extensive on-line tutorial. Marks and Kotick hired students and even lured away some professors to work on the application, christened Jane after the Dick and Jane introductory reading books, who accepted shares in the company in lieu of salary. To fund development by their team of about thirty, Kotick tagged along with a friend to the annual Cattle Baron's Ball in Dallas at which he met real estate and casino investor Steve Wynn. Kotick managed to hitch a ride back to the East Coast on Wynn's plane where he pitched him on their company and Wynn encouraged him to write up a business plan. Three months later Marks and Kotick were summoned to Wynn's offices in Manhattan and flown to Atlantic City, whereupon Wynn handed them a cheque for $300,000 (in 2025 approximately $970,000) in exchange for a third of the company, providing business advice as the product progressed. Jane missed a first deadline for Comdex in December 1983 due to testing delays and finally launched at Softcon in February 1984 for the Apple II/II+ with 64K and the IIe at an MSRP of $295 [$920], later reduced to $179 [$560]. The program shipped on three colour-coded floppies, a grey bootable "systems disk" containing the word processor, database and spreadsheet applications (Janewrite, Janelist and Janecalc, respectively), a yellow "help disk" with the tutorial, and a black "data disk" for the user to save files. To ease the need for disk swapping, it would hunt for the right disk in either disk drive if you had two. Versions for the IBM PC and Atari 8-bits were said to be in progress. The initial release was uniquely accompanied by its own single-button mouse (Instagram link), a lower-cost unit — Kotick admitted settling for "a lesser quality product" — manufactured under contract by joystick maker Wico and incompatible with Apple's own later mouse options. This mouse interfaced to the Apple with a custom card and an 8-pin connector. Jane's appearance at the show attracted attention from another Steve, but at the Apple booth instead: Steve Jobs. Jobs visited the company in Ann Arbor and, suitably impressed, told Kotick and Marks they were wasting their time in college. Kotick duly dropped out to concentrate on the company, much to the consternation of his parents. Because it was intended to run on any existing Apple II with sufficient RAM, pretty much nothing was assumed about the hardware. It displayed strictly in monochrome and used the Apple hi-res mode to display upper and lowercase since the II/II+'s text mode was purely uppercase. Additionally, as 80-column capability wasn't universal, it used a software text shaper to display 60-column text in the word processor and, here, in the file requester. Basic windows like these, with title and information in the actual window bars, served for dialogue boxes and file selection. Although no emulator presently supports Jane's oddball original mouse, the PBS MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour did a piece on Arktronics in 1984 (the photo above of Marks and an open Apple II case is from this clip) and, along with pictures of the Arktronics offices which I've scattered throughout this article, had some screenshots that illustrate its capabilities. Here a document is being edited in Janewrite. You can see close, scroll and size gadgets in the window frame, but interestingly the control to maximize the current window is in the lower right. The top of the screen shows the editing tools (hand pointer, arrow, scissors [cut], camera [copy] and paste jar), icons for the three core apps, and then system-wide icons for on-line help, printing, the file manager, preferences and "STOP" to globally cancel an operation. Across the bottom, beside the window maximize gadget, are tools for adjusting line justification, font style (bold, underline, bold and underline, superscript, subscript), print settings and search. I'll have more to say about all of these when we get to Jane's Commodore port. Document windows could also be moved and resized, and multiple windows from different Jane applications could be open simultaneously. If you hit Control-Reset, a Easter egg briefly flashes on-screen with the names of the Apple II programmers: Mike Lagae, John R. Haggis, Brent Iverson, Jim Poje, Peter Lee, Uwe Pleban, Allen Leibowitz and Ken Roe. Because portability to other, sometimes wildly different, systems was always contemplated, application-level components were written in a high level language and compiled for the target (allegedly an early microcomputer dialect of C), with the graphics and I/O drivers written directly in assembly. With the release of the IIc Arktronics updated the program to support Apple's mouse as well. Reviews of the Apple II version were decidedly mixed. In June 1984, InfoWorld called it "innovative" but also observed that "overbearing use of icons, some slow features, and some awkwardness mar the product, which could benefit from an emphasis on efficiency rather than gimmickry." Down under, Your Computer in November 1984 liked the simple interface and believed it would appeal to undemanding users but criticized the 236-page manual and found the mouse unreliable. "When the mouse works properly, it is good," wrote reviewer Evan McHugh, but "when it doesn't it's the pits." Likewise, although A+'s 1985 review also liked the interface and the fact that multiple windows from each module could be open at once, the magazine also felt that "the individual modules in Jane are not up to professional productivity quality." Perhaps because of the software display, Janewrite "was too slow to respond to the keystrokes of a moderately proficient typist," and Janecalc, equally slow, was also panned as "crippled" because it only supported a 24x20 maximum spreadsheet. "Thank you, Jane," quipped reviewer Danny Goodman, "[l]eave your number at the door." Jane was also billed as available for the Commodore 64, even in contemporary advertising, but COMPUTE!'s Gazette in January 1985 said it was "scheduled to be released for the Commodore 64 by the time you read this. The price is expected to be about $80 [$240]." Interviewed for the article, Marks said that Jane for the 64 was to come as a combination cartridge and disk package, where a "32K plug-in cartridge" would quickly and automatically bring up the system. The article claimed the cartridge would autoboot the applications from (now) just a single floppy plus the data disk, though I suspect the actual configuration was that the cartridge contained the applications and the disk contained the online tutorial, simultaneously furnishing a modicum of both instant access and copy protection. Notably, this version didn't come with its own mouse; Marks said they were working to support third-party mice as well as joystick and "touch pad" (presumably KoalaPad) options instead. Accounting for publishing delays, the Gazette piece would have been written several months prior in the fall of 1984 — after advertisements for the C64 version of Jane had been in multiple periodicals such as Creative Computing and Family Computing claiming you could purchase it already. In fact, the 64 version of Jane would never be released — it was simply cancelled once Commodore paid Arktronics to port it to the 128 and badged it as a Commodore product. As the 128's graphic and sound capabilities are virtually identical to the 64's in 40-column mode, save for the extra colour RAM, the port was relatively straightforward. (At the same time Commodore also rebadged the CP/M-based Perfect Software series from Thorn EMI for the 128, but this was non-exclusive, and their rebranded versions were exactly the same as sold for other CP/M-compatible systems. Goheen promised "comprehensive and professional developer support" for the new computer.) The new Jane could also be made cheaper: since the 128 is capable of autobooting a suitably coded floppy disk in drive 8, the cartridge could be dispensed with and the less expensive three-floppy scheme restored (though the grey disk was now called the "application disk"). A 128-mode 1541 fastloader is used if the new and much faster 1570 or 1571 disk drives aren't detected, though the 1571 still boots Jane noticeably faster than the fastloader. (Parenthetically, a frequent misconception is that the Z80 in the 128 does the boot sector check to start CP/M. In fact, the 8502 does that after the Z80 has already checked the Commodore key isn't down and entered 128 mode. In CP/M's case, the code in the CP/M disk boot sector instructs the 8502 to give control back to the Z80 so it can finish the boot sequence — if this weren't the case, the BASIC BOOT command wouldn't be able to start CP/M. Interestingly, 1581s booting CP/M have a special startup file to keep their own CP/M boot sector in a different location.) Otherwise, Jane 128 openly betrayed its origins on the 64: other than fastbooting with the 1571, which it mostly got for free, and support for the 128's new keys it took no advantage of any other 128 features, in particular no 2MHz support nor true VDC 80-column mode. Although the manual and box copy say using a mouse is supported, only the original 1350 mouse works, which strictly emulates a joystick. All three applications that were in the Apple II version are included. Under the hood the apps are implemented as overlays for a central kernel called JANEGM. Sadly, I didn't see any obvious credits while scanning through the disk files. The manual, which appears to have been written by a third party, insists on camelcasing the apps as JaneWrite, JaneCalc and JaneList even though the rear box copy doesn't distinguish them that way and the Apple II version and Arktronics' own advertising called them Janewrite, Janecalc and Janelist. I'll use the latter here. Commodore also included some official marketing material with the box, hawking their new 1902 monitor (with 80 column mode, which was useless for Jane), 1571 disk drive (which works well with Jane), 1670 Modem/1200 (which Jane doesn't use), 512K REU (which Jane doesn't use either) and the 1350 mouse — which in this photo is somewhat different-appearing than the released 1350/1351, and might have been a mockup. Actually, this system would have been a very nice 128 setup and very similar to the one we'll be using both for real and in VICE. Too bad Jane 128 could use relatively little of it. Both Jane and the Perfect series were demonstrated with the 128 for Winter CES 1985, though Commodore didn't announce MSRPs then for any of them at the time. It eventually emerged later that year for $49.95 [$150]; by the next year some retailers were selling it for as low as $35 [$100], compared to each of the Perfect titles then going for $45 apiece [$130]. Plus, the Perfect titles, being CP/M-based, were bland and text-based and failed to show off the C128's graphics, so Commodore ended up emphasizing Jane more in its contemporary marketing. Booting Jane 128 from the 128DCR's internal 1571 drive with my own 1902 monitor. Although its interface is similar to the Apple II's in broad strokes, Jane 128's most obvious difference is colour. However, there are numerous more subtle UI changes in this version, sufficient for it to be called "Jane 2.0" internally before release. We'll step through them here and in the next set of screenshots because they're an interesting comparison point to modern human interface practice. As with the Apple II, across the top of the screen are the various icons, or what the manual calls "pictures." These were slightly altered for the 128 from the Apple II originals. The blue icons again set the mode of the pointer ("tools") from the hand pointer, the insertion arrow, scissors (cut), camera (copy) and paste jar. The current tool is highlighted. You select a new tool by clicking on it, but you can also use the function keys (CLR/HOME, F1, F3, F5 and F7). By modern conventions Jane's tools are used backwards: instead of selecting a text range and "choosing a tool" (e.g., Command-C for copy) to operate on it, you choose a tool first and with that tool select the text range it operates on. I'll demonstrate this specific functionality in a couple instances, but any verb-object operation in Jane will work this way. (Linguistically, this makes Jane a head-initial language, while most modern GUIs are head-final.) Next to the tools are the main apps, Janewrite (now in purple), Janecalc (in green) and Janelist (in cyan), and next to them in grey are the same standard applets built into the kernel (online help, print dialogue, disk/file manager and setup). Finally, the STOP icon, now a solid red, stops the current app, and can be used to escape some screens, though not all. Unexpectedly it doesn't serve to quit Jane entirely: you just turn the computer off. Jane remembers what app is loaded and doesn't reload the overlay if you exit and re-enter it. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel and thus matching the grey system disk. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record. Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. Despite the cool press reception, Magic Desk sold surprisingly well to new 64 users, and in numbers sufficient to solve its production problems such that its price dropped in half by late 1984. Sales were enough to propose an upgraded version called Magic Desk II for Commodore's new (and, ultimately to its detriment, incompatible) 264 series, capable of speech prompts when paired with the speech group's Magic Voice synthesizer hardware, and featuring a more sophisticated interface with "Lisa-like" pulldown menus and icons. At the same time the software division finished the remaining pieces of the original 64 Magic Desk (now simply called "The Magic Desk"), also with speech capability; the screenshots here of the presumably completed budget and phone modules are from prototype ROMs in an auction lot of Feagans' old Commodore memorabilia, double the size of the original version. Commodore intended the upper-tier 264s to be home and small business productivity systems, designing their hardware and TED video chip to match, with the 64 remaining as their general purpose gaming and home computer. Tramiel strongly believed, as Michael Tomczyk wrote in The Home Computer Wars, that "home computers would have the power of small business computers like IBM and Apple — but would be priced like home computers, perhaps as low as under $500." Smaller versions of the 264, with their much lower part counts, could even compete in the ultra-low market segment against systems like the ZX series in the UK. As Hartmann, Tomczyk and others in the software group felt the 264 would be most meaningful with built-in software, Magic Desk II became one of several possible option ROMs representing potential machine configurations, along with others featuring different programming languages or applications like a spreadsheet or terminal program. Tramiel embraced the idea, seeing it as a car with different models "just like General Motors." At least three "flavours," aligning with the internal groups in the software division (business, home and education), were envisioned — though the concept also met swift resistance from dealers and even Commodore's own sales team who protested having to handle multiple different versions of one computer. (One possible unspoken reason is that it was already known not to be 64 compatible, and dealers were undoubtedly unhappy about taking stock space away from a financial anchor.) With time yet again a factor, for the top-end "business flavour" the software division looked for a quick potential port and found it in Trilogy, a forthcoming 64 software package from Orange County, California-based Tri Micro demonstrated at Spring Comdex 1983. Trilogy was to be a combination of three existing Tri Micro programs, Your Home Office (word processor and spreadsheet) and The Write File (word processor and database) merged into a single application, and Plus Graph (charting) — what would have been called "integrated software" in those days. Commodore contracted with David Johnson, its developer and Tri Micro's VP of software engineering, to also port it to the 264. In January 1984 Jack Tramiel was forced out of the company he founded by chairman Irving Gould and shortly thereafter the 264 line was slashed by new CEO Marshall Smith. Three models were chosen from the various prototypes and experiments, the 16K 16 (and in Europe the 116 as well) to serve as the low-end, and the 64K 264, now renamed the Plus/4, as the high-end. Both the completed Magic Desk and Magic Desk II were cut, as was the education flavour based on a built-in Logo implementation. Only the Plus/4 would offer Trilogy, renamed to 3-Plus-1, and its ROM size was cut to 32K to reduce production costs further which in turn forced Johnson to make serious reductions in functionality. As a result 3-Plus-1 became nearly as maligned as the Plus/4 itself (mocked in the press as the "Minus/60" for its idiosyncrasies, deliberately incompatible ports and lack of 64 software compatibility), though yours truly actually used the spreadsheet for a household budget when I was a starving student, and it wasn't that bad. Nevertheless, as evidence of the hasty last-minute switch, the Plus/4 manual still makes vague reference to "built-in software packages," saying the computer will tell you "which packages are available and which function key to use to activate them." There was only ever one in the production model, and it was 3+1. As Tri-Micro had still maintained the rights, Trilogy was subsequently released in its original form for the 64 as Team-Mate to the rave reviews 3-Plus-1 never got (in July 1985 RUN called it "a high-performance program that Commodore users will discover to be one of the best available"). Johnson later got his chance to show what 3+1 was really capable of with Plus/Extra, a full disk version sold by Tri Micro, but it lacked the close integration of both Team-Mate and 3+1 and ended up tainted in the market by its predecessor. Commodore never adopted it. The failure of the Plus/4 to succeed the 64, much less overtake it, demonstrated clearly to Commodore management that 64 compatibility was essential in their next computer. Around this same time Sig Hartmann had noted the success of Atari's own first-party software unit Atarisoft on non-Atari platforms (though AtariLab was developed externally), even for the 64, and said there were similar plans to port Commodore first-party software and licenses to the Apple II, IBM PC and PCjr. (NARRATOR: This didn't happen.) However, by mid-1984 the software division had also developed a reputation for poor quality, with Scott Mace commenting in InfoWorld that — hits like International Soccer notwithstanding — "so far, the normal standard for Commodore software is mediocrity." In the meantime, Tramiel had bought the ailing Atari from Warner Communications and lured several Commodore managers, including Hartmann (who was already in conflict with Smith over cuts to the software division), to defect. Paul Goheen, the former systems software group head, became the new software chief. As the Commodore 128 neared completion, management constructed a new sales strategy to put it head to head against the Apple IIc and PCjr in specialty stores as well as Tramiel's favoured mass market retailers. To more plausibly bill it as a productivity machine, once again the software division had to look outside the company. Arktronics started in the dorms of the University of Michigan as a partnership between sophomore Robert "Bobby" Kotick and junior Howard Marks, who were then roommates. "We knew that unlike other industries," said Kotick in a 1984 interview, "there was a place for 19 and 20 year olds [in computers]." In July 1983 the company was formed to capitalize on Marks' ideas to envision a friendlier user interface for productivity applications. Marks, who was French, had previously worked for Apple and had access to its peripherals, including the then-novel use of a mouse as a pointer device. "This was way before there was ever a Lisa," Kotick added. "We realized that the biggest problem was that people like us couldn't use these things [computers] yet because they were too difficult and time-consuming to learn." They crafted a wish list and design document oriented to systems with 64K of RAM or less but featuring a picture (now we'd say icon-based) interface driven by a pointing device, such as a joystick or mouse, and an extensive on-line tutorial. Marks and Kotick hired students and even lured away some professors to work on the application, christened Jane after the Dick and Jane introductory reading books, who accepted shares in the company in lieu of salary. To fund development by their team of about thirty, Kotick tagged along with a friend to the annual Cattle Baron's Ball in Dallas at which he met real estate and casino investor Steve Wynn. Kotick managed to hitch a ride back to the East Coast on Wynn's plane where he pitched him on their company and Wynn encouraged him to write up a business plan. Three months later Marks and Kotick were summoned to Wynn's offices in Manhattan and flown to Atlantic City, whereupon Wynn handed them a cheque for $300,000 (in 2025 approximately $970,000) in exchange for a third of the company, providing business advice as the product progressed. Jane missed a first deadline for Comdex in December 1983 due to testing delays and finally launched at Softcon in February 1984 for the Apple II/II+ with 64K and the IIe at an MSRP of $295 [$920], later reduced to $179 [$560]. The program shipped on three colour-coded floppies, a grey bootable "systems disk" containing the word processor, database and spreadsheet applications (Janewrite, Janelist and Janecalc, respectively), a yellow "help disk" with the tutorial, and a black "data disk" for the user to save files. To ease the need for disk swapping, it would hunt for the right disk in either disk drive if you had two. Versions for the IBM PC and Atari 8-bits were said to be in progress. The initial release was uniquely accompanied by its own single-button mouse (Instagram link), a lower-cost unit — Kotick admitted settling for "a lesser quality product" — manufactured under contract by joystick maker Wico and incompatible with Apple's own later mouse options. This mouse interfaced to the Apple with a custom card and an 8-pin connector. Jane's appearance at the show attracted attention from another Steve, but at the Apple booth instead: Steve Jobs. Jobs visited the company in Ann Arbor and, suitably impressed, told Kotick and Marks they were wasting their time in college. Kotick duly dropped out to concentrate on the company, much to the consternation of his parents. Because it was intended to run on any existing Apple II with sufficient RAM, pretty much nothing was assumed about the hardware. It displayed strictly in monochrome and used the Apple hi-res mode to display upper and lowercase since the II/II+'s text mode was purely uppercase. Additionally, as 80-column capability wasn't universal, it used a software text shaper to display 60-column text in the word processor and, here, in the file requester. Basic windows like these, with title and information in the actual window bars, served for dialogue boxes and file selection. Although no emulator presently supports Jane's oddball original mouse, the PBS MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour did a piece on Arktronics in 1984 (the photo above of Marks and an open Apple II case is from this clip) and, along with pictures of the Arktronics offices which I've scattered throughout this article, had some screenshots that illustrate its capabilities. Here a document is being edited in Janewrite. You can see close, scroll and size gadgets in the window frame, but interestingly the control to maximize the current window is in the lower right. The top of the screen shows the editing tools (hand pointer, arrow, scissors [cut], camera [copy] and paste jar), icons for the three core apps, and then system-wide icons for on-line help, printing, the file manager, preferences and "STOP" to globally cancel an operation. Across the bottom, beside the window maximize gadget, are tools for adjusting line justification, font style (bold, underline, bold and underline, superscript, subscript), print settings and search. I'll have more to say about all of these when we get to Jane's Commodore port. Document windows could also be moved and resized, and multiple windows from different Jane applications could be open simultaneously. If you hit Control-Reset, a Easter egg briefly flashes on-screen with the names of the Apple II programmers: Mike Lagae, John R. Haggis, Brent Iverson, Jim Poje, Peter Lee, Uwe Pleban, Allen Leibowitz and Ken Roe. Because portability to other, sometimes wildly different, systems was always contemplated, application-level components were written in a high level language and compiled for the target (allegedly an early microcomputer dialect of C), with the graphics and I/O drivers written directly in assembly. With the release of the IIc Arktronics updated the program to support Apple's mouse as well. Reviews of the Apple II version were decidedly mixed. In June 1984, InfoWorld called it "innovative" but also observed that "overbearing use of icons, some slow features, and some awkwardness mar the product, which could benefit from an emphasis on efficiency rather than gimmickry." Down under, Your Computer in November 1984 liked the simple interface and believed it would appeal to undemanding users but criticized the 236-page manual and found the mouse unreliable. "When the mouse works properly, it is good," wrote reviewer Evan McHugh, but "when it doesn't it's the pits." Likewise, although A+'s 1985 review also liked the interface and the fact that multiple windows from each module could be open at once, the magazine also felt that "the individual modules in Jane are not up to professional productivity quality." Perhaps because of the software display, Janewrite "was too slow to respond to the keystrokes of a moderately proficient typist," and Janecalc, equally slow, was also panned as "crippled" because it only supported a 24x20 maximum spreadsheet. "Thank you, Jane," quipped reviewer Danny Goodman, "[l]eave your number at the door." Jane was also billed as available for the Commodore 64, even in contemporary advertising, but COMPUTE!'s Gazette in January 1985 said it was "scheduled to be released for the Commodore 64 by the time you read this. The price is expected to be about $80 [$240]." Interviewed for the article, Marks said that Jane for the 64 was to come as a combination cartridge and disk package, where a "32K plug-in cartridge" would quickly and automatically bring up the system. The article claimed the cartridge would autoboot the applications from (now) just a single floppy plus the data disk, though I suspect the actual configuration was that the cartridge contained the applications and the disk contained the online tutorial, simultaneously furnishing a modicum of both instant access and copy protection. Notably, this version didn't come with its own mouse; Marks said they were working to support third-party mice as well as joystick and "touch pad" (presumably KoalaPad) options instead. Accounting for publishing delays, the Gazette piece would have been written several months prior in the fall of 1984 — after advertisements for the C64 version of Jane had been in multiple periodicals such as Creative Computing and Family Computing claiming you could purchase it already. In fact, the 64 version of Jane would never be released — it was simply cancelled once Commodore paid Arktronics to port it to the 128 and badged it as a Commodore product. As the 128's graphic and sound capabilities are virtually identical to the 64's in 40-column mode, save for the extra colour RAM, the port was relatively straightforward. (At the same time Commodore also rebadged the CP/M-based Perfect Software series from Thorn EMI for the 128, but this was non-exclusive, and their rebranded versions were exactly the same as sold for other CP/M-compatible systems. Goheen promised "comprehensive and professional developer support" for the new computer.) The new Jane could also be made cheaper: since the 128 is capable of autobooting a suitably coded floppy disk in drive 8, the cartridge could be dispensed with and the less expensive three-floppy scheme restored (though the grey disk was now called the "application disk"). A 128-mode 1541 fastloader is used if the new and much faster 1570 or 1571 disk drives aren't detected, though the 1571 still boots Jane noticeably faster than the fastloader. (Parenthetically, a frequent misconception is that the Z80 in the 128 does the boot sector check to start CP/M. In fact, the 8502 does that after the Z80 has already checked the Commodore key isn't down and entered 128 mode. In CP/M's case, the code in the CP/M disk boot sector instructs the 8502 to give control back to the Z80 so it can finish the boot sequence — if this weren't the case, the BASIC BOOT command wouldn't be able to start CP/M. Interestingly, 1581s booting CP/M have a special startup file to keep their own CP/M boot sector in a different location.) Otherwise, Jane 128 openly betrayed its origins on the 64: other than fastbooting with the 1571, which it mostly got for free, and support for the 128's new keys it took no advantage of any other 128 features, in particular no 2MHz support nor true VDC 80-column mode. Although the manual and box copy say using a mouse is supported, only the original 1350 mouse works, which strictly emulates a joystick. All three applications that were in the Apple II version are included. Under the hood the apps are implemented as overlays for a central kernel called JANEGM. Sadly, I didn't see any obvious credits while scanning through the disk files. The manual, which appears to have been written by a third party, insists on camelcasing the apps as JaneWrite, JaneCalc and JaneList even though the rear box copy doesn't distinguish them that way and the Apple II version and Arktronics' own advertising called them Janewrite, Janecalc and Janelist. I'll use the latter here. Commodore also included some official marketing material with the box, hawking their new 1902 monitor (with 80 column mode, which was useless for Jane), 1571 disk drive (which works well with Jane), 1670 Modem/1200 (which Jane doesn't use), 512K REU (which Jane doesn't use either) and the 1350 mouse — which in this photo is somewhat different-appearing than the released 1350/1351, and might have been a mockup. Actually, this system would have been a very nice 128 setup and very similar to the one we'll be using both for real and in VICE. Too bad Jane 128 could use relatively little of it. Both Jane and the Perfect series were demonstrated with the 128 for Winter CES 1985, though Commodore didn't announce MSRPs then for any of them at the time. It eventually emerged later that year for $49.95 [$150]; by the next year some retailers were selling it for as low as $35 [$100], compared to each of the Perfect titles then going for $45 apiece [$130]. Plus, the Perfect titles, being CP/M-based, were bland and text-based and failed to show off the C128's graphics, so Commodore ended up emphasizing Jane more in its contemporary marketing. Booting Jane 128 from the 128DCR's internal 1571 drive with my own 1902 monitor. Although its interface is similar to the Apple II's in broad strokes, Jane 128's most obvious difference is colour. However, there are numerous more subtle UI changes in this version, sufficient for it to be called "Jane 2.0" internally before release. We'll step through them here and in the next set of screenshots because they're an interesting comparison point to modern human interface practice. As with the Apple II, across the top of the screen are the various icons, or what the manual calls "pictures." These were slightly altered for the 128 from the Apple II originals. The blue icons again set the mode of the pointer ("tools") from the hand pointer, the insertion arrow, scissors (cut), camera (copy) and paste jar. The current tool is highlighted. You select a new tool by clicking on it, but you can also use the function keys (CLR/HOME, F1, F3, F5 and F7). By modern conventions Jane's tools are used backwards: instead of selecting a text range and "choosing a tool" (e.g., Command-C for copy) to operate on it, you choose a tool first and with that tool select the text range it operates on. I'll demonstrate this specific functionality in a couple instances, but any verb-object operation in Jane will work this way. (Linguistically, this makes Jane a head-initial language, while most modern GUIs are head-final.) Next to the tools are the main apps, Janewrite (now in purple), Janecalc (in green) and Janelist (in cyan), and next to them in grey are the same standard applets built into the kernel (online help, print dialogue, disk/file manager and setup). Finally, the STOP icon, now a solid red, stops the current app, and can be used to escape some screens, though not all. Unexpectedly it doesn't serve to quit Jane entirely: you just turn the computer off. Jane remembers what app is loaded and doesn't reload the overlay if you exit and re-enter it. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel and thus matching the grey system disk. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. As Hartmann, Tomczyk and others in the software group felt the 264 would be most meaningful with built-in software, Magic Desk II became one of several possible option ROMs representing potential machine configurations, along with others featuring different programming languages or applications like a spreadsheet or terminal program. Tramiel embraced the idea, seeing it as a car with different models "just like General Motors." At least three "flavours," aligning with the internal groups in the software division (business, home and education), were envisioned — though the concept also met swift resistance from dealers and even Commodore's own sales team who protested having to handle multiple different versions of one computer. (One possible unspoken reason is that it was already known not to be 64 compatible, and dealers were undoubtedly unhappy about taking stock space away from a financial anchor.) With time yet again a factor, for the top-end "business flavour" the software division looked for a quick potential port and found it in Trilogy, a forthcoming 64 software package from Orange County, California-based Tri Micro demonstrated at Spring Comdex 1983. Trilogy was to be a combination of three existing Tri Micro programs, Your Home Office (word processor and spreadsheet) and The Write File (word processor and database) merged into a single application, and Plus Graph (charting) — what would have been called "integrated software" in those days. Commodore contracted with David Johnson, its developer and Tri Micro's VP of software engineering, to also port it to the 264. In January 1984 Jack Tramiel was forced out of the company he founded by chairman Irving Gould and shortly thereafter the 264 line was slashed by new CEO Marshall Smith. Three models were chosen from the various prototypes and experiments, the 16K 16 (and in Europe the 116 as well) to serve as the low-end, and the 64K 264, now renamed the Plus/4, as the high-end. Both the completed Magic Desk and Magic Desk II were cut, as was the education flavour based on a built-in Logo implementation. Only the Plus/4 would offer Trilogy, renamed to 3-Plus-1, and its ROM size was cut to 32K to reduce production costs further which in turn forced Johnson to make serious reductions in functionality. As a result 3-Plus-1 became nearly as maligned as the Plus/4 itself (mocked in the press as the "Minus/60" for its idiosyncrasies, deliberately incompatible ports and lack of 64 software compatibility), though yours truly actually used the spreadsheet for a household budget when I was a starving student, and it wasn't that bad. Nevertheless, as evidence of the hasty last-minute switch, the Plus/4 manual still makes vague reference to "built-in software packages," saying the computer will tell you "which packages are available and which function key to use to activate them." There was only ever one in the production model, and it was 3+1. As Tri-Micro had still maintained the rights, Trilogy was subsequently released in its original form for the 64 as Team-Mate to the rave reviews 3-Plus-1 never got (in July 1985 RUN called it "a high-performance program that Commodore users will discover to be one of the best available"). Johnson later got his chance to show what 3+1 was really capable of with Plus/Extra, a full disk version sold by Tri Micro, but it lacked the close integration of both Team-Mate and 3+1 and ended up tainted in the market by its predecessor. Commodore never adopted it. The failure of the Plus/4 to succeed the 64, much less overtake it, demonstrated clearly to Commodore management that 64 compatibility was essential in their next computer. Around this same time Sig Hartmann had noted the success of Atari's own first-party software unit Atarisoft on non-Atari platforms (though AtariLab was developed externally), even for the 64, and said there were similar plans to port Commodore first-party software and licenses to the Apple II, IBM PC and PCjr. (NARRATOR: This didn't happen.) However, by mid-1984 the software division had also developed a reputation for poor quality, with Scott Mace commenting in InfoWorld that — hits like International Soccer notwithstanding — "so far, the normal standard for Commodore software is mediocrity." In the meantime, Tramiel had bought the ailing Atari from Warner Communications and lured several Commodore managers, including Hartmann (who was already in conflict with Smith over cuts to the software division), to defect. Paul Goheen, the former systems software group head, became the new software chief. As the Commodore 128 neared completion, management constructed a new sales strategy to put it head to head against the Apple IIc and PCjr in specialty stores as well as Tramiel's favoured mass market retailers. To more plausibly bill it as a productivity machine, once again the software division had to look outside the company. Arktronics started in the dorms of the University of Michigan as a partnership between sophomore Robert "Bobby" Kotick and junior Howard Marks, who were then roommates. "We knew that unlike other industries," said Kotick in a 1984 interview, "there was a place for 19 and 20 year olds [in computers]." In July 1983 the company was formed to capitalize on Marks' ideas to envision a friendlier user interface for productivity applications. Marks, who was French, had previously worked for Apple and had access to its peripherals, including the then-novel use of a mouse as a pointer device. "This was way before there was ever a Lisa," Kotick added. "We realized that the biggest problem was that people like us couldn't use these things [computers] yet because they were too difficult and time-consuming to learn." They crafted a wish list and design document oriented to systems with 64K of RAM or less but featuring a picture (now we'd say icon-based) interface driven by a pointing device, such as a joystick or mouse, and an extensive on-line tutorial. Marks and Kotick hired students and even lured away some professors to work on the application, christened Jane after the Dick and Jane introductory reading books, who accepted shares in the company in lieu of salary. To fund development by their team of about thirty, Kotick tagged along with a friend to the annual Cattle Baron's Ball in Dallas at which he met real estate and casino investor Steve Wynn. Kotick managed to hitch a ride back to the East Coast on Wynn's plane where he pitched him on their company and Wynn encouraged him to write up a business plan. Three months later Marks and Kotick were summoned to Wynn's offices in Manhattan and flown to Atlantic City, whereupon Wynn handed them a cheque for $300,000 (in 2025 approximately $970,000) in exchange for a third of the company, providing business advice as the product progressed. Jane missed a first deadline for Comdex in December 1983 due to testing delays and finally launched at Softcon in February 1984 for the Apple II/II+ with 64K and the IIe at an MSRP of $295 [$920], later reduced to $179 [$560]. The program shipped on three colour-coded floppies, a grey bootable "systems disk" containing the word processor, database and spreadsheet applications (Janewrite, Janelist and Janecalc, respectively), a yellow "help disk" with the tutorial, and a black "data disk" for the user to save files. To ease the need for disk swapping, it would hunt for the right disk in either disk drive if you had two. Versions for the IBM PC and Atari 8-bits were said to be in progress. The initial release was uniquely accompanied by its own single-button mouse (Instagram link), a lower-cost unit — Kotick admitted settling for "a lesser quality product" — manufactured under contract by joystick maker Wico and incompatible with Apple's own later mouse options. This mouse interfaced to the Apple with a custom card and an 8-pin connector. Jane's appearance at the show attracted attention from another Steve, but at the Apple booth instead: Steve Jobs. Jobs visited the company in Ann Arbor and, suitably impressed, told Kotick and Marks they were wasting their time in college. Kotick duly dropped out to concentrate on the company, much to the consternation of his parents. Because it was intended to run on any existing Apple II with sufficient RAM, pretty much nothing was assumed about the hardware. It displayed strictly in monochrome and used the Apple hi-res mode to display upper and lowercase since the II/II+'s text mode was purely uppercase. Additionally, as 80-column capability wasn't universal, it used a software text shaper to display 60-column text in the word processor and, here, in the file requester. Basic windows like these, with title and information in the actual window bars, served for dialogue boxes and file selection. Although no emulator presently supports Jane's oddball original mouse, the PBS MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour did a piece on Arktronics in 1984 (the photo above of Marks and an open Apple II case is from this clip) and, along with pictures of the Arktronics offices which I've scattered throughout this article, had some screenshots that illustrate its capabilities. Here a document is being edited in Janewrite. You can see close, scroll and size gadgets in the window frame, but interestingly the control to maximize the current window is in the lower right. The top of the screen shows the editing tools (hand pointer, arrow, scissors [cut], camera [copy] and paste jar), icons for the three core apps, and then system-wide icons for on-line help, printing, the file manager, preferences and "STOP" to globally cancel an operation. Across the bottom, beside the window maximize gadget, are tools for adjusting line justification, font style (bold, underline, bold and underline, superscript, subscript), print settings and search. I'll have more to say about all of these when we get to Jane's Commodore port. Document windows could also be moved and resized, and multiple windows from different Jane applications could be open simultaneously. If you hit Control-Reset, a Easter egg briefly flashes on-screen with the names of the Apple II programmers: Mike Lagae, John R. Haggis, Brent Iverson, Jim Poje, Peter Lee, Uwe Pleban, Allen Leibowitz and Ken Roe. Because portability to other, sometimes wildly different, systems was always contemplated, application-level components were written in a high level language and compiled for the target (allegedly an early microcomputer dialect of C), with the graphics and I/O drivers written directly in assembly. With the release of the IIc Arktronics updated the program to support Apple's mouse as well. Reviews of the Apple II version were decidedly mixed. In June 1984, InfoWorld called it "innovative" but also observed that "overbearing use of icons, some slow features, and some awkwardness mar the product, which could benefit from an emphasis on efficiency rather than gimmickry." Down under, Your Computer in November 1984 liked the simple interface and believed it would appeal to undemanding users but criticized the 236-page manual and found the mouse unreliable. "When the mouse works properly, it is good," wrote reviewer Evan McHugh, but "when it doesn't it's the pits." Likewise, although A+'s 1985 review also liked the interface and the fact that multiple windows from each module could be open at once, the magazine also felt that "the individual modules in Jane are not up to professional productivity quality." Perhaps because of the software display, Janewrite "was too slow to respond to the keystrokes of a moderately proficient typist," and Janecalc, equally slow, was also panned as "crippled" because it only supported a 24x20 maximum spreadsheet. "Thank you, Jane," quipped reviewer Danny Goodman, "[l]eave your number at the door." Jane was also billed as available for the Commodore 64, even in contemporary advertising, but COMPUTE!'s Gazette in January 1985 said it was "scheduled to be released for the Commodore 64 by the time you read this. The price is expected to be about $80 [$240]." Interviewed for the article, Marks said that Jane for the 64 was to come as a combination cartridge and disk package, where a "32K plug-in cartridge" would quickly and automatically bring up the system. The article claimed the cartridge would autoboot the applications from (now) just a single floppy plus the data disk, though I suspect the actual configuration was that the cartridge contained the applications and the disk contained the online tutorial, simultaneously furnishing a modicum of both instant access and copy protection. Notably, this version didn't come with its own mouse; Marks said they were working to support third-party mice as well as joystick and "touch pad" (presumably KoalaPad) options instead. Accounting for publishing delays, the Gazette piece would have been written several months prior in the fall of 1984 — after advertisements for the C64 version of Jane had been in multiple periodicals such as Creative Computing and Family Computing claiming you could purchase it already. In fact, the 64 version of Jane would never be released — it was simply cancelled once Commodore paid Arktronics to port it to the 128 and badged it as a Commodore product. As the 128's graphic and sound capabilities are virtually identical to the 64's in 40-column mode, save for the extra colour RAM, the port was relatively straightforward. (At the same time Commodore also rebadged the CP/M-based Perfect Software series from Thorn EMI for the 128, but this was non-exclusive, and their rebranded versions were exactly the same as sold for other CP/M-compatible systems. Goheen promised "comprehensive and professional developer support" for the new computer.) The new Jane could also be made cheaper: since the 128 is capable of autobooting a suitably coded floppy disk in drive 8, the cartridge could be dispensed with and the less expensive three-floppy scheme restored (though the grey disk was now called the "application disk"). A 128-mode 1541 fastloader is used if the new and much faster 1570 or 1571 disk drives aren't detected, though the 1571 still boots Jane noticeably faster than the fastloader. (Parenthetically, a frequent misconception is that the Z80 in the 128 does the boot sector check to start CP/M. In fact, the 8502 does that after the Z80 has already checked the Commodore key isn't down and entered 128 mode. In CP/M's case, the code in the CP/M disk boot sector instructs the 8502 to give control back to the Z80 so it can finish the boot sequence — if this weren't the case, the BASIC BOOT command wouldn't be able to start CP/M. Interestingly, 1581s booting CP/M have a special startup file to keep their own CP/M boot sector in a different location.) Otherwise, Jane 128 openly betrayed its origins on the 64: other than fastbooting with the 1571, which it mostly got for free, and support for the 128's new keys it took no advantage of any other 128 features, in particular no 2MHz support nor true VDC 80-column mode. Although the manual and box copy say using a mouse is supported, only the original 1350 mouse works, which strictly emulates a joystick. All three applications that were in the Apple II version are included. Under the hood the apps are implemented as overlays for a central kernel called JANEGM. Sadly, I didn't see any obvious credits while scanning through the disk files. The manual, which appears to have been written by a third party, insists on camelcasing the apps as JaneWrite, JaneCalc and JaneList even though the rear box copy doesn't distinguish them that way and the Apple II version and Arktronics' own advertising called them Janewrite, Janecalc and Janelist. I'll use the latter here. Commodore also included some official marketing material with the box, hawking their new 1902 monitor (with 80 column mode, which was useless for Jane), 1571 disk drive (which works well with Jane), 1670 Modem/1200 (which Jane doesn't use), 512K REU (which Jane doesn't use either) and the 1350 mouse — which in this photo is somewhat different-appearing than the released 1350/1351, and might have been a mockup. Actually, this system would have been a very nice 128 setup and very similar to the one we'll be using both for real and in VICE. Too bad Jane 128 could use relatively little of it. Both Jane and the Perfect series were demonstrated with the 128 for Winter CES 1985, though Commodore didn't announce MSRPs then for any of them at the time. It eventually emerged later that year for $49.95 [$150]; by the next year some retailers were selling it for as low as $35 [$100], compared to each of the Perfect titles then going for $45 apiece [$130]. Plus, the Perfect titles, being CP/M-based, were bland and text-based and failed to show off the C128's graphics, so Commodore ended up emphasizing Jane more in its contemporary marketing. Booting Jane 128 from the 128DCR's internal 1571 drive with my own 1902 monitor. Although its interface is similar to the Apple II's in broad strokes, Jane 128's most obvious difference is colour. However, there are numerous more subtle UI changes in this version, sufficient for it to be called "Jane 2.0" internally before release. We'll step through them here and in the next set of screenshots because they're an interesting comparison point to modern human interface practice. As with the Apple II, across the top of the screen are the various icons, or what the manual calls "pictures." These were slightly altered for the 128 from the Apple II originals. The blue icons again set the mode of the pointer ("tools") from the hand pointer, the insertion arrow, scissors (cut), camera (copy) and paste jar. The current tool is highlighted. You select a new tool by clicking on it, but you can also use the function keys (CLR/HOME, F1, F3, F5 and F7). By modern conventions Jane's tools are used backwards: instead of selecting a text range and "choosing a tool" (e.g., Command-C for copy) to operate on it, you choose a tool first and with that tool select the text range it operates on. I'll demonstrate this specific functionality in a couple instances, but any verb-object operation in Jane will work this way. (Linguistically, this makes Jane a head-initial language, while most modern GUIs are head-final.) Next to the tools are the main apps, Janewrite (now in purple), Janecalc (in green) and Janelist (in cyan), and next to them in grey are the same standard applets built into the kernel (online help, print dialogue, disk/file manager and setup). Finally, the STOP icon, now a solid red, stops the current app, and can be used to escape some screens, though not all. Unexpectedly it doesn't serve to quit Jane entirely: you just turn the computer off. Jane remembers what app is loaded and doesn't reload the overlay if you exit and re-enter it. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel and thus matching the grey system disk. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record. Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

The left margin is (probably) at byte offset 6 because the right margin is at byte offset 8 (also a 16-bit LE short), followed by the paragraph indent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. In January 1984 Jack Tramiel was forced out of the company he founded by chairman Irving Gould and shortly thereafter the 264 line was slashed by new CEO Marshall Smith. Three models were chosen from the various prototypes and experiments, the 16K 16 (and in Europe the 116 as well) to serve as the low-end, and the 64K 264, now renamed the Plus/4, as the high-end. Both the completed Magic Desk and Magic Desk II were cut, as was the education flavour based on a built-in Logo implementation. Only the Plus/4 would offer Trilogy, renamed to 3-Plus-1, and its ROM size was cut to 32K to reduce production costs further which in turn forced Johnson to make serious reductions in functionality. As a result 3-Plus-1 became nearly as maligned as the Plus/4 itself (mocked in the press as the "Minus/60" for its idiosyncrasies, deliberately incompatible ports and lack of 64 software compatibility), though yours truly actually used the spreadsheet for a household budget when I was a starving student, and it wasn't that bad. Nevertheless, as evidence of the hasty last-minute switch, the Plus/4 manual still makes vague reference to "built-in software packages," saying the computer will tell you "which packages are available and which function key to use to activate them." There was only ever one in the production model, and it was 3+1. As Tri-Micro had still maintained the rights, Trilogy was subsequently released in its original form for the 64 as Team-Mate to the rave reviews 3-Plus-1 never got (in July 1985 RUN called it "a high-performance program that Commodore users will discover to be one of the best available"). Johnson later got his chance to show what 3+1 was really capable of with Plus/Extra, a full disk version sold by Tri Micro, but it lacked the close integration of both Team-Mate and 3+1 and ended up tainted in the market by its predecessor. Commodore never adopted it. The failure of the Plus/4 to succeed the 64, much less overtake it, demonstrated clearly to Commodore management that 64 compatibility was essential in their next computer. Around this same time Sig Hartmann had noted the success of Atari's own first-party software unit Atarisoft on non-Atari platforms (though AtariLab was developed externally), even for the 64, and said there were similar plans to port Commodore first-party software and licenses to the Apple II, IBM PC and PCjr. (NARRATOR: This didn't happen.) However, by mid-1984 the software division had also developed a reputation for poor quality, with Scott Mace commenting in InfoWorld that — hits like International Soccer notwithstanding — "so far, the normal standard for Commodore software is mediocrity." In the meantime, Tramiel had bought the ailing Atari from Warner Communications and lured several Commodore managers, including Hartmann (who was already in conflict with Smith over cuts to the software division), to defect. Paul Goheen, the former systems software group head, became the new software chief. As the Commodore 128 neared completion, management constructed a new sales strategy to put it head to head against the Apple IIc and PCjr in specialty stores as well as Tramiel's favoured mass market retailers. To more plausibly bill it as a productivity machine, once again the software division had to look outside the company. Arktronics started in the dorms of the University of Michigan as a partnership between sophomore Robert "Bobby" Kotick and junior Howard Marks, who were then roommates. "We knew that unlike other industries," said Kotick in a 1984 interview, "there was a place for 19 and 20 year olds [in computers]." In July 1983 the company was formed to capitalize on Marks' ideas to envision a friendlier user interface for productivity applications. Marks, who was French, had previously worked for Apple and had access to its peripherals, including the then-novel use of a mouse as a pointer device. "This was way before there was ever a Lisa," Kotick added. "We realized that the biggest problem was that people like us couldn't use these things [computers] yet because they were too difficult and time-consuming to learn." They crafted a wish list and design document oriented to systems with 64K of RAM or less but featuring a picture (now we'd say icon-based) interface driven by a pointing device, such as a joystick or mouse, and an extensive on-line tutorial. Marks and Kotick hired students and even lured away some professors to work on the application, christened Jane after the Dick and Jane introductory reading books, who accepted shares in the company in lieu of salary. To fund development by their team of about thirty, Kotick tagged along with a friend to the annual Cattle Baron's Ball in Dallas at which he met real estate and casino investor Steve Wynn. Kotick managed to hitch a ride back to the East Coast on Wynn's plane where he pitched him on their company and Wynn encouraged him to write up a business plan. Three months later Marks and Kotick were summoned to Wynn's offices in Manhattan and flown to Atlantic City, whereupon Wynn handed them a cheque for $300,000 (in 2025 approximately $970,000) in exchange for a third of the company, providing business advice as the product progressed. Jane missed a first deadline for Comdex in December 1983 due to testing delays and finally launched at Softcon in February 1984 for the Apple II/II+ with 64K and the IIe at an MSRP of $295 [$920], later reduced to $179 [$560]. The program shipped on three colour-coded floppies, a grey bootable "systems disk" containing the word processor, database and spreadsheet applications (Janewrite, Janelist and Janecalc, respectively), a yellow "help disk" with the tutorial, and a black "data disk" for the user to save files. To ease the need for disk swapping, it would hunt for the right disk in either disk drive if you had two. Versions for the IBM PC and Atari 8-bits were said to be in progress. The initial release was uniquely accompanied by its own single-button mouse (Instagram link), a lower-cost unit — Kotick admitted settling for "a lesser quality product" — manufactured under contract by joystick maker Wico and incompatible with Apple's own later mouse options. This mouse interfaced to the Apple with a custom card and an 8-pin connector. Jane's appearance at the show attracted attention from another Steve, but at the Apple booth instead: Steve Jobs. Jobs visited the company in Ann Arbor and, suitably impressed, told Kotick and Marks they were wasting their time in college. Kotick duly dropped out to concentrate on the company, much to the consternation of his parents. Because it was intended to run on any existing Apple II with sufficient RAM, pretty much nothing was assumed about the hardware. It displayed strictly in monochrome and used the Apple hi-res mode to display upper and lowercase since the II/II+'s text mode was purely uppercase. Additionally, as 80-column capability wasn't universal, it used a software text shaper to display 60-column text in the word processor and, here, in the file requester. Basic windows like these, with title and information in the actual window bars, served for dialogue boxes and file selection. Although no emulator presently supports Jane's oddball original mouse, the PBS MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour did a piece on Arktronics in 1984 (the photo above of Marks and an open Apple II case is from this clip) and, along with pictures of the Arktronics offices which I've scattered throughout this article, had some screenshots that illustrate its capabilities. Here a document is being edited in Janewrite. You can see close, scroll and size gadgets in the window frame, but interestingly the control to maximize the current window is in the lower right. The top of the screen shows the editing tools (hand pointer, arrow, scissors [cut], camera [copy] and paste jar), icons for the three core apps, and then system-wide icons for on-line help, printing, the file manager, preferences and "STOP" to globally cancel an operation. Across the bottom, beside the window maximize gadget, are tools for adjusting line justification, font style (bold, underline, bold and underline, superscript, subscript), print settings and search. I'll have more to say about all of these when we get to Jane's Commodore port. Document windows could also be moved and resized, and multiple windows from different Jane applications could be open simultaneously. If you hit Control-Reset, a Easter egg briefly flashes on-screen with the names of the Apple II programmers: Mike Lagae, John R. Haggis, Brent Iverson, Jim Poje, Peter Lee, Uwe Pleban, Allen Leibowitz and Ken Roe. Because portability to other, sometimes wildly different, systems was always contemplated, application-level components were written in a high level language and compiled for the target (allegedly an early microcomputer dialect of C), with the graphics and I/O drivers written directly in assembly. With the release of the IIc Arktronics updated the program to support Apple's mouse as well. Reviews of the Apple II version were decidedly mixed. In June 1984, InfoWorld called it "innovative" but also observed that "overbearing use of icons, some slow features, and some awkwardness mar the product, which could benefit from an emphasis on efficiency rather than gimmickry." Down under, Your Computer in November 1984 liked the simple interface and believed it would appeal to undemanding users but criticized the 236-page manual and found the mouse unreliable. "When the mouse works properly, it is good," wrote reviewer Evan McHugh, but "when it doesn't it's the pits." Likewise, although A+'s 1985 review also liked the interface and the fact that multiple windows from each module could be open at once, the magazine also felt that "the individual modules in Jane are not up to professional productivity quality." Perhaps because of the software display, Janewrite "was too slow to respond to the keystrokes of a moderately proficient typist," and Janecalc, equally slow, was also panned as "crippled" because it only supported a 24x20 maximum spreadsheet. "Thank you, Jane," quipped reviewer Danny Goodman, "[l]eave your number at the door." Jane was also billed as available for the Commodore 64, even in contemporary advertising, but COMPUTE!'s Gazette in January 1985 said it was "scheduled to be released for the Commodore 64 by the time you read this. The price is expected to be about $80 [$240]." Interviewed for the article, Marks said that Jane for the 64 was to come as a combination cartridge and disk package, where a "32K plug-in cartridge" would quickly and automatically bring up the system. The article claimed the cartridge would autoboot the applications from (now) just a single floppy plus the data disk, though I suspect the actual configuration was that the cartridge contained the applications and the disk contained the online tutorial, simultaneously furnishing a modicum of both instant access and copy protection. Notably, this version didn't come with its own mouse; Marks said they were working to support third-party mice as well as joystick and "touch pad" (presumably KoalaPad) options instead. Accounting for publishing delays, the Gazette piece would have been written several months prior in the fall of 1984 — after advertisements for the C64 version of Jane had been in multiple periodicals such as Creative Computing and Family Computing claiming you could purchase it already. In fact, the 64 version of Jane would never be released — it was simply cancelled once Commodore paid Arktronics to port it to the 128 and badged it as a Commodore product. As the 128's graphic and sound capabilities are virtually identical to the 64's in 40-column mode, save for the extra colour RAM, the port was relatively straightforward. (At the same time Commodore also rebadged the CP/M-based Perfect Software series from Thorn EMI for the 128, but this was non-exclusive, and their rebranded versions were exactly the same as sold for other CP/M-compatible systems. Goheen promised "comprehensive and professional developer support" for the new computer.) The new Jane could also be made cheaper: since the 128 is capable of autobooting a suitably coded floppy disk in drive 8, the cartridge could be dispensed with and the less expensive three-floppy scheme restored (though the grey disk was now called the "application disk"). A 128-mode 1541 fastloader is used if the new and much faster 1570 or 1571 disk drives aren't detected, though the 1571 still boots Jane noticeably faster than the fastloader. (Parenthetically, a frequent misconception is that the Z80 in the 128 does the boot sector check to start CP/M. In fact, the 8502 does that after the Z80 has already checked the Commodore key isn't down and entered 128 mode. In CP/M's case, the code in the CP/M disk boot sector instructs the 8502 to give control back to the Z80 so it can finish the boot sequence — if this weren't the case, the BASIC BOOT command wouldn't be able to start CP/M. Interestingly, 1581s booting CP/M have a special startup file to keep their own CP/M boot sector in a different location.) Otherwise, Jane 128 openly betrayed its origins on the 64: other than fastbooting with the 1571, which it mostly got for free, and support for the 128's new keys it took no advantage of any other 128 features, in particular no 2MHz support nor true VDC 80-column mode. Although the manual and box copy say using a mouse is supported, only the original 1350 mouse works, which strictly emulates a joystick. All three applications that were in the Apple II version are included. Under the hood the apps are implemented as overlays for a central kernel called JANEGM. Sadly, I didn't see any obvious credits while scanning through the disk files. The manual, which appears to have been written by a third party, insists on camelcasing the apps as JaneWrite, JaneCalc and JaneList even though the rear box copy doesn't distinguish them that way and the Apple II version and Arktronics' own advertising called them Janewrite, Janecalc and Janelist. I'll use the latter here. Commodore also included some official marketing material with the box, hawking their new 1902 monitor (with 80 column mode, which was useless for Jane), 1571 disk drive (which works well with Jane), 1670 Modem/1200 (which Jane doesn't use), 512K REU (which Jane doesn't use either) and the 1350 mouse — which in this photo is somewhat different-appearing than the released 1350/1351, and might have been a mockup. Actually, this system would have been a very nice 128 setup and very similar to the one we'll be using both for real and in VICE. Too bad Jane 128 could use relatively little of it. Both Jane and the Perfect series were demonstrated with the 128 for Winter CES 1985, though Commodore didn't announce MSRPs then for any of them at the time. It eventually emerged later that year for $49.95 [$150]; by the next year some retailers were selling it for as low as $35 [$100], compared to each of the Perfect titles then going for $45 apiece [$130]. Plus, the Perfect titles, being CP/M-based, were bland and text-based and failed to show off the C128's graphics, so Commodore ended up emphasizing Jane more in its contemporary marketing. Booting Jane 128 from the 128DCR's internal 1571 drive with my own 1902 monitor. Although its interface is similar to the Apple II's in broad strokes, Jane 128's most obvious difference is colour. However, there are numerous more subtle UI changes in this version, sufficient for it to be called "Jane 2.0" internally before release. We'll step through them here and in the next set of screenshots because they're an interesting comparison point to modern human interface practice. As with the Apple II, across the top of the screen are the various icons, or what the manual calls "pictures." These were slightly altered for the 128 from the Apple II originals. The blue icons again set the mode of the pointer ("tools") from the hand pointer, the insertion arrow, scissors (cut), camera (copy) and paste jar. The current tool is highlighted. You select a new tool by clicking on it, but you can also use the function keys (CLR/HOME, F1, F3, F5 and F7). By modern conventions Jane's tools are used backwards: instead of selecting a text range and "choosing a tool" (e.g., Command-C for copy) to operate on it, you choose a tool first and with that tool select the text range it operates on. I'll demonstrate this specific functionality in a couple instances, but any verb-object operation in Jane will work this way. (Linguistically, this makes Jane a head-initial language, while most modern GUIs are head-final.) Next to the tools are the main apps, Janewrite (now in purple), Janecalc (in green) and Janelist (in cyan), and next to them in grey are the same standard applets built into the kernel (online help, print dialogue, disk/file manager and setup). Finally, the STOP icon, now a solid red, stops the current app, and can be used to escape some screens, though not all. Unexpectedly it doesn't serve to quit Jane entirely: you just turn the computer off. Jane remembers what app is loaded and doesn't reload the overlay if you exit and re-enter it. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel and thus matching the grey system disk. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent. The first section looks like this. % hexdump -C w.TESTCONV 00000000 00 88 01 00 21 00 00 00 46 00 05 00 47 00 34 03 |....!...F...G.4.| 00000010 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * 00000030 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 05 00 04 02 0a 50 01 05 |. . . . .....P..| 00000040 3d 42 01 01 6e 81 61 6e 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 |=B..n.ana abr.e.| 00000050 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 6c 84 65 00 01 6e 00 61 | al.o. al.e..n.a| 00000060 00 6e 00 61 00 20 00 61 00 62 00 72 03 65 00 20 |.n.a. .a.b.r.e. | 00000070 00 61 00 6c 02 6f 00 20 00 61 00 6c 04 65 00 20 |.a.l.o. .a.l.e. | 00000080 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * Skipping the start address (this is indeed its location in bank 1), we again see some pieces of what looks like a buffer, as well as the file length (again minus the starting address) at byte offset 14. The left margin is (probably) at byte offset 6 because the right margin is at byte offset 8 (also a 16-bit LE short), followed by the paragraph indent. After this header, we now get the text, shown here in its entirety. 000000a0 00 20 00 49 74 20 77 61 73 20 61 20 64 61 72 6b |. .It was a dark| 000000b0 20 61 6e 64 20 73 74 6f 72 6d 79 20 6e 69 67 68 | and stormy nigh| 000000c0 74 2e 00 90 49 74 90 20 90 77 61 73 90 20 90 61 |t...It. .was. .a| 000000d0 90 20 90 64 61 72 6b 90 20 90 61 6e 64 90 20 90 |. .dark. .and. .| 000000e0 75 6e 64 65 72 6c 69 6e 65 64 90 20 90 73 74 6f |underlined. .sto| 000000f0 72 6d 79 90 20 90 6e 69 67 68 74 2e 00 88 49 74 |rmy. .night...It| 00000100 88 20 88 77 61 73 88 20 88 61 88 20 88 64 61 72 |. .was. .a. .dar| 00000110 6b 88 20 88 61 6e 64 88 20 88 62 6f 6c 64 88 20 |k. .and. .bold. | 00000120 88 73 74 6f 72 6d 79 88 20 88 6e 69 67 68 74 2e |.stormy. .night.| 00000130 00 98 49 74 98 20 98 77 61 73 98 20 98 61 98 20 |..It. .was. .a. | 00000140 98 64 61 72 6b 98 20 98 61 6e 64 98 20 98 62 6f |.dark. .and. .bo| 00000150 6c 64 98 20 98 61 6e 64 98 20 98 75 6e 64 65 72 |ld. .and. .under| 00000160 6c 69 6e 65 64 98 20 98 73 74 6f 72 6d 79 98 20 |lined. .stormy. | 00000170 98 6e 69 67 68 74 2e 00 00 a0 49 74 a0 20 a0 77 |.night....It. .w| 00000180 61 73 a0 20 a0 61 6c 73 6f a0 20 a0 73 75 70 65 |as. .also. .supe| 00000190 72 73 63 72 69 70 74 65 64 a0 20 20 c0 61 6e 64 |rscripted. .and| 000001a0 c0 20 c0 73 75 62 73 63 72 69 70 74 65 64 2e c0 |. .subscripted..| 000001b0 20 20 2e 2e 2e 20 62 75 74 20 6e 6f 74 20 62 6f | ... but not bo| 000001c0 74 68 2c 00 61 6e 64 20 6e 6f 74 20 63 6f 6d 62 |th,.and not comb| 000001d0 69 6e 65 64 20 77 69 74 68 20 75 6e 64 65 72 6c |ined with underl| 000001e0 69 6e 69 6e 67 20 6f 72 20 62 6f 6c 64 2e 00 00 |ining or bold...| 000001f0 48 65 20 6c 65 66 74 20 6a 75 73 74 69 66 69 65 |He left justifie| 00000200 64 20 68 69 6d 73 65 6c 66 2e 00 ff 58 48 65 20 |d himself...XHe | 00000210 72 69 67 68 74 20 6a 75 73 74 69 66 69 65 64 20 |right justified | 00000220 68 69 6d 73 65 6c 66 2e 00 ff 24 48 65 20 70 75 |himself...$He pu| 00000230 74 20 68 69 6d 73 65 6c 66 20 72 69 67 68 74 20 |t himself right | 00000240 69 6e 20 74 68 65 20 63 65 6e 74 72 65 2e 00 ff |in the centre...| 00000250 0a 48 65 20 6d 61 64 65 20 65 76 65 72 79 74 68 |.He made everyth| 00000260 69 6e 67 20 65 78 70 61 6e 64 20 6f 75 74 2c 20 |ing expand out, | 00000270 61 20 70 61 72 61 67 72 61 70 68 20 65 78 74 65 |a paragraph exte| 00000280 6e 64 69 6e 67 20 6f 76 65 72 20 6d 75 6c 74 69 |nding over multi| 00000290 70 6c 65 00 ff 0a 6c 69 6e 65 73 2c 20 61 20 66 |ple...lines, a f| 000002a0 72 61 67 6d 65 6e 74 20 74 68 61 74 20 62 65 63 |ragment that bec| 000002b0 61 6d 65 20 61 6e 20 69 63 6f 6e 20 75 6e 74 6f |ame an icon unto| 000002c0 20 69 74 73 65 6c 66 2e 00 00 61 82 61 86 61 87 | itself...a.a.a.| 000002d0 61 82 61 81 20 61 6e 64 20 6e 65 78 74 20 41 82 |a.a. and next A.| 000002e0 41 86 41 87 41 82 41 81 20 6e 65 78 74 20 6e 82 |A.A.A.A. next n.| 000002f0 6e 86 6e 87 6e 82 6e 81 20 6e 65 78 74 20 4e 82 |n.n.n.n. next N.| 00000300 4e 86 4e 87 4e 82 4e 81 20 6d 61 81 6e 81 61 6e |N.N.N.N. ma.n.an| 00000310 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 |a abr.e. al.o. a| 00000320 6c 84 65 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |l.e.............| 00000330 00 00 00 00 00 00 |......| Most of the document again can be trivially understood as null-delimited strings. Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. The failure of the Plus/4 to succeed the 64, much less overtake it, demonstrated clearly to Commodore management that 64 compatibility was essential in their next computer. Around this same time Sig Hartmann had noted the success of Atari's own first-party software unit Atarisoft on non-Atari platforms (though AtariLab was developed externally), even for the 64, and said there were similar plans to port Commodore first-party software and licenses to the Apple II, IBM PC and PCjr. (NARRATOR: This didn't happen.) However, by mid-1984 the software division had also developed a reputation for poor quality, with Scott Mace commenting in InfoWorld that — hits like International Soccer notwithstanding — "so far, the normal standard for Commodore software is mediocrity." In the meantime, Tramiel had bought the ailing Atari from Warner Communications and lured several Commodore managers, including Hartmann (who was already in conflict with Smith over cuts to the software division), to defect. Paul Goheen, the former systems software group head, became the new software chief. As the Commodore 128 neared completion, management constructed a new sales strategy to put it head to head against the Apple IIc and PCjr in specialty stores as well as Tramiel's favoured mass market retailers. To more plausibly bill it as a productivity machine, once again the software division had to look outside the company. Arktronics started in the dorms of the University of Michigan as a partnership between sophomore Robert "Bobby" Kotick and junior Howard Marks, who were then roommates. "We knew that unlike other industries," said Kotick in a 1984 interview, "there was a place for 19 and 20 year olds [in computers]." In July 1983 the company was formed to capitalize on Marks' ideas to envision a friendlier user interface for productivity applications. Marks, who was French, had previously worked for Apple and had access to its peripherals, including the then-novel use of a mouse as a pointer device. "This was way before there was ever a Lisa," Kotick added. "We realized that the biggest problem was that people like us couldn't use these things [computers] yet because they were too difficult and time-consuming to learn." They crafted a wish list and design document oriented to systems with 64K of RAM or less but featuring a picture (now we'd say icon-based) interface driven by a pointing device, such as a joystick or mouse, and an extensive on-line tutorial. Marks and Kotick hired students and even lured away some professors to work on the application, christened Jane after the Dick and Jane introductory reading books, who accepted shares in the company in lieu of salary. To fund development by their team of about thirty, Kotick tagged along with a friend to the annual Cattle Baron's Ball in Dallas at which he met real estate and casino investor Steve Wynn. Kotick managed to hitch a ride back to the East Coast on Wynn's plane where he pitched him on their company and Wynn encouraged him to write up a business plan. Three months later Marks and Kotick were summoned to Wynn's offices in Manhattan and flown to Atlantic City, whereupon Wynn handed them a cheque for $300,000 (in 2025 approximately $970,000) in exchange for a third of the company, providing business advice as the product progressed. Jane missed a first deadline for Comdex in December 1983 due to testing delays and finally launched at Softcon in February 1984 for the Apple II/II+ with 64K and the IIe at an MSRP of $295 [$920], later reduced to $179 [$560]. The program shipped on three colour-coded floppies, a grey bootable "systems disk" containing the word processor, database and spreadsheet applications (Janewrite, Janelist and Janecalc, respectively), a yellow "help disk" with the tutorial, and a black "data disk" for the user to save files. To ease the need for disk swapping, it would hunt for the right disk in either disk drive if you had two. Versions for the IBM PC and Atari 8-bits were said to be in progress. The initial release was uniquely accompanied by its own single-button mouse (Instagram link), a lower-cost unit — Kotick admitted settling for "a lesser quality product" — manufactured under contract by joystick maker Wico and incompatible with Apple's own later mouse options. This mouse interfaced to the Apple with a custom card and an 8-pin connector. Jane's appearance at the show attracted attention from another Steve, but at the Apple booth instead: Steve Jobs. Jobs visited the company in Ann Arbor and, suitably impressed, told Kotick and Marks they were wasting their time in college. Kotick duly dropped out to concentrate on the company, much to the consternation of his parents. Because it was intended to run on any existing Apple II with sufficient RAM, pretty much nothing was assumed about the hardware. It displayed strictly in monochrome and used the Apple hi-res mode to display upper and lowercase since the II/II+'s text mode was purely uppercase. Additionally, as 80-column capability wasn't universal, it used a software text shaper to display 60-column text in the word processor and, here, in the file requester. Basic windows like these, with title and information in the actual window bars, served for dialogue boxes and file selection. Although no emulator presently supports Jane's oddball original mouse, the PBS MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour did a piece on Arktronics in 1984 (the photo above of Marks and an open Apple II case is from this clip) and, along with pictures of the Arktronics offices which I've scattered throughout this article, had some screenshots that illustrate its capabilities. Here a document is being edited in Janewrite. You can see close, scroll and size gadgets in the window frame, but interestingly the control to maximize the current window is in the lower right. The top of the screen shows the editing tools (hand pointer, arrow, scissors [cut], camera [copy] and paste jar), icons for the three core apps, and then system-wide icons for on-line help, printing, the file manager, preferences and "STOP" to globally cancel an operation. Across the bottom, beside the window maximize gadget, are tools for adjusting line justification, font style (bold, underline, bold and underline, superscript, subscript), print settings and search. I'll have more to say about all of these when we get to Jane's Commodore port. Document windows could also be moved and resized, and multiple windows from different Jane applications could be open simultaneously. If you hit Control-Reset, a Easter egg briefly flashes on-screen with the names of the Apple II programmers: Mike Lagae, John R. Haggis, Brent Iverson, Jim Poje, Peter Lee, Uwe Pleban, Allen Leibowitz and Ken Roe. Because portability to other, sometimes wildly different, systems was always contemplated, application-level components were written in a high level language and compiled for the target (allegedly an early microcomputer dialect of C), with the graphics and I/O drivers written directly in assembly. With the release of the IIc Arktronics updated the program to support Apple's mouse as well. Reviews of the Apple II version were decidedly mixed. In June 1984, InfoWorld called it "innovative" but also observed that "overbearing use of icons, some slow features, and some awkwardness mar the product, which could benefit from an emphasis on efficiency rather than gimmickry." Down under, Your Computer in November 1984 liked the simple interface and believed it would appeal to undemanding users but criticized the 236-page manual and found the mouse unreliable. "When the mouse works properly, it is good," wrote reviewer Evan McHugh, but "when it doesn't it's the pits." Likewise, although A+'s 1985 review also liked the interface and the fact that multiple windows from each module could be open at once, the magazine also felt that "the individual modules in Jane are not up to professional productivity quality." Perhaps because of the software display, Janewrite "was too slow to respond to the keystrokes of a moderately proficient typist," and Janecalc, equally slow, was also panned as "crippled" because it only supported a 24x20 maximum spreadsheet. "Thank you, Jane," quipped reviewer Danny Goodman, "[l]eave your number at the door." Jane was also billed as available for the Commodore 64, even in contemporary advertising, but COMPUTE!'s Gazette in January 1985 said it was "scheduled to be released for the Commodore 64 by the time you read this. The price is expected to be about $80 [$240]." Interviewed for the article, Marks said that Jane for the 64 was to come as a combination cartridge and disk package, where a "32K plug-in cartridge" would quickly and automatically bring up the system. The article claimed the cartridge would autoboot the applications from (now) just a single floppy plus the data disk, though I suspect the actual configuration was that the cartridge contained the applications and the disk contained the online tutorial, simultaneously furnishing a modicum of both instant access and copy protection. Notably, this version didn't come with its own mouse; Marks said they were working to support third-party mice as well as joystick and "touch pad" (presumably KoalaPad) options instead. Accounting for publishing delays, the Gazette piece would have been written several months prior in the fall of 1984 — after advertisements for the C64 version of Jane had been in multiple periodicals such as Creative Computing and Family Computing claiming you could purchase it already. In fact, the 64 version of Jane would never be released — it was simply cancelled once Commodore paid Arktronics to port it to the 128 and badged it as a Commodore product. As the 128's graphic and sound capabilities are virtually identical to the 64's in 40-column mode, save for the extra colour RAM, the port was relatively straightforward. (At the same time Commodore also rebadged the CP/M-based Perfect Software series from Thorn EMI for the 128, but this was non-exclusive, and their rebranded versions were exactly the same as sold for other CP/M-compatible systems. Goheen promised "comprehensive and professional developer support" for the new computer.) The new Jane could also be made cheaper: since the 128 is capable of autobooting a suitably coded floppy disk in drive 8, the cartridge could be dispensed with and the less expensive three-floppy scheme restored (though the grey disk was now called the "application disk"). A 128-mode 1541 fastloader is used if the new and much faster 1570 or 1571 disk drives aren't detected, though the 1571 still boots Jane noticeably faster than the fastloader. (Parenthetically, a frequent misconception is that the Z80 in the 128 does the boot sector check to start CP/M. In fact, the 8502 does that after the Z80 has already checked the Commodore key isn't down and entered 128 mode. In CP/M's case, the code in the CP/M disk boot sector instructs the 8502 to give control back to the Z80 so it can finish the boot sequence — if this weren't the case, the BASIC BOOT command wouldn't be able to start CP/M. Interestingly, 1581s booting CP/M have a special startup file to keep their own CP/M boot sector in a different location.) Otherwise, Jane 128 openly betrayed its origins on the 64: other than fastbooting with the 1571, which it mostly got for free, and support for the 128's new keys it took no advantage of any other 128 features, in particular no 2MHz support nor true VDC 80-column mode. Although the manual and box copy say using a mouse is supported, only the original 1350 mouse works, which strictly emulates a joystick. All three applications that were in the Apple II version are included. Under the hood the apps are implemented as overlays for a central kernel called JANEGM. Sadly, I didn't see any obvious credits while scanning through the disk files. The manual, which appears to have been written by a third party, insists on camelcasing the apps as JaneWrite, JaneCalc and JaneList even though the rear box copy doesn't distinguish them that way and the Apple II version and Arktronics' own advertising called them Janewrite, Janecalc and Janelist. I'll use the latter here. Commodore also included some official marketing material with the box, hawking their new 1902 monitor (with 80 column mode, which was useless for Jane), 1571 disk drive (which works well with Jane), 1670 Modem/1200 (which Jane doesn't use), 512K REU (which Jane doesn't use either) and the 1350 mouse — which in this photo is somewhat different-appearing than the released 1350/1351, and might have been a mockup. Actually, this system would have been a very nice 128 setup and very similar to the one we'll be using both for real and in VICE. Too bad Jane 128 could use relatively little of it. Both Jane and the Perfect series were demonstrated with the 128 for Winter CES 1985, though Commodore didn't announce MSRPs then for any of them at the time. It eventually emerged later that year for $49.95 [$150]; by the next year some retailers were selling it for as low as $35 [$100], compared to each of the Perfect titles then going for $45 apiece [$130]. Plus, the Perfect titles, being CP/M-based, were bland and text-based and failed to show off the C128's graphics, so Commodore ended up emphasizing Jane more in its contemporary marketing. Booting Jane 128 from the 128DCR's internal 1571 drive with my own 1902 monitor. Although its interface is similar to the Apple II's in broad strokes, Jane 128's most obvious difference is colour. However, there are numerous more subtle UI changes in this version, sufficient for it to be called "Jane 2.0" internally before release. We'll step through them here and in the next set of screenshots because they're an interesting comparison point to modern human interface practice. As with the Apple II, across the top of the screen are the various icons, or what the manual calls "pictures." These were slightly altered for the 128 from the Apple II originals. The blue icons again set the mode of the pointer ("tools") from the hand pointer, the insertion arrow, scissors (cut), camera (copy) and paste jar. The current tool is highlighted. You select a new tool by clicking on it, but you can also use the function keys (CLR/HOME, F1, F3, F5 and F7). By modern conventions Jane's tools are used backwards: instead of selecting a text range and "choosing a tool" (e.g., Command-C for copy) to operate on it, you choose a tool first and with that tool select the text range it operates on. I'll demonstrate this specific functionality in a couple instances, but any verb-object operation in Jane will work this way. (Linguistically, this makes Jane a head-initial language, while most modern GUIs are head-final.) Next to the tools are the main apps, Janewrite (now in purple), Janecalc (in green) and Janelist (in cyan), and next to them in grey are the same standard applets built into the kernel (online help, print dialogue, disk/file manager and setup). Finally, the STOP icon, now a solid red, stops the current app, and can be used to escape some screens, though not all. Unexpectedly it doesn't serve to quit Jane entirely: you just turn the computer off. Jane remembers what app is loaded and doesn't reload the overlay if you exit and re-enter it. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel and thus matching the grey system disk. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record. Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. As the Commodore 128 neared completion, management constructed a new sales strategy to put it head to head against the Apple IIc and PCjr in specialty stores as well as Tramiel's favoured mass market retailers. To more plausibly bill it as a productivity machine, once again the software division had to look outside the company. Arktronics started in the dorms of the University of Michigan as a partnership between sophomore Robert "Bobby" Kotick and junior Howard Marks, who were then roommates. "We knew that unlike other industries," said Kotick in a 1984 interview, "there was a place for 19 and 20 year olds [in computers]." In July 1983 the company was formed to capitalize on Marks' ideas to envision a friendlier user interface for productivity applications. Marks, who was French, had previously worked for Apple and had access to its peripherals, including the then-novel use of a mouse as a pointer device. "This was way before there was ever a Lisa," Kotick added. "We realized that the biggest problem was that people like us couldn't use these things [computers] yet because they were too difficult and time-consuming to learn." They crafted a wish list and design document oriented to systems with 64K of RAM or less but featuring a picture (now we'd say icon-based) interface driven by a pointing device, such as a joystick or mouse, and an extensive on-line tutorial. Marks and Kotick hired students and even lured away some professors to work on the application, christened Jane after the Dick and Jane introductory reading books, who accepted shares in the company in lieu of salary. To fund development by their team of about thirty, Kotick tagged along with a friend to the annual Cattle Baron's Ball in Dallas at which he met real estate and casino investor Steve Wynn. Kotick managed to hitch a ride back to the East Coast on Wynn's plane where he pitched him on their company and Wynn encouraged him to write up a business plan. Three months later Marks and Kotick were summoned to Wynn's offices in Manhattan and flown to Atlantic City, whereupon Wynn handed them a cheque for $300,000 (in 2025 approximately $970,000) in exchange for a third of the company, providing business advice as the product progressed. Jane missed a first deadline for Comdex in December 1983 due to testing delays and finally launched at Softcon in February 1984 for the Apple II/II+ with 64K and the IIe at an MSRP of $295 [$920], later reduced to $179 [$560]. The program shipped on three colour-coded floppies, a grey bootable "systems disk" containing the word processor, database and spreadsheet applications (Janewrite, Janelist and Janecalc, respectively), a yellow "help disk" with the tutorial, and a black "data disk" for the user to save files. To ease the need for disk swapping, it would hunt for the right disk in either disk drive if you had two. Versions for the IBM PC and Atari 8-bits were said to be in progress. The initial release was uniquely accompanied by its own single-button mouse (Instagram link), a lower-cost unit — Kotick admitted settling for "a lesser quality product" — manufactured under contract by joystick maker Wico and incompatible with Apple's own later mouse options. This mouse interfaced to the Apple with a custom card and an 8-pin connector. Jane's appearance at the show attracted attention from another Steve, but at the Apple booth instead: Steve Jobs. Jobs visited the company in Ann Arbor and, suitably impressed, told Kotick and Marks they were wasting their time in college. Kotick duly dropped out to concentrate on the company, much to the consternation of his parents. Because it was intended to run on any existing Apple II with sufficient RAM, pretty much nothing was assumed about the hardware. It displayed strictly in monochrome and used the Apple hi-res mode to display upper and lowercase since the II/II+'s text mode was purely uppercase. Additionally, as 80-column capability wasn't universal, it used a software text shaper to display 60-column text in the word processor and, here, in the file requester. Basic windows like these, with title and information in the actual window bars, served for dialogue boxes and file selection. Although no emulator presently supports Jane's oddball original mouse, the PBS MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour did a piece on Arktronics in 1984 (the photo above of Marks and an open Apple II case is from this clip) and, along with pictures of the Arktronics offices which I've scattered throughout this article, had some screenshots that illustrate its capabilities. Here a document is being edited in Janewrite. You can see close, scroll and size gadgets in the window frame, but interestingly the control to maximize the current window is in the lower right. The top of the screen shows the editing tools (hand pointer, arrow, scissors [cut], camera [copy] and paste jar), icons for the three core apps, and then system-wide icons for on-line help, printing, the file manager, preferences and "STOP" to globally cancel an operation. Across the bottom, beside the window maximize gadget, are tools for adjusting line justification, font style (bold, underline, bold and underline, superscript, subscript), print settings and search. I'll have more to say about all of these when we get to Jane's Commodore port. Document windows could also be moved and resized, and multiple windows from different Jane applications could be open simultaneously. If you hit Control-Reset, a Easter egg briefly flashes on-screen with the names of the Apple II programmers: Mike Lagae, John R. Haggis, Brent Iverson, Jim Poje, Peter Lee, Uwe Pleban, Allen Leibowitz and Ken Roe. Because portability to other, sometimes wildly different, systems was always contemplated, application-level components were written in a high level language and compiled for the target (allegedly an early microcomputer dialect of C), with the graphics and I/O drivers written directly in assembly. With the release of the IIc Arktronics updated the program to support Apple's mouse as well. Reviews of the Apple II version were decidedly mixed. In June 1984, InfoWorld called it "innovative" but also observed that "overbearing use of icons, some slow features, and some awkwardness mar the product, which could benefit from an emphasis on efficiency rather than gimmickry." Down under, Your Computer in November 1984 liked the simple interface and believed it would appeal to undemanding users but criticized the 236-page manual and found the mouse unreliable. "When the mouse works properly, it is good," wrote reviewer Evan McHugh, but "when it doesn't it's the pits." Likewise, although A+'s 1985 review also liked the interface and the fact that multiple windows from each module could be open at once, the magazine also felt that "the individual modules in Jane are not up to professional productivity quality." Perhaps because of the software display, Janewrite "was too slow to respond to the keystrokes of a moderately proficient typist," and Janecalc, equally slow, was also panned as "crippled" because it only supported a 24x20 maximum spreadsheet. "Thank you, Jane," quipped reviewer Danny Goodman, "[l]eave your number at the door." Jane was also billed as available for the Commodore 64, even in contemporary advertising, but COMPUTE!'s Gazette in January 1985 said it was "scheduled to be released for the Commodore 64 by the time you read this. The price is expected to be about $80 [$240]." Interviewed for the article, Marks said that Jane for the 64 was to come as a combination cartridge and disk package, where a "32K plug-in cartridge" would quickly and automatically bring up the system. The article claimed the cartridge would autoboot the applications from (now) just a single floppy plus the data disk, though I suspect the actual configuration was that the cartridge contained the applications and the disk contained the online tutorial, simultaneously furnishing a modicum of both instant access and copy protection. Notably, this version didn't come with its own mouse; Marks said they were working to support third-party mice as well as joystick and "touch pad" (presumably KoalaPad) options instead. Accounting for publishing delays, the Gazette piece would have been written several months prior in the fall of 1984 — after advertisements for the C64 version of Jane had been in multiple periodicals such as Creative Computing and Family Computing claiming you could purchase it already. In fact, the 64 version of Jane would never be released — it was simply cancelled once Commodore paid Arktronics to port it to the 128 and badged it as a Commodore product. As the 128's graphic and sound capabilities are virtually identical to the 64's in 40-column mode, save for the extra colour RAM, the port was relatively straightforward. (At the same time Commodore also rebadged the CP/M-based Perfect Software series from Thorn EMI for the 128, but this was non-exclusive, and their rebranded versions were exactly the same as sold for other CP/M-compatible systems. Goheen promised "comprehensive and professional developer support" for the new computer.) The new Jane could also be made cheaper: since the 128 is capable of autobooting a suitably coded floppy disk in drive 8, the cartridge could be dispensed with and the less expensive three-floppy scheme restored (though the grey disk was now called the "application disk"). A 128-mode 1541 fastloader is used if the new and much faster 1570 or 1571 disk drives aren't detected, though the 1571 still boots Jane noticeably faster than the fastloader. (Parenthetically, a frequent misconception is that the Z80 in the 128 does the boot sector check to start CP/M. In fact, the 8502 does that after the Z80 has already checked the Commodore key isn't down and entered 128 mode. In CP/M's case, the code in the CP/M disk boot sector instructs the 8502 to give control back to the Z80 so it can finish the boot sequence — if this weren't the case, the BASIC BOOT command wouldn't be able to start CP/M. Interestingly, 1581s booting CP/M have a special startup file to keep their own CP/M boot sector in a different location.) Otherwise, Jane 128 openly betrayed its origins on the 64: other than fastbooting with the 1571, which it mostly got for free, and support for the 128's new keys it took no advantage of any other 128 features, in particular no 2MHz support nor true VDC 80-column mode. Although the manual and box copy say using a mouse is supported, only the original 1350 mouse works, which strictly emulates a joystick. All three applications that were in the Apple II version are included. Under the hood the apps are implemented as overlays for a central kernel called JANEGM. Sadly, I didn't see any obvious credits while scanning through the disk files. The manual, which appears to have been written by a third party, insists on camelcasing the apps as JaneWrite, JaneCalc and JaneList even though the rear box copy doesn't distinguish them that way and the Apple II version and Arktronics' own advertising called them Janewrite, Janecalc and Janelist. I'll use the latter here. Commodore also included some official marketing material with the box, hawking their new 1902 monitor (with 80 column mode, which was useless for Jane), 1571 disk drive (which works well with Jane), 1670 Modem/1200 (which Jane doesn't use), 512K REU (which Jane doesn't use either) and the 1350 mouse — which in this photo is somewhat different-appearing than the released 1350/1351, and might have been a mockup. Actually, this system would have been a very nice 128 setup and very similar to the one we'll be using both for real and in VICE. Too bad Jane 128 could use relatively little of it. Both Jane and the Perfect series were demonstrated with the 128 for Winter CES 1985, though Commodore didn't announce MSRPs then for any of them at the time. It eventually emerged later that year for $49.95 [$150]; by the next year some retailers were selling it for as low as $35 [$100], compared to each of the Perfect titles then going for $45 apiece [$130]. Plus, the Perfect titles, being CP/M-based, were bland and text-based and failed to show off the C128's graphics, so Commodore ended up emphasizing Jane more in its contemporary marketing. Booting Jane 128 from the 128DCR's internal 1571 drive with my own 1902 monitor. Although its interface is similar to the Apple II's in broad strokes, Jane 128's most obvious difference is colour. However, there are numerous more subtle UI changes in this version, sufficient for it to be called "Jane 2.0" internally before release. We'll step through them here and in the next set of screenshots because they're an interesting comparison point to modern human interface practice. As with the Apple II, across the top of the screen are the various icons, or what the manual calls "pictures." These were slightly altered for the 128 from the Apple II originals. The blue icons again set the mode of the pointer ("tools") from the hand pointer, the insertion arrow, scissors (cut), camera (copy) and paste jar. The current tool is highlighted. You select a new tool by clicking on it, but you can also use the function keys (CLR/HOME, F1, F3, F5 and F7). By modern conventions Jane's tools are used backwards: instead of selecting a text range and "choosing a tool" (e.g., Command-C for copy) to operate on it, you choose a tool first and with that tool select the text range it operates on. I'll demonstrate this specific functionality in a couple instances, but any verb-object operation in Jane will work this way. (Linguistically, this makes Jane a head-initial language, while most modern GUIs are head-final.) Next to the tools are the main apps, Janewrite (now in purple), Janecalc (in green) and Janelist (in cyan), and next to them in grey are the same standard applets built into the kernel (online help, print dialogue, disk/file manager and setup). Finally, the STOP icon, now a solid red, stops the current app, and can be used to escape some screens, though not all. Unexpectedly it doesn't serve to quit Jane entirely: you just turn the computer off. Jane remembers what app is loaded and doesn't reload the overlay if you exit and re-enter it. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel and thus matching the grey system disk. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. The initial release was uniquely accompanied by its own single-button mouse (Instagram link), a lower-cost unit — Kotick admitted settling for "a lesser quality product" — manufactured under contract by joystick maker Wico and incompatible with Apple's own later mouse options. This mouse interfaced to the Apple with a custom card and an 8-pin connector. Jane's appearance at the show attracted attention from another Steve, but at the Apple booth instead: Steve Jobs. Jobs visited the company in Ann Arbor and, suitably impressed, told Kotick and Marks they were wasting their time in college. Kotick duly dropped out to concentrate on the company, much to the consternation of his parents. Because it was intended to run on any existing Apple II with sufficient RAM, pretty much nothing was assumed about the hardware. It displayed strictly in monochrome and used the Apple hi-res mode to display upper and lowercase since the II/II+'s text mode was purely uppercase. Additionally, as 80-column capability wasn't universal, it used a software text shaper to display 60-column text in the word processor and, here, in the file requester. Basic windows like these, with title and information in the actual window bars, served for dialogue boxes and file selection. Although no emulator presently supports Jane's oddball original mouse, the PBS MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour did a piece on Arktronics in 1984 (the photo above of Marks and an open Apple II case is from this clip) and, along with pictures of the Arktronics offices which I've scattered throughout this article, had some screenshots that illustrate its capabilities. Here a document is being edited in Janewrite. You can see close, scroll and size gadgets in the window frame, but interestingly the control to maximize the current window is in the lower right. The top of the screen shows the editing tools (hand pointer, arrow, scissors [cut], camera [copy] and paste jar), icons for the three core apps, and then system-wide icons for on-line help, printing, the file manager, preferences and "STOP" to globally cancel an operation. Across the bottom, beside the window maximize gadget, are tools for adjusting line justification, font style (bold, underline, bold and underline, superscript, subscript), print settings and search. I'll have more to say about all of these when we get to Jane's Commodore port. Document windows could also be moved and resized, and multiple windows from different Jane applications could be open simultaneously. If you hit Control-Reset, a Easter egg briefly flashes on-screen with the names of the Apple II programmers: Mike Lagae, John R. Haggis, Brent Iverson, Jim Poje, Peter Lee, Uwe Pleban, Allen Leibowitz and Ken Roe. Because portability to other, sometimes wildly different, systems was always contemplated, application-level components were written in a high level language and compiled for the target (allegedly an early microcomputer dialect of C), with the graphics and I/O drivers written directly in assembly. With the release of the IIc Arktronics updated the program to support Apple's mouse as well. Reviews of the Apple II version were decidedly mixed. In June 1984, InfoWorld called it "innovative" but also observed that "overbearing use of icons, some slow features, and some awkwardness mar the product, which could benefit from an emphasis on efficiency rather than gimmickry." Down under, Your Computer in November 1984 liked the simple interface and believed it would appeal to undemanding users but criticized the 236-page manual and found the mouse unreliable. "When the mouse works properly, it is good," wrote reviewer Evan McHugh, but "when it doesn't it's the pits." Likewise, although A+'s 1985 review also liked the interface and the fact that multiple windows from each module could be open at once, the magazine also felt that "the individual modules in Jane are not up to professional productivity quality." Perhaps because of the software display, Janewrite "was too slow to respond to the keystrokes of a moderately proficient typist," and Janecalc, equally slow, was also panned as "crippled" because it only supported a 24x20 maximum spreadsheet. "Thank you, Jane," quipped reviewer Danny Goodman, "[l]eave your number at the door." Jane was also billed as available for the Commodore 64, even in contemporary advertising, but COMPUTE!'s Gazette in January 1985 said it was "scheduled to be released for the Commodore 64 by the time you read this. The price is expected to be about $80 [$240]." Interviewed for the article, Marks said that Jane for the 64 was to come as a combination cartridge and disk package, where a "32K plug-in cartridge" would quickly and automatically bring up the system. The article claimed the cartridge would autoboot the applications from (now) just a single floppy plus the data disk, though I suspect the actual configuration was that the cartridge contained the applications and the disk contained the online tutorial, simultaneously furnishing a modicum of both instant access and copy protection. Notably, this version didn't come with its own mouse; Marks said they were working to support third-party mice as well as joystick and "touch pad" (presumably KoalaPad) options instead. Accounting for publishing delays, the Gazette piece would have been written several months prior in the fall of 1984 — after advertisements for the C64 version of Jane had been in multiple periodicals such as Creative Computing and Family Computing claiming you could purchase it already. In fact, the 64 version of Jane would never be released — it was simply cancelled once Commodore paid Arktronics to port it to the 128 and badged it as a Commodore product. As the 128's graphic and sound capabilities are virtually identical to the 64's in 40-column mode, save for the extra colour RAM, the port was relatively straightforward. (At the same time Commodore also rebadged the CP/M-based Perfect Software series from Thorn EMI for the 128, but this was non-exclusive, and their rebranded versions were exactly the same as sold for other CP/M-compatible systems. Goheen promised "comprehensive and professional developer support" for the new computer.) The new Jane could also be made cheaper: since the 128 is capable of autobooting a suitably coded floppy disk in drive 8, the cartridge could be dispensed with and the less expensive three-floppy scheme restored (though the grey disk was now called the "application disk"). A 128-mode 1541 fastloader is used if the new and much faster 1570 or 1571 disk drives aren't detected, though the 1571 still boots Jane noticeably faster than the fastloader. (Parenthetically, a frequent misconception is that the Z80 in the 128 does the boot sector check to start CP/M. In fact, the 8502 does that after the Z80 has already checked the Commodore key isn't down and entered 128 mode. In CP/M's case, the code in the CP/M disk boot sector instructs the 8502 to give control back to the Z80 so it can finish the boot sequence — if this weren't the case, the BASIC BOOT command wouldn't be able to start CP/M. Interestingly, 1581s booting CP/M have a special startup file to keep their own CP/M boot sector in a different location.) Otherwise, Jane 128 openly betrayed its origins on the 64: other than fastbooting with the 1571, which it mostly got for free, and support for the 128's new keys it took no advantage of any other 128 features, in particular no 2MHz support nor true VDC 80-column mode. Although the manual and box copy say using a mouse is supported, only the original 1350 mouse works, which strictly emulates a joystick. All three applications that were in the Apple II version are included. Under the hood the apps are implemented as overlays for a central kernel called JANEGM. Sadly, I didn't see any obvious credits while scanning through the disk files. The manual, which appears to have been written by a third party, insists on camelcasing the apps as JaneWrite, JaneCalc and JaneList even though the rear box copy doesn't distinguish them that way and the Apple II version and Arktronics' own advertising called them Janewrite, Janecalc and Janelist. I'll use the latter here. Commodore also included some official marketing material with the box, hawking their new 1902 monitor (with 80 column mode, which was useless for Jane), 1571 disk drive (which works well with Jane), 1670 Modem/1200 (which Jane doesn't use), 512K REU (which Jane doesn't use either) and the 1350 mouse — which in this photo is somewhat different-appearing than the released 1350/1351, and might have been a mockup. Actually, this system would have been a very nice 128 setup and very similar to the one we'll be using both for real and in VICE. Too bad Jane 128 could use relatively little of it. Both Jane and the Perfect series were demonstrated with the 128 for Winter CES 1985, though Commodore didn't announce MSRPs then for any of them at the time. It eventually emerged later that year for $49.95 [$150]; by the next year some retailers were selling it for as low as $35 [$100], compared to each of the Perfect titles then going for $45 apiece [$130]. Plus, the Perfect titles, being CP/M-based, were bland and text-based and failed to show off the C128's graphics, so Commodore ended up emphasizing Jane more in its contemporary marketing. Booting Jane 128 from the 128DCR's internal 1571 drive with my own 1902 monitor. Although its interface is similar to the Apple II's in broad strokes, Jane 128's most obvious difference is colour. However, there are numerous more subtle UI changes in this version, sufficient for it to be called "Jane 2.0" internally before release. We'll step through them here and in the next set of screenshots because they're an interesting comparison point to modern human interface practice. As with the Apple II, across the top of the screen are the various icons, or what the manual calls "pictures." These were slightly altered for the 128 from the Apple II originals. The blue icons again set the mode of the pointer ("tools") from the hand pointer, the insertion arrow, scissors (cut), camera (copy) and paste jar. The current tool is highlighted. You select a new tool by clicking on it, but you can also use the function keys (CLR/HOME, F1, F3, F5 and F7). By modern conventions Jane's tools are used backwards: instead of selecting a text range and "choosing a tool" (e.g., Command-C for copy) to operate on it, you choose a tool first and with that tool select the text range it operates on. I'll demonstrate this specific functionality in a couple instances, but any verb-object operation in Jane will work this way. (Linguistically, this makes Jane a head-initial language, while most modern GUIs are head-final.) Next to the tools are the main apps, Janewrite (now in purple), Janecalc (in green) and Janelist (in cyan), and next to them in grey are the same standard applets built into the kernel (online help, print dialogue, disk/file manager and setup). Finally, the STOP icon, now a solid red, stops the current app, and can be used to escape some screens, though not all. Unexpectedly it doesn't serve to quit Jane entirely: you just turn the computer off. Jane remembers what app is loaded and doesn't reload the overlay if you exit and re-enter it. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel and thus matching the grey system disk. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated.

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. The top of the screen shows the editing tools (hand pointer, arrow, scissors [cut], camera [copy] and paste jar), icons for the three core apps, and then system-wide icons for on-line help, printing, the file manager, preferences and "STOP" to globally cancel an operation. Across the bottom, beside the window maximize gadget, are tools for adjusting line justification, font style (bold, underline, bold and underline, superscript, subscript), print settings and search. I'll have more to say about all of these when we get to Jane's Commodore port. Document windows could also be moved and resized, and multiple windows from different Jane applications could be open simultaneously. If you hit Control-Reset, a Easter egg briefly flashes on-screen with the names of the Apple II programmers: Mike Lagae, John R. Haggis, Brent Iverson, Jim Poje, Peter Lee, Uwe Pleban, Allen Leibowitz and Ken Roe. Because portability to other, sometimes wildly different, systems was always contemplated, application-level components were written in a high level language and compiled for the target (allegedly an early microcomputer dialect of C), with the graphics and I/O drivers written directly in assembly. With the release of the IIc Arktronics updated the program to support Apple's mouse as well. Reviews of the Apple II version were decidedly mixed. In June 1984, InfoWorld called it "innovative" but also observed that "overbearing use of icons, some slow features, and some awkwardness mar the product, which could benefit from an emphasis on efficiency rather than gimmickry." Down under, Your Computer in November 1984 liked the simple interface and believed it would appeal to undemanding users but criticized the 236-page manual and found the mouse unreliable. "When the mouse works properly, it is good," wrote reviewer Evan McHugh, but "when it doesn't it's the pits." Likewise, although A+'s 1985 review also liked the interface and the fact that multiple windows from each module could be open at once, the magazine also felt that "the individual modules in Jane are not up to professional productivity quality." Perhaps because of the software display, Janewrite "was too slow to respond to the keystrokes of a moderately proficient typist," and Janecalc, equally slow, was also panned as "crippled" because it only supported a 24x20 maximum spreadsheet. "Thank you, Jane," quipped reviewer Danny Goodman, "[l]eave your number at the door." Jane was also billed as available for the Commodore 64, even in contemporary advertising, but COMPUTE!'s Gazette in January 1985 said it was "scheduled to be released for the Commodore 64 by the time you read this. The price is expected to be about $80 [$240]." Interviewed for the article, Marks said that Jane for the 64 was to come as a combination cartridge and disk package, where a "32K plug-in cartridge" would quickly and automatically bring up the system. The article claimed the cartridge would autoboot the applications from (now) just a single floppy plus the data disk, though I suspect the actual configuration was that the cartridge contained the applications and the disk contained the online tutorial, simultaneously furnishing a modicum of both instant access and copy protection. Notably, this version didn't come with its own mouse; Marks said they were working to support third-party mice as well as joystick and "touch pad" (presumably KoalaPad) options instead. Accounting for publishing delays, the Gazette piece would have been written several months prior in the fall of 1984 — after advertisements for the C64 version of Jane had been in multiple periodicals such as Creative Computing and Family Computing claiming you could purchase it already. In fact, the 64 version of Jane would never be released — it was simply cancelled once Commodore paid Arktronics to port it to the 128 and badged it as a Commodore product. As the 128's graphic and sound capabilities are virtually identical to the 64's in 40-column mode, save for the extra colour RAM, the port was relatively straightforward. (At the same time Commodore also rebadged the CP/M-based Perfect Software series from Thorn EMI for the 128, but this was non-exclusive, and their rebranded versions were exactly the same as sold for other CP/M-compatible systems. Goheen promised "comprehensive and professional developer support" for the new computer.) The new Jane could also be made cheaper: since the 128 is capable of autobooting a suitably coded floppy disk in drive 8, the cartridge could be dispensed with and the less expensive three-floppy scheme restored (though the grey disk was now called the "application disk"). A 128-mode 1541 fastloader is used if the new and much faster 1570 or 1571 disk drives aren't detected, though the 1571 still boots Jane noticeably faster than the fastloader. (Parenthetically, a frequent misconception is that the Z80 in the 128 does the boot sector check to start CP/M. In fact, the 8502 does that after the Z80 has already checked the Commodore key isn't down and entered 128 mode. In CP/M's case, the code in the CP/M disk boot sector instructs the 8502 to give control back to the Z80 so it can finish the boot sequence — if this weren't the case, the BASIC BOOT command wouldn't be able to start CP/M. Interestingly, 1581s booting CP/M have a special startup file to keep their own CP/M boot sector in a different location.) Otherwise, Jane 128 openly betrayed its origins on the 64: other than fastbooting with the 1571, which it mostly got for free, and support for the 128's new keys it took no advantage of any other 128 features, in particular no 2MHz support nor true VDC 80-column mode. Although the manual and box copy say using a mouse is supported, only the original 1350 mouse works, which strictly emulates a joystick. All three applications that were in the Apple II version are included. Under the hood the apps are implemented as overlays for a central kernel called JANEGM. Sadly, I didn't see any obvious credits while scanning through the disk files. The manual, which appears to have been written by a third party, insists on camelcasing the apps as JaneWrite, JaneCalc and JaneList even though the rear box copy doesn't distinguish them that way and the Apple II version and Arktronics' own advertising called them Janewrite, Janecalc and Janelist. I'll use the latter here. Commodore also included some official marketing material with the box, hawking their new 1902 monitor (with 80 column mode, which was useless for Jane), 1571 disk drive (which works well with Jane), 1670 Modem/1200 (which Jane doesn't use), 512K REU (which Jane doesn't use either) and the 1350 mouse — which in this photo is somewhat different-appearing than the released 1350/1351, and might have been a mockup. Actually, this system would have been a very nice 128 setup and very similar to the one we'll be using both for real and in VICE. Too bad Jane 128 could use relatively little of it. Both Jane and the Perfect series were demonstrated with the 128 for Winter CES 1985, though Commodore didn't announce MSRPs then for any of them at the time. It eventually emerged later that year for $49.95 [$150]; by the next year some retailers were selling it for as low as $35 [$100], compared to each of the Perfect titles then going for $45 apiece [$130]. Plus, the Perfect titles, being CP/M-based, were bland and text-based and failed to show off the C128's graphics, so Commodore ended up emphasizing Jane more in its contemporary marketing. Booting Jane 128 from the 128DCR's internal 1571 drive with my own 1902 monitor. Although its interface is similar to the Apple II's in broad strokes, Jane 128's most obvious difference is colour. However, there are numerous more subtle UI changes in this version, sufficient for it to be called "Jane 2.0" internally before release. We'll step through them here and in the next set of screenshots because they're an interesting comparison point to modern human interface practice. As with the Apple II, across the top of the screen are the various icons, or what the manual calls "pictures." These were slightly altered for the 128 from the Apple II originals. The blue icons again set the mode of the pointer ("tools") from the hand pointer, the insertion arrow, scissors (cut), camera (copy) and paste jar. The current tool is highlighted. You select a new tool by clicking on it, but you can also use the function keys (CLR/HOME, F1, F3, F5 and F7). By modern conventions Jane's tools are used backwards: instead of selecting a text range and "choosing a tool" (e.g., Command-C for copy) to operate on it, you choose a tool first and with that tool select the text range it operates on. I'll demonstrate this specific functionality in a couple instances, but any verb-object operation in Jane will work this way. (Linguistically, this makes Jane a head-initial language, while most modern GUIs are head-final.) Next to the tools are the main apps, Janewrite (now in purple), Janecalc (in green) and Janelist (in cyan), and next to them in grey are the same standard applets built into the kernel (online help, print dialogue, disk/file manager and setup). Finally, the STOP icon, now a solid red, stops the current app, and can be used to escape some screens, though not all. Unexpectedly it doesn't serve to quit Jane entirely: you just turn the computer off. Jane remembers what app is loaded and doesn't reload the overlay if you exit and re-enter it. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel and thus matching the grey system disk. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record. Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. (Parenthetically, a frequent misconception is that the Z80 in the 128 does the boot sector check to start CP/M. In fact, the 8502 does that after the Z80 has already checked the Commodore key isn't down and entered 128 mode. In CP/M's case, the code in the CP/M disk boot sector instructs the 8502 to give control back to the Z80 so it can finish the boot sequence — if this weren't the case, the BASIC BOOT command wouldn't be able to start CP/M. Interestingly, 1581s booting CP/M have a special startup file to keep their own CP/M boot sector in a different location.) Otherwise, Jane 128 openly betrayed its origins on the 64: other than fastbooting with the 1571, which it mostly got for free, and support for the 128's new keys it took no advantage of any other 128 features, in particular no 2MHz support nor true VDC 80-column mode. Although the manual and box copy say using a mouse is supported, only the original 1350 mouse works, which strictly emulates a joystick. All three applications that were in the Apple II version are included. Under the hood the apps are implemented as overlays for a central kernel called JANEGM. Sadly, I didn't see any obvious credits while scanning through the disk files. The manual, which appears to have been written by a third party, insists on camelcasing the apps as JaneWrite, JaneCalc and JaneList even though the rear box copy doesn't distinguish them that way and the Apple II version and Arktronics' own advertising called them Janewrite, Janecalc and Janelist. I'll use the latter here. Commodore also included some official marketing material with the box, hawking their new 1902 monitor (with 80 column mode, which was useless for Jane), 1571 disk drive (which works well with Jane), 1670 Modem/1200 (which Jane doesn't use), 512K REU (which Jane doesn't use either) and the 1350 mouse — which in this photo is somewhat different-appearing than the released 1350/1351, and might have been a mockup. Actually, this system would have been a very nice 128 setup and very similar to the one we'll be using both for real and in VICE. Too bad Jane 128 could use relatively little of it. Both Jane and the Perfect series were demonstrated with the 128 for Winter CES 1985, though Commodore didn't announce MSRPs then for any of them at the time. It eventually emerged later that year for $49.95 [$150]; by the next year some retailers were selling it for as low as $35 [$100], compared to each of the Perfect titles then going for $45 apiece [$130]. Plus, the Perfect titles, being CP/M-based, were bland and text-based and failed to show off the C128's graphics, so Commodore ended up emphasizing Jane more in its contemporary marketing. Booting Jane 128 from the 128DCR's internal 1571 drive with my own 1902 monitor. Although its interface is similar to the Apple II's in broad strokes, Jane 128's most obvious difference is colour. However, there are numerous more subtle UI changes in this version, sufficient for it to be called "Jane 2.0" internally before release. We'll step through them here and in the next set of screenshots because they're an interesting comparison point to modern human interface practice. As with the Apple II, across the top of the screen are the various icons, or what the manual calls "pictures." These were slightly altered for the 128 from the Apple II originals. The blue icons again set the mode of the pointer ("tools") from the hand pointer, the insertion arrow, scissors (cut), camera (copy) and paste jar. The current tool is highlighted. You select a new tool by clicking on it, but you can also use the function keys (CLR/HOME, F1, F3, F5 and F7). By modern conventions Jane's tools are used backwards: instead of selecting a text range and "choosing a tool" (e.g., Command-C for copy) to operate on it, you choose a tool first and with that tool select the text range it operates on. I'll demonstrate this specific functionality in a couple instances, but any verb-object operation in Jane will work this way. (Linguistically, this makes Jane a head-initial language, while most modern GUIs are head-final.) Next to the tools are the main apps, Janewrite (now in purple), Janecalc (in green) and Janelist (in cyan), and next to them in grey are the same standard applets built into the kernel (online help, print dialogue, disk/file manager and setup). Finally, the STOP icon, now a solid red, stops the current app, and can be used to escape some screens, though not all. Unexpectedly it doesn't serve to quit Jane entirely: you just turn the computer off. Jane remembers what app is loaded and doesn't reload the overlay if you exit and re-enter it. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel and thus matching the grey system disk. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record. Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. The manual, which appears to have been written by a third party, insists on camelcasing the apps as JaneWrite, JaneCalc and JaneList even though the rear box copy doesn't distinguish them that way and the Apple II version and Arktronics' own advertising called them Janewrite, Janecalc and Janelist. I'll use the latter here. Commodore also included some official marketing material with the box, hawking their new 1902 monitor (with 80 column mode, which was useless for Jane), 1571 disk drive (which works well with Jane), 1670 Modem/1200 (which Jane doesn't use), 512K REU (which Jane doesn't use either) and the 1350 mouse — which in this photo is somewhat different-appearing than the released 1350/1351, and might have been a mockup. Actually, this system would have been a very nice 128 setup and very similar to the one we'll be using both for real and in VICE. Too bad Jane 128 could use relatively little of it. Both Jane and the Perfect series were demonstrated with the 128 for Winter CES 1985, though Commodore didn't announce MSRPs then for any of them at the time. It eventually emerged later that year for $49.95 [$150]; by the next year some retailers were selling it for as low as $35 [$100], compared to each of the Perfect titles then going for $45 apiece [$130]. Plus, the Perfect titles, being CP/M-based, were bland and text-based and failed to show off the C128's graphics, so Commodore ended up emphasizing Jane more in its contemporary marketing. Booting Jane 128 from the 128DCR's internal 1571 drive with my own 1902 monitor. Although its interface is similar to the Apple II's in broad strokes, Jane 128's most obvious difference is colour. However, there are numerous more subtle UI changes in this version, sufficient for it to be called "Jane 2.0" internally before release. We'll step through them here and in the next set of screenshots because they're an interesting comparison point to modern human interface practice. As with the Apple II, across the top of the screen are the various icons, or what the manual calls "pictures." These were slightly altered for the 128 from the Apple II originals. The blue icons again set the mode of the pointer ("tools") from the hand pointer, the insertion arrow, scissors (cut), camera (copy) and paste jar. The current tool is highlighted. You select a new tool by clicking on it, but you can also use the function keys (CLR/HOME, F1, F3, F5 and F7). By modern conventions Jane's tools are used backwards: instead of selecting a text range and "choosing a tool" (e.g., Command-C for copy) to operate on it, you choose a tool first and with that tool select the text range it operates on. I'll demonstrate this specific functionality in a couple instances, but any verb-object operation in Jane will work this way. (Linguistically, this makes Jane a head-initial language, while most modern GUIs are head-final.) Next to the tools are the main apps, Janewrite (now in purple), Janecalc (in green) and Janelist (in cyan), and next to them in grey are the same standard applets built into the kernel (online help, print dialogue, disk/file manager and setup). Finally, the STOP icon, now a solid red, stops the current app, and can be used to escape some screens, though not all. Unexpectedly it doesn't serve to quit Jane entirely: you just turn the computer off. Jane remembers what app is loaded and doesn't reload the overlay if you exit and re-enter it. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel and thus matching the grey system disk. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record. Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. Both Jane and the Perfect series were demonstrated with the 128 for Winter CES 1985, though Commodore didn't announce MSRPs then for any of them at the time. It eventually emerged later that year for $49.95 [$150]; by the next year some retailers were selling it for as low as $35 [$100], compared to each of the Perfect titles then going for $45 apiece [$130]. Plus, the Perfect titles, being CP/M-based, were bland and text-based and failed to show off the C128's graphics, so Commodore ended up emphasizing Jane more in its contemporary marketing. Booting Jane 128 from the 128DCR's internal 1571 drive with my own 1902 monitor. Although its interface is similar to the Apple II's in broad strokes, Jane 128's most obvious difference is colour. However, there are numerous more subtle UI changes in this version, sufficient for it to be called "Jane 2.0" internally before release. We'll step through them here and in the next set of screenshots because they're an interesting comparison point to modern human interface practice. As with the Apple II, across the top of the screen are the various icons, or what the manual calls "pictures." These were slightly altered for the 128 from the Apple II originals. The blue icons again set the mode of the pointer ("tools") from the hand pointer, the insertion arrow, scissors (cut), camera (copy) and paste jar. The current tool is highlighted. You select a new tool by clicking on it, but you can also use the function keys (CLR/HOME, F1, F3, F5 and F7). By modern conventions Jane's tools are used backwards: instead of selecting a text range and "choosing a tool" (e.g., Command-C for copy) to operate on it, you choose a tool first and with that tool select the text range it operates on. I'll demonstrate this specific functionality in a couple instances, but any verb-object operation in Jane will work this way. (Linguistically, this makes Jane a head-initial language, while most modern GUIs are head-final.) Next to the tools are the main apps, Janewrite (now in purple), Janecalc (in green) and Janelist (in cyan), and next to them in grey are the same standard applets built into the kernel (online help, print dialogue, disk/file manager and setup). Finally, the STOP icon, now a solid red, stops the current app, and can be used to escape some screens, though not all. Unexpectedly it doesn't serve to quit Jane entirely: you just turn the computer off. Jane remembers what app is loaded and doesn't reload the overlay if you exit and re-enter it. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel and thus matching the grey system disk. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record. Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent. The first section looks like this. % hexdump -C w.TESTCONV 00000000 00 88 01 00 21 00 00 00 46 00 05 00 47 00 34 03 |....!...F...G.4.| 00000010 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * 00000030 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 05 00 04 02 0a 50 01 05 |. . . . .....P..| 00000040 3d 42 01 01 6e 81 61 6e 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 |=B..n.ana abr.e.| 00000050 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 6c 84 65 00 01 6e 00 61 | al.o. al.e..n.a| 00000060 00 6e 00 61 00 20 00 61 00 62 00 72 03 65 00 20 |.n.a. .a.b.r.e. | 00000070 00 61 00 6c 02 6f 00 20 00 61 00 6c 04 65 00 20 |.a.l.o. .a.l.e. | 00000080 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * Skipping the start address (this is indeed its location in bank 1), we again see some pieces of what looks like a buffer, as well as the file length (again minus the starting address) at byte offset 14. The left margin is (probably) at byte offset 6 because the right margin is at byte offset 8 (also a 16-bit LE short), followed by the paragraph indent. After this header, we now get the text, shown here in its entirety. 000000a0 00 20 00 49 74 20 77 61 73 20 61 20 64 61 72 6b |. .It was a dark| 000000b0 20 61 6e 64 20 73 74 6f 72 6d 79 20 6e 69 67 68 | and stormy nigh| 000000c0 74 2e 00 90 49 74 90 20 90 77 61 73 90 20 90 61 |t...It. .was. .a| 000000d0 90 20 90 64 61 72 6b 90 20 90 61 6e 64 90 20 90 |. .dark. .and. .| 000000e0 75 6e 64 65 72 6c 69 6e 65 64 90 20 90 73 74 6f |underlined. .sto| 000000f0 72 6d 79 90 20 90 6e 69 67 68 74 2e 00 88 49 74 |rmy. .night...It| 00000100 88 20 88 77 61 73 88 20 88 61 88 20 88 64 61 72 |. .was. .a. .dar| 00000110 6b 88 20 88 61 6e 64 88 20 88 62 6f 6c 64 88 20 |k. .and. .bold. | 00000120 88 73 74 6f 72 6d 79 88 20 88 6e 69 67 68 74 2e |.stormy. .night.| 00000130 00 98 49 74 98 20 98 77 61 73 98 20 98 61 98 20 |..It. .was. .a. | 00000140 98 64 61 72 6b 98 20 98 61 6e 64 98 20 98 62 6f |.dark. .and. .bo| 00000150 6c 64 98 20 98 61 6e 64 98 20 98 75 6e 64 65 72 |ld. .and. .under| 00000160 6c 69 6e 65 64 98 20 98 73 74 6f 72 6d 79 98 20 |lined. .stormy. | 00000170 98 6e 69 67 68 74 2e 00 00 a0 49 74 a0 20 a0 77 |.night....It. .w| 00000180 61 73 a0 20 a0 61 6c 73 6f a0 20 a0 73 75 70 65 |as. .also. .supe| 00000190 72 73 63 72 69 70 74 65 64 a0 20 20 c0 61 6e 64 |rscripted. .and| 000001a0 c0 20 c0 73 75 62 73 63 72 69 70 74 65 64 2e c0 |. .subscripted..| 000001b0 20 20 2e 2e 2e 20 62 75 74 20 6e 6f 74 20 62 6f | ... but not bo| 000001c0 74 68 2c 00 61 6e 64 20 6e 6f 74 20 63 6f 6d 62 |th,.and not comb| 000001d0 69 6e 65 64 20 77 69 74 68 20 75 6e 64 65 72 6c |ined with underl| 000001e0 69 6e 69 6e 67 20 6f 72 20 62 6f 6c 64 2e 00 00 |ining or bold...| 000001f0 48 65 20 6c 65 66 74 20 6a 75 73 74 69 66 69 65 |He left justifie| 00000200 64 20 68 69 6d 73 65 6c 66 2e 00 ff 58 48 65 20 |d himself...XHe | 00000210 72 69 67 68 74 20 6a 75 73 74 69 66 69 65 64 20 |right justified | 00000220 68 69 6d 73 65 6c 66 2e 00 ff 24 48 65 20 70 75 |himself...$He pu| 00000230 74 20 68 69 6d 73 65 6c 66 20 72 69 67 68 74 20 |t himself right | 00000240 69 6e 20 74 68 65 20 63 65 6e 74 72 65 2e 00 ff |in the centre...| 00000250 0a 48 65 20 6d 61 64 65 20 65 76 65 72 79 74 68 |.He made everyth| 00000260 69 6e 67 20 65 78 70 61 6e 64 20 6f 75 74 2c 20 |ing expand out, | 00000270 61 20 70 61 72 61 67 72 61 70 68 20 65 78 74 65 |a paragraph exte| 00000280 6e 64 69 6e 67 20 6f 76 65 72 20 6d 75 6c 74 69 |nding over multi| 00000290 70 6c 65 00 ff 0a 6c 69 6e 65 73 2c 20 61 20 66 |ple...lines, a f| 000002a0 72 61 67 6d 65 6e 74 20 74 68 61 74 20 62 65 63 |ragment that bec| 000002b0 61 6d 65 20 61 6e 20 69 63 6f 6e 20 75 6e 74 6f |ame an icon unto| 000002c0 20 69 74 73 65 6c 66 2e 00 00 61 82 61 86 61 87 | itself...a.a.a.| 000002d0 61 82 61 81 20 61 6e 64 20 6e 65 78 74 20 41 82 |a.a. and next A.| 000002e0 41 86 41 87 41 82 41 81 20 6e 65 78 74 20 6e 82 |A.A.A.A. next n.| 000002f0 6e 86 6e 87 6e 82 6e 81 20 6e 65 78 74 20 4e 82 |n.n.n.n. next N.| 00000300 4e 86 4e 87 4e 82 4e 81 20 6d 61 81 6e 81 61 6e |N.N.N.N. ma.n.an| 00000310 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 |a abr.e. al.o. a| 00000320 6c 84 65 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |l.e.............| 00000330 00 00 00 00 00 00 |......| Most of the document again can be trivially understood as null-delimited strings. Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. As with the Apple II, across the top of the screen are the various icons, or what the manual calls "pictures." These were slightly altered for the 128 from the Apple II originals. The blue icons again set the mode of the pointer ("tools") from the hand pointer, the insertion arrow, scissors (cut), camera (copy) and paste jar. The current tool is highlighted. You select a new tool by clicking on it, but you can also use the function keys (CLR/HOME, F1, F3, F5 and F7). By modern conventions Jane's tools are used backwards: instead of selecting a text range and "choosing a tool" (e.g., Command-C for copy) to operate on it, you choose a tool first and with that tool select the text range it operates on. I'll demonstrate this specific functionality in a couple instances, but any verb-object operation in Jane will work this way. (Linguistically, this makes Jane a head-initial language, while most modern GUIs are head-final.) Next to the tools are the main apps, Janewrite (now in purple), Janecalc (in green) and Janelist (in cyan), and next to them in grey are the same standard applets built into the kernel (online help, print dialogue, disk/file manager and setup). Finally, the STOP icon, now a solid red, stops the current app, and can be used to escape some screens, though not all. Unexpectedly it doesn't serve to quit Jane entirely: you just turn the computer off. Jane remembers what app is loaded and doesn't reload the overlay if you exit and re-enter it. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel and thus matching the grey system disk. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent. The first section looks like this. % hexdump -C w.TESTCONV 00000000 00 88 01 00 21 00 00 00 46 00 05 00 47 00 34 03 |....!...F...G.4.| 00000010 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * 00000030 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 05 00 04 02 0a 50 01 05 |. . . . .....P..| 00000040 3d 42 01 01 6e 81 61 6e 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 |=B..n.ana abr.e.| 00000050 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 6c 84 65 00 01 6e 00 61 | al.o. al.e..n.a| 00000060 00 6e 00 61 00 20 00 61 00 62 00 72 03 65 00 20 |.n.a. .a.b.r.e. | 00000070 00 61 00 6c 02 6f 00 20 00 61 00 6c 04 65 00 20 |.a.l.o. .a.l.e. | 00000080 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * Skipping the start address (this is indeed its location in bank 1), we again see some pieces of what looks like a buffer, as well as the file length (again minus the starting address) at byte offset 14.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. By modern conventions Jane's tools are used backwards: instead of selecting a text range and "choosing a tool" (e.g., Command-C for copy) to operate on it, you choose a tool first and with that tool select the text range it operates on. I'll demonstrate this specific functionality in a couple instances, but any verb-object operation in Jane will work this way. (Linguistically, this makes Jane a head-initial language, while most modern GUIs are head-final.) Next to the tools are the main apps, Janewrite (now in purple), Janecalc (in green) and Janelist (in cyan), and next to them in grey are the same standard applets built into the kernel (online help, print dialogue, disk/file manager and setup). Finally, the STOP icon, now a solid red, stops the current app, and can be used to escape some screens, though not all. Unexpectedly it doesn't serve to quit Jane entirely: you just turn the computer off. Jane remembers what app is loaded and doesn't reload the overlay if you exit and re-enter it. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel and thus matching the grey system disk. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent. The first section looks like this. % hexdump -C w.TESTCONV 00000000 00 88 01 00 21 00 00 00 46 00 05 00 47 00 34 03 |....!...F...G.4.| 00000010 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * 00000030 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 05 00 04 02 0a 50 01 05 |. . . . .....P..| 00000040 3d 42 01 01 6e 81 61 6e 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 |=B..n.ana abr.e.| 00000050 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 6c 84 65 00 01 6e 00 61 | al.o. al.e..n.a| 00000060 00 6e 00 61 00 20 00 61 00 62 00 72 03 65 00 20 |.n.a. .a.b.r.e. | 00000070 00 61 00 6c 02 6f 00 20 00 61 00 6c 04 65 00 20 |.a.l.o. .a.l.e. | 00000080 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * Skipping the start address (this is indeed its location in bank 1), we again see some pieces of what looks like a buffer, as well as the file length (again minus the starting address) at byte offset 14. The left margin is (probably) at byte offset 6 because the right margin is at byte offset 8 (also a 16-bit LE short), followed by the paragraph indent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. Next to the tools are the main apps, Janewrite (now in purple), Janecalc (in green) and Janelist (in cyan), and next to them in grey are the same standard applets built into the kernel (online help, print dialogue, disk/file manager and setup). Finally, the STOP icon, now a solid red, stops the current app, and can be used to escape some screens, though not all. Unexpectedly it doesn't serve to quit Jane entirely: you just turn the computer off. Jane remembers what app is loaded and doesn't reload the overlay if you exit and re-enter it. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel and thus matching the grey system disk. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. However, unlike Jane for the Apple II, Jane 128 does not allow you to have multiple documents open simultaneously, a limitation that challenges the definition of "integrated software." In fact, of the three official Commodore productivity packages we've looked at so far, only poor abused 3-Plus-1 could do so. If you're working in one app and select another, Jane 128 will prompt you to save your work as if you'd clicked STOP, and the window will close. Given that the Apple II version managed to implement multiple documents in 64K of RAM, the Commodore 64 version — let alone the 128 — would seem to have little excuse, though I can think of two potential explanations. One is to increase the amount of memory available for any one document, which the Apple II version was indeed criticized for. The second is particular to the 128: its default memory configuration doesn't have a lot of free RAM, and it may have been judged too complicated to span or swap working sets across banks. (Some fiddling in the monitor shows that the documents simply occupy RAM in bank 1 and don't span elsewhere.) On the other hand, other 128 applications certainly do manage it, and it's possible development deadlines were a contributing factor. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel and thus matching the grey system disk. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent. The first section looks like this. % hexdump -C w.TESTCONV 00000000 00 88 01 00 21 00 00 00 46 00 05 00 47 00 34 03 |....!...F...G.4.| 00000010 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * 00000030 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 05 00 04 02 0a 50 01 05 |. . . . .....P..| 00000040 3d 42 01 01 6e 81 61 6e 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 |=B..n.ana abr.e.| 00000050 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 6c 84 65 00 01 6e 00 61 | al.o. al.e..n.a| 00000060 00 6e 00 61 00 20 00 61 00 62 00 72 03 65 00 20 |.n.a. .a.b.r.e. | 00000070 00 61 00 6c 02 6f 00 20 00 61 00 6c 04 65 00 20 |.a.l.o. .a.l.e. | 00000080 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * Skipping the start address (this is indeed its location in bank 1), we again see some pieces of what looks like a buffer, as well as the file length (again minus the starting address) at byte offset 14.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. Let's start out with the online help, one of Marks and Kotick's fundamental design goals. Assuming you got the joystick (or 1350) plugged into the right port, there's a big honking question mark. What happens when you click on it? You get right into the online help window. The pointer snaps to the options; you can also move the pointer from option or cell to another option or cell with the CRSR keys/128 arrow keys and select it with the Commodore key. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel and thus matching the grey system disk. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent. The first section looks like this. % hexdump -C w.TESTCONV 00000000 00 88 01 00 21 00 00 00 46 00 05 00 47 00 34 03 |....!...F...G.4.| 00000010 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * 00000030 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 05 00 04 02 0a 50 01 05 |. . . . .....P..| 00000040 3d 42 01 01 6e 81 61 6e 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 |=B..n.ana abr.e.| 00000050 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 6c 84 65 00 01 6e 00 61 | al.o. al.e..n.a| 00000060 00 6e 00 61 00 20 00 61 00 62 00 72 03 65 00 20 |.n.a. .a.b.r.e. | 00000070 00 61 00 6c 02 6f 00 20 00 61 00 6c 04 65 00 20 |.a.l.o. .a.l.e. | 00000080 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * Skipping the start address (this is indeed its location in bank 1), we again see some pieces of what looks like a buffer, as well as the file length (again minus the starting address) at byte offset 14.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. The window's yellow border is salient: any window that gives you choices to select from carries a yellow border. We'll see this again later. Incidentally, the manual is not in colour (just black, white and an accent magenta), and possibly as a result is all but totally ignorant of these UI choices or why they were made. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel and thus matching the grey system disk. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record. Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. The Apple II version's windows have a corner close gadget in the typical open square style, but this would only have made visual sense to someone familiar with the Lisa or Mac — which most Commodore users in 1985 wouldn't be. Instead, here windows you can close have a big bright red EXIT button (the ESC key can also serve this role in most cases). All icons are simply drawn onto the VIC-II high-res screen; unlike Magic Desk where pretty much everything was a sprite, the only sprite here is the pointer. Windows cannot be moved or resized, but by limiting icon and window boundaries to VIC-II 8x8 cells, drawing is fairly fast. Of course, most of the topics are on the yellow help disk (see? it matches). Jane 128, like the Apple II version, supports two disk drives, so you could have the help disk in device 9 and it would find it. The online help is pretty good, considering. It shows the icons and images as they would appear on-screen, and while they aren't live, they are accurate. The only black eye it gets is the technically truthful but functionally insufficient prompt "Press a key to continue" — the joystick or 1350 mouse button also work, and so does the ESC key to exit early, even though the exit button isn't shown. Some help items are animated and show you a demonstration, and each app has its own bespoke help. The system keeps track of what disks are where. If we start Janewrite by going to the typewriter, this blue dialogue box will appear — informational dialogue boxes always have a blue border — as it loads the overlay ... ... but then looks for a data disk, fails to find it, and asks for one. You need one even for a new document, and you can get stuck in a loop here if you don't provide one (pressing ESC just makes it try again, and clicking on the STOP icon doesn't do anything). You could put in the black data disk it comes with, but this one contains our generous donor's files, so we'll just give a blank disk image to VICE instead which Jane will offer to format. When creating a new data disk in VICE, if a 1571 is detected then Jane will want a real .d71 with the full available space, not a .d64, as it will then expect it can format both sides of the virtual disk. However, all of the Jane original disks, including the black one, are formatted single-sided for the 1541 since many early 128 owners would still be using one. The other way you can do this is from the disk icon. As these icons are in grey, so are their windows (except, curiously, help, but I can see how a yellow question mark would have looked bad against a white background), suggesting a global applet served by the central Jane kernel and thus matching the grey system disk. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team. C1541 is free software, covered by the GNU General Public License, and you are welcome to change it and/or distribute copies of it under certain conditions. c1541 #8> dir 0 "data#000 " 01 2a 39 "c.TESTCALC" prg 3 "l.TESTLIST" prg 4 "w.nOTE.2" prg 4 "w.TESTCONV" prg 1278 blocks free. c1541 #8> read "w.TESTCONV" ERR = 62, FILE NOT FOUND, 00, 00 cannot read `w.TESTCONV' on unit 8 invalid filename As you may have guessed, that's because the filenames, and it turns out the data in the files themselves, are stored as true ASCII, not PETSCII (indeed as they would have been on the Apple II, also), so c1541's filename conversion fails. Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record. Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent. The first section looks like this. % hexdump -C w.TESTCONV 00000000 00 88 01 00 21 00 00 00 46 00 05 00 47 00 34 03 |....!...F...G.4.| 00000010 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * 00000030 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 05 00 04 02 0a 50 01 05 |. . . . .....P..| 00000040 3d 42 01 01 6e 81 61 6e 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 |=B..n.ana abr.e.| 00000050 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 6c 84 65 00 01 6e 00 61 | al.o. al.e..n.a| 00000060 00 6e 00 61 00 20 00 61 00 62 00 72 03 65 00 20 |.n.a. .a.b.r.e. | 00000070 00 61 00 6c 02 6f 00 20 00 61 00 6c 04 65 00 20 |.a.l.o. .a.l.e. | 00000080 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * Skipping the start address (this is indeed its location in bank 1), we again see some pieces of what looks like a buffer, as well as the file length (again minus the starting address) at byte offset 14.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. The disk icon brings up a basic file manager allowing you to make duplicate backup files (but only to the same disk), rename or delete them, or create a new disk. The copy option is the default and is pre-selected when the window opens, which is irritating, because our modern reflexive habit of selecting the file first and then the action will cause an immediate copy to occur before you get the chance to click anything else. I don't think this was just me: there were several spurious duplicate files on the original black data disk I suspect for the same reason. If files are present on the disk, they will appear with their names and a filetype letter (W, C or L for Janewrite, Janecalc or Janelist respectively). Notice the slightly misshapen scrolling arrows, which were nice and clean on the Apple. We'll provide the .d71 to Jane here. Windows warning you about data loss have a red border. Interestingly, it provides both a No button and the exit button, which both do the same thing: abort back to the file manager. Jane seems unable to distinguish between an unformatted disk and a completely absent one, and will (fruitlessly) attempt to format an empty drive. Formatting in progress. The time estimates are surprisingly not far off. With our disk formatted, let's return to Janewrite at the end, since this will be the majority of the documents we'll convert. Instead, we'll start with the spreadsheet, Janecalc. Whenever any of the three built-in applications starts up, and once Jane has located the data disk, a file selector (in grey) appears. There are no spreadsheets ("worksheets") on our freshly formatted disk, so we click the NEW icon. Entering the new filename (blue window). You may have noticed that the red and blue windows are all invariably the same size regardless of contents and any active controls they contain. This probably simplified rendering quite a bit. Because Janecalc is green, its content window border is likewise green, and because Jane 128 doesn't multitask between the applications, it takes up the entirety of the screen. Two templates are provided, along with a roll-your-own option. We'll go with the Home Budget for illustration. The Home Budget template pulls up a simplified home budget by month which you can fill in. Jane supports 40, 64 and 80 column modes, all rendered in software on the VIC-IIe 320x200 display (not with the VDC's 640x200 display), but by default it uses 40. (I'll get to this in more detail in the word processor.) Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated.

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. Along the bottom are various operators and the extent of the formula functions available (hardly competition for the Convergent WorkSlate). They can be selected with the pointer in lieu of text entry, which makes them quite discoverable, but in practice it's simply faster to type them. No other functions are implemented. Since the content window cannot be resized, the maximize gadget from the Apple II version became obviously useless and was removed. By using the joystick/mouse you can use the hand to point to a cell and then, with the hand pointing to it, just start typing text or a number. The cursor keys will move the pointer from cell to cell for you, though they will not exit the content area. If you click or otherwise select the cell with the hand, however, Jane considers this an attempt to construct a formula, which again would be frustrating to modern audiences used to, say, Microsoft Excel. But to edit it again, you pick the insert tool instead of the hand, and this time you must select the cell to type in it. Motion around the content area in all three applications is accomplished using multiple small icons in the bottom and right window borders. The "half full" icon pushes it all the way to the outer edge in that direction, while the double and single arrows move the viewport by large leaps and small leaps respectively. There are no thumbs to show relative location, but you can click anywhere along the scroll area for a proportionately "medium" jump if you like. You can also use CTRL-CRSR/CTRL-arrow keys. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record. Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. Even in 40-column mode, and even given that the scroll doesn't animate and just snaps to the new position, scrolling is agonizingly slow and multiple clicks on the scroll controls invariably overshoot. Putting it in 80 column mode doesn't just give you more on the screen — it also means you don't need to endure as many pauses trying to move around. Again, I'll have more to say about font sizes when we get to Janewrite. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent. The first section looks like this. % hexdump -C w.TESTCONV 00000000 00 88 01 00 21 00 00 00 46 00 05 00 47 00 34 03 |....!...F...G.4.| 00000010 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * 00000030 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 05 00 04 02 0a 50 01 05 |. . . . .....P..| 00000040 3d 42 01 01 6e 81 61 6e 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 |=B..n.ana abr.e.| 00000050 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 6c 84 65 00 01 6e 00 61 | al.o. al.e..n.a| 00000060 00 6e 00 61 00 20 00 61 00 62 00 72 03 65 00 20 |.n.a. .a.b.r.e. | 00000070 00 61 00 6c 02 6f 00 20 00 61 00 6c 04 65 00 20 |.a.l.o. .a.l.e. | 00000080 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * Skipping the start address (this is indeed its location in bank 1), we again see some pieces of what looks like a buffer, as well as the file length (again minus the starting address) at byte offset 14. The left margin is (probably) at byte offset 6 because the right margin is at byte offset 8 (also a 16-bit LE short), followed by the paragraph indent. After this header, we now get the text, shown here in its entirety. 000000a0 00 20 00 49 74 20 77 61 73 20 61 20 64 61 72 6b |. .It was a dark| 000000b0 20 61 6e 64 20 73 74 6f 72 6d 79 20 6e 69 67 68 | and stormy nigh| 000000c0 74 2e 00 90 49 74 90 20 90 77 61 73 90 20 90 61 |t...It. .was. .a| 000000d0 90 20 90 64 61 72 6b 90 20 90 61 6e 64 90 20 90 |. .dark. .and. .| 000000e0 75 6e 64 65 72 6c 69 6e 65 64 90 20 90 73 74 6f |underlined. .sto| 000000f0 72 6d 79 90 20 90 6e 69 67 68 74 2e 00 88 49 74 |rmy. .night...It| 00000100 88 20 88 77 61 73 88 20 88 61 88 20 88 64 61 72 |. .was. .a. .dar| 00000110 6b 88 20 88 61 6e 64 88 20 88 62 6f 6c 64 88 20 |k. .and. .bold. | 00000120 88 73 74 6f 72 6d 79 88 20 88 6e 69 67 68 74 2e |.stormy. .night.| 00000130 00 98 49 74 98 20 98 77 61 73 98 20 98 61 98 20 |..It. .was. .a. | 00000140 98 64 61 72 6b 98 20 98 61 6e 64 98 20 98 62 6f |.dark. .and. .bo| 00000150 6c 64 98 20 98 61 6e 64 98 20 98 75 6e 64 65 72 |ld. .and. .under| 00000160 6c 69 6e 65 64 98 20 98 73 74 6f 72 6d 79 98 20 |lined. .stormy. | 00000170 98 6e 69 67 68 74 2e 00 00 a0 49 74 a0 20 a0 77 |.night....It. .w| 00000180 61 73 a0 20 a0 61 6c 73 6f a0 20 a0 73 75 70 65 |as. .also. .supe| 00000190 72 73 63 72 69 70 74 65 64 a0 20 20 c0 61 6e 64 |rscripted. .and| 000001a0 c0 20 c0 73 75 62 73 63 72 69 70 74 65 64 2e c0 |. .subscripted..| 000001b0 20 20 2e 2e 2e 20 62 75 74 20 6e 6f 74 20 62 6f | ... but not bo| 000001c0 74 68 2c 00 61 6e 64 20 6e 6f 74 20 63 6f 6d 62 |th,.and not comb| 000001d0 69 6e 65 64 20 77 69 74 68 20 75 6e 64 65 72 6c |ined with underl| 000001e0 69 6e 69 6e 67 20 6f 72 20 62 6f 6c 64 2e 00 00 |ining or bold...| 000001f0 48 65 20 6c 65 66 74 20 6a 75 73 74 69 66 69 65 |He left justifie| 00000200 64 20 68 69 6d 73 65 6c 66 2e 00 ff 58 48 65 20 |d himself...XHe | 00000210 72 69 67 68 74 20 6a 75 73 74 69 66 69 65 64 20 |right justified | 00000220 68 69 6d 73 65 6c 66 2e 00 ff 24 48 65 20 70 75 |himself...$He pu| 00000230 74 20 68 69 6d 73 65 6c 66 20 72 69 67 68 74 20 |t himself right | 00000240 69 6e 20 74 68 65 20 63 65 6e 74 72 65 2e 00 ff |in the centre...| 00000250 0a 48 65 20 6d 61 64 65 20 65 76 65 72 79 74 68 |.He made everyth| 00000260 69 6e 67 20 65 78 70 61 6e 64 20 6f 75 74 2c 20 |ing expand out, | 00000270 61 20 70 61 72 61 67 72 61 70 68 20 65 78 74 65 |a paragraph exte| 00000280 6e 64 69 6e 67 20 6f 76 65 72 20 6d 75 6c 74 69 |nding over multi| 00000290 70 6c 65 00 ff 0a 6c 69 6e 65 73 2c 20 61 20 66 |ple...lines, a f| 000002a0 72 61 67 6d 65 6e 74 20 74 68 61 74 20 62 65 63 |ragment that bec| 000002b0 61 6d 65 20 61 6e 20 69 63 6f 6e 20 75 6e 74 6f |ame an icon unto| 000002c0 20 69 74 73 65 6c 66 2e 00 00 61 82 61 86 61 87 | itself...a.a.a.| 000002d0 61 82 61 81 20 61 6e 64 20 6e 65 78 74 20 41 82 |a.a. and next A.| 000002e0 41 86 41 87 41 82 41 81 20 6e 65 78 74 20 6e 82 |A.A.A.A. next n.| 000002f0 6e 86 6e 87 6e 82 6e 81 20 6e 65 78 74 20 4e 82 |n.n.n.n. next N.| 00000300 4e 86 4e 87 4e 82 4e 81 20 6d 61 81 6e 81 61 6e |N.N.N.N. ma.n.an| 00000310 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 |a abr.e. al.o. a| 00000320 6c 84 65 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |l.e.............| 00000330 00 00 00 00 00 00 |......| Most of the document again can be trivially understood as null-delimited strings. Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. Unique to Janecalc, the scrolling actually wraps. Worksheets remain limited to 26 columns (A-Z), as in the Apple II version, but now up to 50 rows are allowed. Still, this wouldn't have been sufficient for anything larger than a modest small business, even in 1985. Formulas are approximately VisiCalc-style using A1 absolute notation for cells, though there are no sigils for functions (not that there's very many) and ranges are delimited by colons. Most basic math operators and parentheses are available. Here, we'll get a sum of this row ... ... and then manually calculate an average by dividing the sum by the count of populated rows (we could also just use avg). The template includes this at the bottom, but this shows you how formula entry worked. As we add data to dependent cells the sheets recalculate but circular references are not handled, though in fairness this capability was still not common in small spreadsheet applications. We'll go to Janelist next. When we do so, a red window pops up to prompt us to save our work. Switching to Janelist. Creating our new list. All very consistent (the file manager and requester seem to be part of the Jane kernel). Janelist, in fairness, never purported to be a database in any incarnation and acts more like a cardfile; even the manual merely refers to it as a "list keeper." Like Janecalc it comes with templates, though Janelist supports a substantial number more. For variety I'll try to enter some of my very large CD collection, because I'm one of those people (vinyl is for art, CD is for listening). The list comes up as fillable fields. There may be up to 15 field names up to 12 characters long. If you choose to create your own, then Jane will step you through entering the field names. That's about all the customization you can do. The values for those fields can span multiple lines, which is what the viewport scrolling is for — you use the icons at the bottom to advance through individual cards. Incidentally, Atom Heart Mother is Pink Floyd's finest album and I will tolerate no disagreement. The icon that looks like cards being pulled out suggests how to make a query (the magnifying glass icon, or possibly the funnel icon to denote a filter, wasn't universal at this point). Because it gives you choices, it's yellow, remember? The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. The two OK buttons do different things. The top one filters cards to the query requested, but the bottom one undoes any query. You can query on top of queries for a primitive sort of logical-AND. Partial word searches are supported. For example, here is the second best Beatles album — the best is, of course, Abbey Road. Since we searched for the Beatles, when we run out of Beatles CDs, nothing more turns up from my formidable library. It is also possible to sort cards, in which case they appear in that order instead. You cannot sort on multiple fields, and you can't sort descending. Finally, Janewrite, where we will spend the rest of our time — and where apparently most of Jane's users spent theirs, including our previous owners. I've got a prefab file here I constructed while playing around to explore the file format, so this time we'll load a document instead of entering one, just to show you what that looks like from the file requester. Janewrite is IMHO the most polished and competent of the three apps, and it feels like the most development time was spent on it, too. It also shows what the Jane font renderer is capable of: although non-proportional and only a single typeface, you can see bold, underline, bold and underlined, superscript, and subscript are all possible. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. The bottom shows left, right, centre and full justification options, done per line, plus the font options, and then search (this time with a magnifying glass) and page layout. These icons are larger and more detailed than the Apple's. As with other parts of the UI, text attributes are set verb-initial, i.e., you would choose the desired style, then the insertion tool, then highlight the range of text and finally release the button (or, annoyingly, wait, which makes fine adjustments harder than they should be). Notice that there is an explicit bold-and-underline option, instead of using the separate bold and underline options in combination: that's because you can't make superscripted or subscripted text bold or underlined. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record. Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. The top of the content area shows the ruler — in characters, not inches — and margin stops and the single paragraph indent stop, which you can drag to change them. Interestingly, the ruler seems to be new for Jane 128: no screenshot for the Apple II version demonstrates one. Janewrite is also capable of a modicum of WYSIWYG if you select the 80 column option. This and other options come from the "computer" icon, which acts as a preference panel. Preferences are saved to the application disk and are global to all three applications. Despite this presenting a choice window (ordinarily yellow), Jane seems to treat it as a global window from the kernel, so it's grey. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record. Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. The bottom set of options are specifically for configuring the printer. Print output is generated with control codes and text only; Jane does not generate graphic sequences, so what actually shows up on the page depends on what your printer actually supports. The default middle print size option corresponds to 80 columns (more accurately, the default or 12cpi font size), while the small font corresponds to the condensed 15cpi and/or 132 column option available on some printers, and the large font corresponds to the 60 or 64-column (e.g., 10cpi) option also only available on some printers — not the expanded double wide printing option more typical of Commodore-specific devices. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. You could also select between regular fanfold tractor feed or plain paper, as well as the Near Letter Quality print option some printers supported, and finally the printer itself. There was built-in support for the MPS-801 (i.e., 1525), MPS-802 (i.e., 1526), 1101, "Oki" (generic Okidata), and generic "Epson" printers, assuming they were connected somehow to the IEC serial such as through a third-party parallel printer interface. These printer drivers varied wildly in their capabilities: the 1525/MPS-801 "driver" supported almost nothing except basic text, while the generic Okidata and Epson drivers supported nearly everything that Jane could generate. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. The "OTHER" driver is customizeable, a neat idea, if a little clumsy. A BASIC program called BUILDPRT on the grey disk allows you to populate it with your printer's control codes. Control sequences up to three characters long were supported. You would enter these from the manual, it would save them to disk, and then you could use the custom driver inside Jane. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. The topmost options affect the appearance of Jane. You can choose from three font sizes, all non-proportional, corresponding to 40, 64 or 80 column text. Confusingly, the 80-column option is the last when it's the middle option for printing. (The Apple II version likely didn't support 80 column text due to its smaller hi-res horizontal width.) Pointer speed and the "beep" Jane makes when you select options are also configurable. Here's how it looks in 80 columns, using the typical "soft 80" approach on the 64 which is more or less legible, at least on a composite display. As there are no colours in the content area, there is no risk of colour clash. This is probably the most useful view in Janewrite. The 64-column view, by contrast, is probably the least useful. The 40-column view is the most legible and 2:1 the size of a typical 80-column line, so it's easy to mentally grok page layout that way, but the 64-column view is odd enough to end up being the worst of both worlds. An interesting feature of Janewrite are the accented characters, which was not frequently seen on home computer-class word processors, as explained by the on-line help. Janewrite treats them as diacritics, and they can even be applied to letters that wouldn't ordinarily use them (because who knows? some language might), such as the grave and acute accents on the n as well as the more typical tilde. In fact, you can apply them to any character, even punctuation. However, the use of the up arrow to indicate a circumflex means there's no way you can type a literal caret into your document, and while a macron would have been nice, omitting the umlaut seems a greater fault. The decorators are also rather hard to distinguish in 80 columns, so Spanish users of Juana 128 might want to go to cuarenta column mode to mirar mejor. Janewrite also has basic find and/or find-and-replace, and a small pane appears below the content area when it's active. There are also decent page layout options, including setting both a per-page title and its position, adding a page number and its position, and margins, number of copies and starting page, though the last two would seem more appropriate for a print dialogue than a page layout one. Note that Jane will always print a 10-space left margin, so an 80-column printed line can be no longer than 70 characters, and this is indeed the maximum width Janewrite will support. However, paragraphs are apparently not stored as continuous sequences of text, demonstrated here with a contrived example. (In fact, we'll prove they aren't shortly.) While Janewrite will word-wrap at the right margin, inserting text after that will wrap onto a new line, not into the next line, even if the two lines were previously entered "together." There's a speed/flexibility tradeoff here in that Janewrite doesn't have to continuously reflow paragraphs, but it also means its concept of a paragraph is entirely based on how much you select. The text can be manually reflowed, joining lines if necessary, by picking one of the paragraph justification options and selecting the text with the hand, which will then be reflowed (and, if needed, spaces inserted) to match. In fact, this is also necessary if you change the margins because Jane doesn't automatically reformat your document then either. I also promised you an example of cut and paste, so here's one using the scissors (cut). You simply pick it and, with the button down, drag it across the text you want and release the button. Note that there is no undo, though I suppose you could just immediately paste it back in. Exiting Janewrite (though not saving, because we need the accented characters to stay in the file). Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it. This got a little more difficult than it should have been: % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. Now that we understand what Jane can do and how it works, let's move on to converting the files. We can extract our test files we made from our .d71 with VICE's c1541 utility and hexdump it.

Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record. Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. % c1541 work.d71 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated.

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them.

Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. As you may have guessed, that's because the filenames, and it turns out the data in the files themselves, are stored as true ASCII, not PETSCII (indeed as they would have been on the Apple II, also), so c1541's filename conversion fails. Fortunately, the extract command will walk the entire directory and pull out all the files no matter what they're named. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record. Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent. The first section looks like this. % hexdump -C w.TESTCONV 00000000 00 88 01 00 21 00 00 00 46 00 05 00 47 00 34 03 |....!...F...G.4.| 00000010 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * 00000030 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 05 00 04 02 0a 50 01 05 |. . . . .....P..| 00000040 3d 42 01 01 6e 81 61 6e 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 |=B..n.ana abr.e.| 00000050 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 6c 84 65 00 01 6e 00 61 | al.o. al.e..n.a| 00000060 00 6e 00 61 00 20 00 61 00 62 00 72 03 65 00 20 |.n.a. .a.b.r.e. | 00000070 00 61 00 6c 02 6f 00 20 00 61 00 6c 04 65 00 20 |.a.l.o. .a.l.e. | 00000080 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * Skipping the start address (this is indeed its location in bank 1), we again see some pieces of what looks like a buffer, as well as the file length (again minus the starting address) at byte offset 14.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. The documents are all regular Commodore PRoGram files with a starting address and they appear to be loaded in-place at that address into bank 1. This introduces the possibility of some delightful save-file hacks but we're not here for that today. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well. I imaged their disk using my ZoomFloppy and external 1571, and since they are normal PRGs, a BAM copy of the allocated sectors is all we need to do, with one wrinkle: % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. That means we can also simply extract our previous owners' files en masse as well.

Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record. Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent. The first section looks like this. % hexdump -C w.TESTCONV 00000000 00 88 01 00 21 00 00 00 46 00 05 00 47 00 34 03 |....!...F...G.4.| 00000010 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * 00000030 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 05 00 04 02 0a 50 01 05 |. . . . .....P..| 00000040 3d 42 01 01 6e 81 61 6e 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 |=B..n.ana abr.e.| 00000050 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 6c 84 65 00 01 6e 00 61 | al.o. al.e..n.a| 00000060 00 6e 00 61 00 20 00 61 00 62 00 72 03 65 00 20 |.n.a. .a.b.r.e. | 00000070 00 61 00 6c 02 6f 00 20 00 61 00 6c 04 65 00 20 |.a.l.o. .a.l.e. | 00000080 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * Skipping the start address (this is indeed its location in bank 1), we again see some pieces of what looks like a buffer, as well as the file length (again minus the starting address) at byte offset 14.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ?

'{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. % d64copy -B 9 r_jane_bam.d64 [Warning] growing image file to 683 blocks 14: --*****--*****--***** 8% 15/171[Warning] read error: 0e/00: 5 14: ?******************** 12% 21/171[Warning] giving up... 14: ?******************** 15: ********************* 16: ********************* 17: ********************* 18: ******************* 19: ******************* 20: ******************* 21: ******************* 22: ****..***...***...* 100% 171/171 170 blocks copied. % c1541 r_jane_bam.d64 c1541 (VICE 3.8) Copyright 1995-2023 The VICE Development Team.

Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated.

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. Fortunately it doesn't look like the bad sector was in any of the files they cared about. Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated.

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. Let's get an idea of the format from our test files. Janecalc files are "huge" because it looks like the entire 26x50 cell range is saved regardless of whether anything's in it or not. Looking at the directory of their data disk where they had saved a couple of sparse test spreadsheets of their own, they also were 39 blocks in length no matter how many cells were actually populated. The on-disk format is consequentially a bit wasteful: 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings).

Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. 000003a0 00 00 00 00 00 20 20 20 4a 61 6e 75 61 72 79 20 |.....

The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record. Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. Cardfiles are stored much more efficiently. Here's the entirety of our two cards. The fields are in the header, padded out to the fixed 12 character length, but with technically unnecessary nulls between them. A spurious "Beatles" entry looks like a buffer that was captured as part of the save, and there is also a page-aligned (counting the starting address) pad of nulls. Otherwise, the value strings look null-delimited, in the order they appear in the field list (unpopulated fields are zero-length strings). When you run out of fields, you're on the next card. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record.

We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. % hexdump -C l.TESTLIST 00000000 00 7f 01 00 36 02 08 00 04 00 54 69 74 6c 65 20 |....6.....Title | 00000010 20 20 20 20 20 20 00 4c 65 61 64 20 41 72 74 69 | .Lead Arti| 00000020 73 74 20 00 4f 74 68 65 72 20 41 72 74 69 73 74 |st .Other Artist| 00000030 00 43 6f 6d 70 6f 73 65 72 20 20 20 20 00 43 6f |.Composer .Co| 00000040 6e 64 75 63 74 6f 72 20 20 20 00 57 68 65 72 65 |nductor .Where| 00000050 20 4b 65 70 74 20 20 00 42 6f 72 72 6f 77 65 64 | Kept .Borrowed| 00000060 20 62 79 20 00 44 61 74 65 20 4c 65 6e 74 20 20 | by .Date Lent | 00000070 20 00 00 00 ff ff 01 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff | ...............| 00000080 ff ff ff ff ff 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 00 01 02 |................| 00000090 03 04 05 06 07 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff 00 |................| 000000a0 00 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 00 00 |.The Beatles....| 000000b0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| * 00000100 d7 09 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf a5 ea a9 d7 15 |...``...........| 00000110 80 ac 1d 21 d6 1c 80 60 60 ac 98 09 ae 04 cf 20 |...!...``...... | 00000120 75 0b 00 00 ac 0a 95 a5 f0 b0 a9 a6 b1 a9 a4 b1 |u...............| 00000130 a5 f1 b0 a9 a7 b1 a9 a5 b1 ac c0 08 cf 20 75 0b |............. u.| 00000140 fe ff a5 37 ae 8c ff 00 c0 d8 4b 80 cf a5 f0 b0 |...7......K.....| 00000150 a7 a6 b1 c0 d8 60 80 a5 f1 b0 a7 a7 b1 c0 d8 60 |.....`.........`| 00000160 80 cf a5 f0 b0 a7 a6 b1 00 00 09 00 01 5d f6 00 |.............]..| 00000170 00 00 00 09 00 09 00 01 66 f6 00 00 00 00 54 00 |........f.....T.| 00000180 50 00 01 b1 f6 69 64 65 20 12 00 42 00 01 6f f6 |P....ide ..B..o.| 00000190 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| 000001a0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 52 65 76 6f 6c 76 65 72 00 |.......Revolver.| 000001b0 54 68 65 20 42 65 61 74 6c 65 73 00 00 4c 65 6e |The Beatles..Len| 000001c0 6e 6f 6e 2d 4d 63 43 61 72 74 6e 65 79 2d 48 61 |non-McCartney-Ha| 000001d0 72 72 69 73 6f 6e 00 47 65 6f 72 67 65 20 4d 61 |rrison.George Ma| 000001e0 72 74 69 6e 00 00 00 00 00 41 74 6f 6d 20 48 65 |rtin.....Atom He| 000001f0 61 72 74 20 4d 6f 74 68 65 72 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 |art Mother.Pink | 00000200 46 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 57 61 74 65 72 73 2d 47 69 |Floyd..Waters-Gi| 00000210 6c 6d 6f 75 72 2d 4d 61 73 6f 6e 2d 57 72 69 67 |lmour-Mason-Wrig| 00000220 68 74 2d 47 65 65 73 6f 6e 00 50 69 6e 6b 20 46 |ht-Geeson.Pink F| 00000230 6c 6f 79 64 00 00 00 00 |loyd....| 00000238 This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. This would be very easy to convert, and I just manually did this by dumping everything with strings for their one cardlist with one single record. Other things I can pick out are the file length minus the starting address at byte offset 4 (as a little-endian unsigned 16-bit quantity), and the value at byte offset 6 might be the number of fields, though we don't need either of those to simply grab the data. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent. The first section looks like this. % hexdump -C w.TESTCONV 00000000 00 88 01 00 21 00 00 00 46 00 05 00 47 00 34 03 |....!...F...G.4.| 00000010 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * 00000030 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 05 00 04 02 0a 50 01 05 |. . . . .....P..| 00000040 3d 42 01 01 6e 81 61 6e 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 |=B..n.ana abr.e.| 00000050 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 6c 84 65 00 01 6e 00 61 | al.o. al.e..n.a| 00000060 00 6e 00 61 00 20 00 61 00 62 00 72 03 65 00 20 |.n.a. .a.b.r.e. | 00000070 00 61 00 6c 02 6f 00 20 00 61 00 6c 04 65 00 20 |.a.l.o. .a.l.e. | 00000080 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * Skipping the start address (this is indeed its location in bank 1), we again see some pieces of what looks like a buffer, as well as the file length (again minus the starting address) at byte offset 14.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. Now for the Janewrite files, starting with our test document which should contain every sort of text ornamentation that Janewrite can represent.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. % hexdump -C w.TESTCONV 00000000 00 88 01 00 21 00 00 00 46 00 05 00 47 00 34 03 |....!...F...G.4.| 00000010 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * 00000030 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 05 00 04 02 0a 50 01 05 |. . . . .....P..| 00000040 3d 42 01 01 6e 81 61 6e 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 |=B..n.ana abr.e.| 00000050 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 6c 84 65 00 01 6e 00 61 | al.o. al.e..n.a| 00000060 00 6e 00 61 00 20 00 61 00 62 00 72 03 65 00 20 |.n.a. .a.b.r.e. | 00000070 00 61 00 6c 02 6f 00 20 00 61 00 6c 04 65 00 20 |.a.l.o. .a.l.e. | 00000080 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 00 20 |. . . . . . . . | * Skipping the start address (this is indeed its location in bank 1), we again see some pieces of what looks like a buffer, as well as the file length (again minus the starting address) at byte offset 14.

Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. Skipping the start address (this is indeed its location in bank 1), we again see some pieces of what looks like a buffer, as well as the file length (again minus the starting address) at byte offset 14. The left margin is (probably) at byte offset 6 because the right margin is at byte offset 8 (also a 16-bit LE short), followed by the paragraph indent. After this header, we now get the text, shown here in its entirety. 000000a0 00 20 00 49 74 20 77 61 73 20 61 20 64 61 72 6b |. .It was a dark| 000000b0 20 61 6e 64 20 73 74 6f 72 6d 79 20 6e 69 67 68 | and stormy nigh| 000000c0 74 2e 00 90 49 74 90 20 90 77 61 73 90 20 90 61 |t...It. .was. .a| 000000d0 90 20 90 64 61 72 6b 90 20 90 61 6e 64 90 20 90 |. .dark. .and. .| 000000e0 75 6e 64 65 72 6c 69 6e 65 64 90 20 90 73 74 6f |underlined. .sto| 000000f0 72 6d 79 90 20 90 6e 69 67 68 74 2e 00 88 49 74 |rmy. .night...It| 00000100 88 20 88 77 61 73 88 20 88 61 88 20 88 64 61 72 |. .was. .a. .dar| 00000110 6b 88 20 88 61 6e 64 88 20 88 62 6f 6c 64 88 20 |k. .and. .bold. | 00000120 88 73 74 6f 72 6d 79 88 20 88 6e 69 67 68 74 2e |.stormy. .night.| 00000130 00 98 49 74 98 20 98 77 61 73 98 20 98 61 98 20 |..It. .was. .a. | 00000140 98 64 61 72 6b 98 20 98 61 6e 64 98 20 98 62 6f |.dark. .and. .bo| 00000150 6c 64 98 20 98 61 6e 64 98 20 98 75 6e 64 65 72 |ld. .and. .under| 00000160 6c 69 6e 65 64 98 20 98 73 74 6f 72 6d 79 98 20 |lined. .stormy. | 00000170 98 6e 69 67 68 74 2e 00 00 a0 49 74 a0 20 a0 77 |.night....It. .w| 00000180 61 73 a0 20 a0 61 6c 73 6f a0 20 a0 73 75 70 65 |as. .also. .supe| 00000190 72 73 63 72 69 70 74 65 64 a0 20 20 c0 61 6e 64 |rscripted. .and| 000001a0 c0 20 c0 73 75 62 73 63 72 69 70 74 65 64 2e c0 |. .subscripted..| 000001b0 20 20 2e 2e 2e 20 62 75 74 20 6e 6f 74 20 62 6f | ... but not bo| 000001c0 74 68 2c 00 61 6e 64 20 6e 6f 74 20 63 6f 6d 62 |th,.and not comb| 000001d0 69 6e 65 64 20 77 69 74 68 20 75 6e 64 65 72 6c |ined with underl| 000001e0 69 6e 69 6e 67 20 6f 72 20 62 6f 6c 64 2e 00 00 |ining or bold...| 000001f0 48 65 20 6c 65 66 74 20 6a 75 73 74 69 66 69 65 |He left justifie| 00000200 64 20 68 69 6d 73 65 6c 66 2e 00 ff 58 48 65 20 |d himself...XHe | 00000210 72 69 67 68 74 20 6a 75 73 74 69 66 69 65 64 20 |right justified | 00000220 68 69 6d 73 65 6c 66 2e 00 ff 24 48 65 20 70 75 |himself...$He pu| 00000230 74 20 68 69 6d 73 65 6c 66 20 72 69 67 68 74 20 |t himself right | 00000240 69 6e 20 74 68 65 20 63 65 6e 74 72 65 2e 00 ff |in the centre...| 00000250 0a 48 65 20 6d 61 64 65 20 65 76 65 72 79 74 68 |.He made everyth| 00000260 69 6e 67 20 65 78 70 61 6e 64 20 6f 75 74 2c 20 |ing expand out, | 00000270 61 20 70 61 72 61 67 72 61 70 68 20 65 78 74 65 |a paragraph exte| 00000280 6e 64 69 6e 67 20 6f 76 65 72 20 6d 75 6c 74 69 |nding over multi| 00000290 70 6c 65 00 ff 0a 6c 69 6e 65 73 2c 20 61 20 66 |ple...lines, a f| 000002a0 72 61 67 6d 65 6e 74 20 74 68 61 74 20 62 65 63 |ragment that bec| 000002b0 61 6d 65 20 61 6e 20 69 63 6f 6e 20 75 6e 74 6f |ame an icon unto| 000002c0 20 69 74 73 65 6c 66 2e 00 00 61 82 61 86 61 87 | itself...a.a.a.| 000002d0 61 82 61 81 20 61 6e 64 20 6e 65 78 74 20 41 82 |a.a. and next A.| 000002e0 41 86 41 87 41 82 41 81 20 6e 65 78 74 20 6e 82 |A.A.A.A. next n.| 000002f0 6e 86 6e 87 6e 82 6e 81 20 6e 65 78 74 20 4e 82 |n.n.n.n. next N.| 00000300 4e 86 4e 87 4e 82 4e 81 20 6d 61 81 6e 81 61 6e |N.N.N.N. ma.n.an| 00000310 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 |a abr.e. al.o. a| 00000320 6c 84 65 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |l.e.............| 00000330 00 00 00 00 00 00 |......| Most of the document again can be trivially understood as null-delimited strings. Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. 000000a0 00 20 00 49 74 20 77 61 73 20 61 20 64 61 72 6b |. .It was a dark| 000000b0 20 61 6e 64 20 73 74 6f 72 6d 79 20 6e 69 67 68 | and stormy nigh| 000000c0 74 2e 00 90 49 74 90 20 90 77 61 73 90 20 90 61 |t...It. .was. .a| 000000d0 90 20 90 64 61 72 6b 90 20 90 61 6e 64 90 20 90 |. .dark. .and. .| 000000e0 75 6e 64 65 72 6c 69 6e 65 64 90 20 90 73 74 6f |underlined. .sto| 000000f0 72 6d 79 90 20 90 6e 69 67 68 74 2e 00 88 49 74 |rmy. .night...It| 00000100 88 20 88 77 61 73 88 20 88 61 88 20 88 64 61 72 |. .was. .a. .dar| 00000110 6b 88 20 88 61 6e 64 88 20 88 62 6f 6c 64 88 20 |k. .and. .bold. | 00000120 88 73 74 6f 72 6d 79 88 20 88 6e 69 67 68 74 2e |.stormy. .night.| 00000130 00 98 49 74 98 20 98 77 61 73 98 20 98 61 98 20 |..It. .was. .a. | 00000140 98 64 61 72 6b 98 20 98 61 6e 64 98 20 98 62 6f |.dark. .and. .bo| 00000150 6c 64 98 20 98 61 6e 64 98 20 98 75 6e 64 65 72 |ld. .and. .under| 00000160 6c 69 6e 65 64 98 20 98 73 74 6f 72 6d 79 98 20 |lined. .stormy. | 00000170 98 6e 69 67 68 74 2e 00 00 a0 49 74 a0 20 a0 77 |.night....It. .w| 00000180 61 73 a0 20 a0 61 6c 73 6f a0 20 a0 73 75 70 65 |as. .also. .supe| 00000190 72 73 63 72 69 70 74 65 64 a0 20 20 c0 61 6e 64 |rscripted. .and| 000001a0 c0 20 c0 73 75 62 73 63 72 69 70 74 65 64 2e c0 |. .subscripted..| 000001b0 20 20 2e 2e 2e 20 62 75 74 20 6e 6f 74 20 62 6f | ... but not bo| 000001c0 74 68 2c 00 61 6e 64 20 6e 6f 74 20 63 6f 6d 62 |th,.and not comb| 000001d0 69 6e 65 64 20 77 69 74 68 20 75 6e 64 65 72 6c |ined with underl| 000001e0 69 6e 69 6e 67 20 6f 72 20 62 6f 6c 64 2e 00 00 |ining or bold...| 000001f0 48 65 20 6c 65 66 74 20 6a 75 73 74 69 66 69 65 |He left justifie| 00000200 64 20 68 69 6d 73 65 6c 66 2e 00 ff 58 48 65 20 |d himself...XHe | 00000210 72 69 67 68 74 20 6a 75 73 74 69 66 69 65 64 20 |right justified | 00000220 68 69 6d 73 65 6c 66 2e 00 ff 24 48 65 20 70 75 |himself...$He pu| 00000230 74 20 68 69 6d 73 65 6c 66 20 72 69 67 68 74 20 |t himself right | 00000240 69 6e 20 74 68 65 20 63 65 6e 74 72 65 2e 00 ff |in the centre...| 00000250 0a 48 65 20 6d 61 64 65 20 65 76 65 72 79 74 68 |.He made everyth| 00000260 69 6e 67 20 65 78 70 61 6e 64 20 6f 75 74 2c 20 |ing expand out, | 00000270 61 20 70 61 72 61 67 72 61 70 68 20 65 78 74 65 |a paragraph exte| 00000280 6e 64 69 6e 67 20 6f 76 65 72 20 6d 75 6c 74 69 |nding over multi| 00000290 70 6c 65 00 ff 0a 6c 69 6e 65 73 2c 20 61 20 66 |ple...lines, a f| 000002a0 72 61 67 6d 65 6e 74 20 74 68 61 74 20 62 65 63 |ragment that bec| 000002b0 61 6d 65 20 61 6e 20 69 63 6f 6e 20 75 6e 74 6f |ame an icon unto| 000002c0 20 69 74 73 65 6c 66 2e 00 00 61 82 61 86 61 87 | itself...a.a.a.| 000002d0 61 82 61 81 20 61 6e 64 20 6e 65 78 74 20 41 82 |a.a. and next A.| 000002e0 41 86 41 87 41 82 41 81 20 6e 65 78 74 20 6e 82 |A.A.A.A. next n.| 000002f0 6e 86 6e 87 6e 82 6e 81 20 6e 65 78 74 20 4e 82 |n.n.n.n. next N.| 00000300 4e 86 4e 87 4e 82 4e 81 20 6d 61 81 6e 81 61 6e |N.N.N.N. ma.n.an| 00000310 61 20 61 62 72 83 65 83 20 61 6c 82 6f 82 20 61 |a abr.e. al.o. a| 00000320 6c 84 65 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |l.e.............| 00000330 00 00 00 00 00 00 |......| Most of the document again can be trivially understood as null-delimited strings. Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. Most of the document again can be trivially understood as null-delimited strings. Notice that no single line ever exceeds 80 columns in length: as we demonstrated above, there are no Dana paragraphs, only Zuul lines. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting.

For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. There are also various meta-sequences for the formatting. We can pick out the easy ones right away: $90 turns on and off underlining (interesting that Jane automatically skips spaces, much as would be the convention on a typewriter), $88 bold, $98 bold and underlined, $a0 superscript and $c0 subscript. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent.

Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that.

With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete.

Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. For justification, we can infer that a line starting with $ff indicates different formatting for that line. A superficial guess would suppose the next character sets the justification type, e.g. $58 right, $24 centre, and $0a full justification (left justification is the default and implied). However, looking at some of the family's files, there were other values here, many of which were close to those numbers but many that were also rather disparate, and none that exceeded $8c (140). Eventually it became clear that all it indicates is the number of leading spaces divided by two, or more generally stated, all levels of justification are simply baked into the document and pre-calculated with spaces. This is entirely consistent with the lack of automatic reflow we saw while in Janewrite. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway. An experiment I did showed that this is true for multiple characters as well, as long as they're all the same diacritic. So far so good, but the strange part is alternating between multiple accented characters back to back with different accents. Our letter sequences are unaccented, circumflex, grave, acute and tilde, yet the metacharacters seem to change between the $82s, after which we drop down to $81 following the final character which sounds like the delimiter itself changed too. This is the same pattern for each of the other multibyte clusters in this example. I did a test document with "ãâáàa" (i.e., ascending metacharacters $81 $82 $83 $84) and got $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61 $87 $61 $84 $61, while "àáâãa" (descending $84 $83 $82 $81) is rendered $84 $61 $87 $61 $81 $61 $83 $61 $81 $61, "áàãâa" (i.e., $83 $84 $81 $82) is rendered $83 $61 $87 $61 $85 $61 $83 $61 $82 $61, and "àâáãa" (i.e., $84 $82 $83 $81) comes out $84 $61 $86 $61 $81 $61 $82 $61 $81 $61. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. Accents are also a little odd. If we take the last four words with single accents, then the ornamented letter would seem surrounded by the metacharacter: $81 $63 $81 for ñ (CTRL-@), $82 $6f $82 for ô (^), $83 $65 $83 for é (CTRL-;) and $84 $65 ($84) for è (CTRL-*), though since it occurs at the end of the line it would be cancelled anyway.

The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. A couple of Pibb Xtras later, I finally realized what it was doing: it's exclusive-ORing the low nybble of adjacent metacharacters together so that it recognizes them as continuations (or, if the sequence is over, zero). Because of the specific values used, they won't generate any other valid metacharacter. To encode $81 $82 $83 $84, 1 is XORed with 2 and the high bit restored to yield $83, 2 is XORed with 3 to yield $81, 3 is XORed with 4 to yield $87 and then $84 is the expected terminal delimiter. To decode the resulting $81 $83 $81 $87 $84, $81 is used as the initial delimiter, then 1 is XORed with 3 to yield $82, then this is used as the next low nybble XORed with 1 to yield $83, then 3 is XORed with 7 to yield $84, and then 4 XOR 4 is 0, ending the sequence. This is a little complex to model and I didn't need it to convert the family files, so I went with this small Perl script which converted them to RTF, preserving boldface, underline, superscripting and subscripting, and the leading indent. It was also an excuse to learn how to write RTF documents from scratch, though please don't consider its output to be particularly good RTF. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ? '{\super ' : '}'); }; if ($_ == 192) { $sub ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sub) ? '{\sub ' : '}'); }; # XXX: accented characters not yet implemented } print STDOUT '\b0' if ($bold || $bunder); print STDOUT '\ul0' if ($under || $bunder); print STDOUT '}' if ($sub || $sup); # shouldn't be nested print STDOUT "\\par$crlf"; } print STDOUT "}$crlf"; I relentlessly tested the output against TextEdit, NeoOffice, LibreOffice and Microsoft Word on the Mac, and Word on my office PC, and concluded there was no good way to make them all happy. Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well.

RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. #!/usr/bin/perl eval 'use bytes'; $crlf = "\015\012"; # magic read from either ARGV or STDIN, set ARGV filehandle # splitting it up into bytes was to analyze the header $/ = \163; @header = map { ord } split(//, <>); # get header die("abnormally short\n") if (scalar(@header) != 163); $/ = "\00"; # lines are null-separated print STDOUT "{\\rtf1\\ansi{\\fonttbl\\f0\\fmodern\\fprq1 Courier;}\\f0\\fs20\\pard${crlf}"; while(<ARGV>) { chop; # not chomp $bold = 0; $under = 0; $bunder = 0; $sup = 0; $sub = 0; # load indent if (s/^\xff([\x00-\xff])//) { $_ = " " x (ord($1)/2) . $_; } # force NBSP because Word thinks it's smarter than we are s/ /\\u160;/g; unless (/[\x80-\xff]/) { print STDOUT "$_\\par$crlf"; next; } foreach (map { ord } split(//, $_)) { unless ($_ & 128) { print STDOUT chr($_); next; } if ($_ == 136) { $bold ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\b$bold "; next; } if ($_ == 144) { $under ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$under "; next; } if ($_ == 152) { $bunder ^= 1; print STDOUT "\\ul$bunder\\b$bunder "; next; } # XXX: sup/sub looks fine in Mac Text Edit, wrong in Word # because it shrinks the font as well if ($_ == 160) { $sup ^= 1; print STDOUT (($sup) ?

Since Janewrite is strictly non-proportional and character-oriented, the resulting document has to be monospace and spaces must be fixed-width to preserve the original formatting. TextEdit was the most flexible about this, accepted nearly anything, and rendered it as expected. Word, however, thought it was smarter than my carefully crafted output and changed the width of spaces even with an explicitly monospace font such that things failed to line up. The solution was to make it use a non-blocking space, which TextEdit also serenely accepts (though it wanted an explicit delimiter, not just a space character), but which shows up as a block character in NeoOffice and LibreOffice. I gave up at that point and declared it good enough. Change the above if you disagree. Maybe I should have done this in HTML because everything renders HTML the same, right? (Right??) A residual problem is that superscript and subscript in Word, NeoOffice and LibreOffice also reduce the font size, which is not consistent with Jane and also messes up alignment, and there didn't seem to be a way to manually specify the vertical baseline in RTF but keep the same font size to get around that. Once again, only TextEdit's output properly resembles Janewrite's. This is another exercise left for the reader since I didn't need that to convert their documents either. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later.

It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market. That probably speaks well of its interface and its suitability to basic tasks. Jane was never available on any other systems and Commodore never released any updates, but Arktronics did work on at least one other port for Commodore: the original Textcraft for the Amiga 1000 in 1985. This seems to have been the last product Arktronics was involved in, after which it went under as the new 16-bit systems made its flagship software package obsolete. That same year five employees, including at least two of the original Apple II programmers, sued Arktronics and Marks and Kotick personally (Mantei v. Arktronics) over their now worthless shares, saying they had been misled. In 1989, after protracted litigation, Kotick was ordered to honour the settlement of $17,000 [$44,500 in 2025 dollars] and again in 1998, by then increasing to $49,226 with interest [$96,500]. (In 2022, one of the plaintiffs, John Wiersba, said he was still never paid, an assertion which Kotick's spokesman disputed.) But this was all likely a mere distraction to Marks and particularly Kotick, who in 1987 turned around to make an audacious if unsuccessful attempt to buy Commodore, believing the Amiga could lead a comeback in computer gaming after the 1983 video game crash. Commodore managed to rebuff him and in 1991 Kotick, Marks and their partners executed a hostile takeover of another target instead for just $440,000 [about $1.15 million], an ailing software company called Mediagenic. Mediagenic had a long prior history in video games, but believed the field was unlikely to rebound, and was in the midst of an unsuccessful effort to broaden into productivity software. Kotick, who had just left that market segment, disagreed and reconstituted the company back into its prior business and under its former name: Activision. In the process Kotick didn't forget his previous benefactor and Steve Wynn ended up with a million and a half shares in the new company, which became so successful in its revitalized form that in 2012 Wynn commented in amazement to the New York Times that "[t]he kid [Kotick] was telling me I had $31 million I didn't know about." Despite Activision's stratospheric rebirth, Kotick's leadership became nearly as controversial as it was profitable. Although Marks entered as the new Activision's chairman, by the late 1990s his relationship with his college friend had frayed over what Marks called Kotick's willingness to battle over even trivial sums of money, and he left the company in 1997. After a new business software venture called eMinds failed, in 2004 Marks bought out the trademark of the defunct Acclaim Entertainment to form a new Acclaim Games focusing on the MMO market, which he sold in 2010 and flamed out just months later. Marks subsequently co-founded equity crowdfunding platform StartEngine, where he remains the CEO. Meanwhile, Kotick steered Activision through its 2008 $18.9 billion merger with Vivendi Games and its Blizzard subsidiary, becoming Activision Blizzard and for a time the largest video games publisher in the world, its 2013 split back out from Vivendi, lawsuits over toxic workplace allegations, and Microsoft's 2022 buyout for $68.7 billion under which Kotick left the company at the end of 2023. It isn't clear who retains the rights and IP to Jane today, though at least for the Apple II version they likely remain split between Marks and Kotick personally and possibly Wynn, while Cloanto and Vantiva retain joint rights to the Commodore 128 and Thomson MO5 versions. As for Sig Hartmann, arguably the father of Commodore's software division, he passed away in 2014. With our task complete, let's finish the story of Jane. The Atari 8-bit and IBM PC ports likewise never materialized, but Jane was ultimately ported to one more — and, outside its home country of France, rather obscure — system: the 1985 Thomson MO5, manufactured by French electronics company Thomson SA (now Vantiva SA), which had recently been nationalized out of Thomson-Brandt and Thomson-CSF by French president François Mitterand in 1982. The Thomson home computers were all based on a 1MHz Motorola 6809E CPU with various custom video chips and produced from 1982 to around 1989. They broadly divide into the more upmarket TO-class and the entry-level MO-class machines, ostensibly compatible within lines, though I'll demonstrate that this is not always the case. The MO5 was the second of these systems, an enhanced version of the original TO7 with 48K of RAM and an improved colour palette, developed as terminals ("nanomachines") for the French government's Plan Informatique pour Tous ("Computing for All") to introduce computers to French pupils and support domestic industry. It was sold against, and intended to compete directly with, the ZX Spectrum — particularly as initially sold with a Chiclet-style keyboard — and the Commodore 64. These screenshots were taken with the DCMOTO emulator. Not counting the unreleased Commodore 64 version, Jane for the MO5 is the only version of Jane that actually does come as a cartridge-floppy combination, and thus requires the optional CD 90-351 or CQ 90-028 floppy disk interface (only tape is supported by the base unit). Although the cartridge is a whopping 64K in size, MO5 Jane is still a three-disk system (i.e., apps, help and data). The cartridge appears to contain the MO5 Jane kernel and low-level drivers. Similar to Commodore and Jane 128, MO5 Jane was explicitly Thomson-badged and sold. When turned on with the cartridge installed, it immediately prompts (with a blue window) for the application floppy. The main screen. Like the TO7 before it, the MO5 comes with a light pen which Jane uses as its primary pointing device, and this is the only Jane port that officially uses one. It's not clear who (Thomson or Arktronics or a third party) did this port and I don't have a copy of the manual. However, I also strongly believe Howard Marks was personally involved with its development given his country of origin. Jane 128 and MO5 Jane are obviously related to each other, quite clearly more than either is related to the original Apple II version, and as such I'm not exactly sure which one came first — though my suspicion is still Jane 128, since it almost certainly built on already existing work for the 64, and would have been a higher corporate priority due to Commodore's larger install base. Indeed, MO5 Jane uses much the same colour scheme, icons and basic interface as Jane 128, though the STOP (not ARRET?) icon is oddly rendered in orange instead of red and there's no black anywhere despite the EFGJ03L video chip having both colours in its palette. With a single drive there ends up being a lot of disk swapping. A lot of disk swapping. The NEW icon and EXIT button are now NEUF and SORTIR, but the rest of the basic interface (modulo palette) is much the same, even the same lumpy file requester arrows. The online help remains available in bright flaring yellow and as good as it ever was, but that constant floppy cha-cha will dampen your interest to use it. The MO5 does not have hardware sprites, so the pointer is drawn by software and demonstrates that familiar Speccy-style colour clash. Probably because of the limited RAM, all three applications are simplified compared to the Apple and Commodore versions, in some cases drastically. Like Jane 128, there is no multitasking and windows are fixed, but there are other cuts. For example, here in Janewrite, there are no superscripts or subscripts, though accents are kept — it's French, after all — and it even supports umlauts and cedillas. This is done with the MO5's ACCENT key, which you press, release, and then press the desired key (such as ACCENT, E for ë, ACCENT, 6 for é and ACCENT, 9 for ç). Janelist now only supports two templates (plus create your own). Fortunately I can still keep my record collection in it. On the other hand, Janecalc is now just a basic spreadsheet — no templates at all — and the spreadsheet is even more limited to A-O (i.e., just 15 columns) and 25 rows. But probably the biggest limitation in MO5 Jane is that everything is 40 columns, even though the graphics hardware and 320x200 display are absolutely capable of the same "soft 80" display Jane 128 generates. For crying out loud, even the Apple II version had a 64-column option. It really makes you wonder what on earth that 64K of ROM in the cartridge is actually doing. I should mention as a postscript that MO5 Jane is quite finicky about the hardware configuration. Even with the lightly-modified MO5E export model some prompts get garbled, and on the network-enabled MO5 NR (or, presumably, an MO5 with the network upgrade installed) the cartridge is recognized but the machine immediately crashes when selected. It also won't run on the later MO6 and it was never ported to any other Thomson system. Run it only on the original. Although it's arguable which of the two is more powerful — the Apple II version is more flexible and more integrated, but the Commodore 128 version has a stronger interface, larger workspace and 80-column output — Jane 128 got similar reviews to Jane on the Apple II and some of the same criticism as well. RUN in March 1987 again approved of the interface, but complained about the sluggish performance — both on-screen and on-paper — and that the 80-column software output was hard to read compared to the VDC's native 80-column output, which the reviewer called "[t]he program's greatest flaw." The review also noted that printing a spreadsheet had to be stopped manually or it would merrily waste paper on empty cells until the entire sheet had been iterated over. Still, reviewer John Premack said it was "a must for beginners of all ages" and gave it a "B" grade overall. I don't think Commodore was expecting much from Jane, and it ably occupied the low-end niche that Goheen and Smith wanted it to, so perhaps that was enough. It certainly seems to have been for my Australian 128DCR's previous owners, because the entire family used it (even some brief school papers from their kid) and some documents are dated well into 1990, long after Jane — and for that matter the 128 itself — was off the market.

Good read as always. I didn't have any fancy software like Jane, I used (a pirated copy of) Bank Street Writer. I used Bank Street Writer on the Apple IIe in school, and we did have a (legal :-D ) copy for the Commodore 64, but I rapidly outgrew it. It did its job teaching me how to use one, though, so I remember it fondly. Comments are subject to moderation. Be nice. Comments are subject to moderation. Be nice.

Title: Report: Apple has held internal discussions about acquiring Perplexity
URL: https://siliconangle.com/2025/06/20/report-apple-held-internal-discussions-acquiring-perplexity/
Time Published: 2025-06-20T23:42:00Z
Full Content:
UPDATED 19:42 EDT / JUNE 20 2025 by Maria Deutscher Apple Inc. executives have held discussions about buying Perplexity AI Inc., Bloomberg reported today. The publication cited sources as saying that the talks are in an early stage and may not lead to an acquisition. Perplexity reportedly received a $14 billion valuation in a recent funding round. To be accepted, any takeout offer made by Apple would likely have to be higher. San Francisco-based Perplexity operates a consumer-focused search engine powered by artificial intelligence models. Rather than returning a list of webpages in response to queries, the service generates a natural language response. It can also visualize stock price changes, analyze user-uploaded files and perform other tasks. Perplexity had more than 15 million monthly users last April, a number that has likely increased significantly since then. The company recently disclosed that it processed 780 million user requests in May. Moreover, the volume of queries that it receives is growing by 20% every month. Perplexity generates revenue by offering two paid editions of its search engine. The first, Perplexity Pro, gives users access to reasoning models from providers such as OpenAI. There’s also an Enterprise Pro plan geared towards large organizations. Perplexity’s other revenue source is its Sonar suite of application programming interfaces for developers. Using the APIs, software teams can embed the core features of the company’s search engine into their custom applications. Adrian Perica, Apple’s vice president of corporate development, has reportedly discussed the idea of buying Perplexity with a number of other executives. It’s believed the search provider wasn’t involved in the talks. However, Apple representatives did meet with Perplexity executives multiple times recently to discuss its technology. Today’s report follows an unsuccessful attempt by Meta Platforms Inc. to acquire Perplexity. According to Bloomberg, the Facebook parent walked away from the deal over disagreements about financial terms. Meta later made a $14.3 billion investment in Scale AI Inc., a startup that supplies training datasets for AI development projects. It’s believed that Apple could eventually decide to partner with Perplexity instead of buying it. Such an arrangement would likely cost significantly less. Additionally, it would have a lower chance of drawing scrutiny from antitrust regulators. The acquisition discussions come against the backdrop of a high-profile antitrust trial over Google LLC’s search business. Currently, the Alphabet unit pays Apple billions of dollars annually to keep its search engine the default option on iOS. The lawsuit could potentially require the companies to end the payments. If that happens, Apple may be more inclined to partner with Google competitors such as Perplexity. Perplexity is not the only AI startup that has drawn takeover interest. According to CNBC, Meta recently tried to buy Safe Superintelligence Inc., a company co-founded by former OpenAI Chief Scientist Ilya Sutskever. After the offer was rebuffed, the Facebook parent reportedly shifted its focus to recruiting the startup’s top executives.

Catherine McGrath is a crypto fellow at Fortune. Shares of the first publicly-traded stablecoin company Circle continued to surge on Friday after the Senate passed legislation that would establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency designed to maintain a value in line with the U.S. dollar, earlier this week. Shares of Circle are up 53%, soaring from $148 to $227, since the market opened on Wednesday after the legislation passed in the Senate on Tuesday night. Shares of other crypto-related companies increased on the news with Coinbase, the leading crypto exchange in the U.S., gaining 20% since Wednesday. The legislation, known as the GENIUS act, is a first-of-its-kind bill that would establish regulations and consumer protections for stablecoin companies, including full reserve backing, monthly audits, and anti-money laundering compliance. After passing in the Senate, it will be sent to the House of Representatives for a vote and potential revisions. Circle issues USDC, the second-largest stablecoin by market cap behind Tether’s USDT. Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire expressed his support for the bill in a post on X after the Senate vote on Tuesday night. “History is being made, as the US Senate passes the GENIUS Act, taking us one step closer to breakthrough legislation being signed into law that will drive U.S. economic and national competitiveness for decades to come,” he wrote. The surge in Circle’s stock price comes weeks after the company’s debut on the stock market under the ticker CRCL. After pricing its shares at $31, CRCL opened on the New York Stock Exchange at $69. Within its first day on the market, the company’s shares soared to a high of $103.75 before closing at $82.23, showcasing strong retail demand for access to the stablecoin industry. Since 2021, stablecoins have become increasingly popular outside of the U.S. as a means to settle cross-border transfers and protect assets against inflation. Crypto firms, however, have long complained that the U.S. stablecoin industry has been hindered by a lack of clear regulations, especially under Biden-era Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) chair Gary Gensler who initiated dozens of investigations and enforcement actions against crypto companies. The Senate’s passage of the GENIUS act was aided by President Donald Trump’s vocal support of the broader crypto industry. In addition to pushing for Congress to pass the stablecoin bill, Trump has established a national Bitcoin reserve, pardoned crypto criminal Ross Ulbricht and appointed SEC officials that have ended a number of lawsuits against crypto companies. With support from the U.S. president and increasing regulatory clarity, mainstream corporations are considering implementing them into their payment structures, including Meta, Google, AirBnB and X. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

Title: S&P To Crash 50%? Trump Calls Jerome Powell “Dumbest”

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. President Donald Trump reignited his long-standing feud with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Thursday, calling him "one of the dumbest, and most destructive, people in Government [sic]". This is new territory. President Trump had mostly resisted from hurling direct insults against Fed Chair Powell in his second term. Not any more. Could this escalate into Trump firing Chair Powell over the next few months? The comment on social media followed the Fed’s decision to hold interest rates steady, with the Federal Open Market Committee maintaining its target range at 4.25% to 4.5% - unchanged since December. Trump has been calling for lower rates, noting that the Fed was costing the country billions in interest payments. Facade of the Marriner S Eccles building of the United States Federal Reserve, on a bright and sunny ... More day in Washington, DC, United States, July 24, 2017. (Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images) Trump’s rhetoric sure does make headlines, but the real danger for investors is the Fed buckling under political pressure and cutting rates too soon. That could unleash a second wave of inflation, which might be more entrenched than the post-Covid surge. If that happens, expect a sharp reset in valuations, a spike in bond yields, and a steep correction in the S&P 500. Cutting interest rates before inflation is fully tamed risks igniting a more persistent cycle of price increases, forcing the Fed to respond later with even more aggressive hikes, just as it did in the 1970s, when inflation spiraled out of control. Is 50% drop in S&P possible? Consider this. Back then, the Fed’s delayed tightening led to stagflation and a severe equity downturn: the S&P 500 fell nearly 50% between 1972 and 1974. What’s more, higher valuations today, coupled with policy uncertainty, might actually make things worse. For investors seeking upside with less volatility than individual stocks, the Trefis High Quality portfolio offers an alternative. This portfolio has outperformed the S&P 500 and delivered cumulative returns of over 91% since inception. Trump's Policies Create The Perfect Storm? This time around, there is a risk of persistent supply-side inflation driven by policy. Trump’s policy agenda, which includes 3 things [1] tariffs, [2] mass deportations, and [3] tax cuts, could create a perfect storm of sorts. First, tariffs are a supply shock. They raise input costs and consumer prices by removing cheaper imports from the market. Second, mass deportations of immigrants who entered the country illegally sounds reasonable - after all, they’re illegal immigrants - except that it will make cheaper labor unavailable. On average, the price of services will go up. This could be a big factor driving inflation higher. Third, there are the tax cuts under Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill, under which most taxpayers are expected to see a tax cut, with all income groups reportedly likely to benefit. Now, while tariffs and deportations constrain the supply of goods and services to increase prices, reduction in taxes makes more cash available to consumers. So people can spend more while prices are higher. The result would be spiking inflation, and this would make the Fed’s job a lot harder. A Replay of the 1970s? The Fed will likely pull out its 2022 playbook: it’ll have no choice but to increase interest rates - not just reverting some of the recent cuts, but in fact, going beyond, to rates above 6% and even 7% or higher for short-term treasuries. Now, if you can get a guaranteed 6% on a 1-year Treasury bill, or bank savings - risk-free investments - won’t you demand higher earnings and returns from stocks as well? There will be an exodus - a massive outflow from the S&P and overall markets from risky equities into treasuries, CDs, and savings accounts. It happened in 2022 - within months, the S&P 500 tumbled by 20%. It’s easy to forget that stocks including Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Meta (NASDAQ:META) had lost more than 50% in the 2022 rate cycle alone (Can Nvidia Stock Lose 50%?). Smaller companies, with less cash on their balance sheets, fared even worse. That said, in 2022, inflation was largely transitory, and the Fed was able to bring it under control. This time, it could be entrenched. Covid-related stimulus money was a transient cause of 2022 inflation. This time, tariffs, tax cuts, and deportations, together, are likely to prove a stronger and perhaps much more persistent force. A replaying of the 1970s crisis is very much possible, taking the S&P 500 down. Higher rates don’t just hurt stocks - they make U.S. debt less sustainable. Annual interest payments now already exceed $1 trillion, and JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has called it a red flag. If bond markets start to question the government’s fiscal path, yields could spike, deepening the equity selloff. On top of that, loan defaults are rising both in the commercial real estate sector and across consumer debt, like credit cards and auto loans. Big lenders like JPMorgan, BofA, and Citigroup are especially exposed. So, how much would that hurt? Well, the combined market cap of S&P 500 constituents is roughly $47 trillion. So a 50% decline in the index would mean a loss of more than $23 trillion in value. And you thought the $5 trillion-plus wipeout the benchmark index witnessed in the first few days of April 2025 was bad! How Low Can JPMorgan Stock Go In A Market Crash? A Question When things are bad, what do you expect Trump to do? Blame everyone else, or change his course on taxes, deportation, and tariffs? There’s certainly hope that his cabinet and loyalists will be able to sway his view into easing inflationary policies in the event they create spiking inflation before the U.S. economy plunges into a recession. But if the easing does not materialize or comes into play too late, how bad can things get if there is another recession?

InfoQ Homepage Articles Analyzing Apache Kafka Stretch Clusters: WAN Disruptions, Failure Scenarios, and DR Strategies Jun 20, 2025 31 min read by Srikanth Daggumalli Nishchai Jayanna Manjula reviewed by Steef-Jan Wiggers Apache Kafka is a well-known publish-subscribe distributed system widely used across industries for use cases such as log analytics, observability, event-driven architectures, and real-time streaming. Its distribution allows it to become the critical piece or backbone of modern streaming architecture, offering many integrations and supporting near-real-time or real-time latency requirements. Today, Kafka has been offered by major companies as a service, including Confluent Kafka as well as cloud offerings such as Confluent Cloud, AWS Managed Streaming Kafka , Google Cloud Managed Service for Apache Kafka, Azure Event Hub for Apache Kafka, etc. Additionally, Kafka has been deployed across over one-hundred-thousand companies, including Fortune 100 across various industry segments such as enterprise, financials, healthcare, automobile, startups, independent software vendors, and retail sectors. The value of the data diminishes over time. Many businesses these days compete in time and demand real-time data processing with millisecond responses to power mission-critical applications. Financial services, e-commerce, IoT, and other latency-sensitive industries require highly available and resilient architectures that can withstand infrastructure failures without impacting business continuity. Companies operating across multiple geographic locations need solutions that provide seamless failover, data consistency, and disaster recovery (DR) capabilities while minimizing operational complexity and cost. One of the common architectural patterns that companies often consider using is a single Kafka cluster spanning multiple data center locations on WAN (Wide Area Network). It is called Stretch Cluster. This pattern is commonly considered by companies for disaster recovery (DR) and high availability (HA). Stretch Cluster can theoretically provide data redundancy across regions and minimize data loss in the event of a region-wide failure. However, this approach comes with several challenges and trade-offs due to the inherent nature of Kafka and its dependency on network latency, consistency, and partition tolerance in a multi-region setup. In this article, we are going to focus on the stretch cluster architectural pattern for DR or HA-related implications and considerations. The following testing has been conducted, and the cluster behavior has been documented. Below is the high-level view of a single stretch cluster setup that spans across the London and Frankfurt regions with In this use case, we have used a producer written in Java that consistently produces defined (K) Transactions Per Second (aka TPS), which can be controlled using properties files. Sample snippets using Kafka performance test api. In this use case, we have used consumers written in Java that consistently consume defined (K) transactions per second (TPS), which can be controlled using properties files. Before diving into further discussions and scenario executions, it's crucial to understand the fundamental algorithms of distributed systems. This foundational knowledge will help you better correlate WAN disruptions with their impact on system behavior. CAP Theorem (i.e., Consistency, Availability, and Partition tolerance) applies to all the distributed systems like Kafka, Hadoop, Elasticsearch, and many others, where data is being distributed across nodes to: Consistency (C) Every read gets the latest write or an error. Availability (A) Every request gets a response, even if some nodes fail. Partition Tolerance (P) The system keeps working despite network issues. Kafka is an AP system; it prioritizes Availability and Partition Tolerance, while consistency is eventual and tunable via settings. Now, let's get into the scenarios. Before going in-depth into scenarios, let's understand the key components and terminology of Kafka internals. As discussed in earlier sections, in a distributed network setup across geographic locations, network service interruptions can occur because no service guarantees 100% availability. This scenario focuses on WAN disruption between two regions, causing Kafka service unavailability, leaving the cluster with zero active controllers and no self-recovery, even after hours of waiting. Kafka is unavailable and can't be recovered on its own upon WAN service disruption and reestablishment and shows active controllers as '0' It's a "brain-dead" scenario. Upon WAN disruption, a single 4-node cluster becomes 2 independent clusters, each with 2 nodes. WAN disruption can be done by deleting or modifying route tables. Warning: Deleting a route table may disrupt all traffic in the associated subnets. Instead, consider modifying or detaching the route table. You may need to shut down firewalls Firewall status: systemctl status firewalld Firewall stop: service firewalld stop ZK Server start: bin/zookeeper-server-start etc/kafka/zookeeper.properties ZK Server stop: zookeeper-server-stop ZK Shell commands: bin/zookeeper-shell.sh <zookeeper host>:2181 Active controllers check: get /controller or ls /controller Brokers list: /home/opc/kafka/bin/zookeeper-shell kafkabrokeraddress:2181 <<<"ls /brokers/ids" Alternative to check controllers and brokers in a cluster. Available from kafka 3.7.x bin/kafka-metadata-shell.sh --bootstrap-server <KAFKA_BROKER>:9092 --describe-cluster Kafka is not available and can't be recovered on its own upon WAN service disruption and re-establishment and shows active controllers as '2' Kafka is not available and couldn't be recovered on its own upon and showed active controllers as '0' From the logs, observed disk-related errors and exceptions Logs show that the controller moved the exception from one broker to another broker, but no exit or hang was reported in the logs Controllers '0' behavior is equal to the brain-dead scenario explained in scenario 2. Killing broker and ZK processes (an uncontrolled shutdown can be comparable with machine abrupt reboot) and restarting brokers lead to corrupted indices, rebuilding indices doesn't work even after hours of waiting. This scenario is comparable to an ungraceful shutdown during an environment upgrade or to a poor security posture, where an unauthorized person could terminate the service. Kafka is not available and couldn't be recovered on its own. From the logs, 'index corrupted' logs for partitions are shown, and also 'rebuilding indices logs'. Rebuilding indices didn't work and doesn't show any related logs on progress. The resulting cluster is in unavailable status even after 1 hour. Also, it is recommended to do graceful shutdowns instead of using the kill switch or doing abrupt shutdowns so the data in the Kafka local cache will be flushed to the disks by maintaining meta data information and also committing offsets. Deploying on-premise stretch clusters requires a deep understanding of failure scenarios, particularly during network disruptions. Unlike cloud environments, on-premises setups may lack highly available network infrastructure, fault tolerance mechanisms, or dedicated fiber lines, making them more susceptible to outages. In such cases, a Kafka cluster may experience downtime if network connectivity is disrupted. Cloud providers, on the other hand, offer high-bandwidth, low-latency networking over fully redundant, dedicated metro fiber connections between regions and data centers. Their managed Kafka services are designed for high availability, typically recommending deployment across multiple zones or regions to withstand zonal failures. Additionally, these services incorporate zone-awareness features, ensuring Kafka data replication occurs across multiple zones, rather than being confined to a single one. It is also important to understand and emphasize the latency impact on a stretch cluster deployed in two different Geo locations with a WAN connection. We can not escape physics; in our case, as per WonderNetwork, the average latency between London and Frankfurt is 14.88 milliseconds for a distance of 636km. So, for mission-critical applications, the setup of a stretch cluster driven by latencies, through testing, is needed to determine how the data is being replicated and consumed across. By understanding these differences, organizations can make informed decisions about whether an on-premise stretch cluster aligns with their availability and resilience requirements or if a cloud-native Kafka deployment is a more suitable alternative. A Business Continuity Plan (BCP) is essential for any business to maintain its brand and reputation. Almost all the companies think of High Availability (HA) and Disaster recovery (DR) strategies to meet their BCP. Below are the popular DR Strategies for Kafka. Before we dive deep into DR strategies further, let's understand that the Kafka Mirror Maker 2.0 we are using in the following architectural patterns. There are other components like Kafka Connect, Replicator, etc., offered by Confluent and other cloud services, but they are out of scope for this article. DNS Redirection in Apache Kafka is a cross-cluster replication tool that uses the Kafka Connect framework to replicate topics between clusters, supporting active-active and active-passive setups. It provides automatic consumer group synchronization, offset translation, and failover support for disaster recovery and multi-region architectures. This is a popular DR strategy pattern where there will be two different Kafka clusters, which are of identical size & configuration, deployed in two different Geo regions or Data centers. In this case, it's the London and Frankfurt regions. Usually, Geo location choice depends upon Earth's different tectonic plates, company or country compliance and regulations requirements, and other factors. Out of which only one cluster is active at a given point of time, which receives and serves the clients. As shown in the following picture, Kafka cluster one (KC1) is located in the London region and Kafka cluster two (KC2) is located in the Frankfurt region with the same size and configuration. All the producers are producing data to KC1 (London region cluster), and all consumers are consuming the data from the same cluster. KC2 (Frankfurt region cluster) receives the data from the KC1 cluster through Mirror Maker as shown in Figure 1. Figure 1: Kafka Active Standby (aka Active Passive) cluster setup with Mirror role In simple terms, we can treat the mirror maker as a combination of producer and consumer, where it consumes the topics from the source cluster KC1 (London region) and produces the data to the destination cluster KC2 (Frankfurt region). During the disaster to the primary/active cluster KC1 (London region), the standby cluster (Frankfurt region) will become active, and all the producers and consumers' traffic redirected to the standby cluster. This can be achieved through DNS redirection via a load balancer in front of Kafka clusters. Fig 2 shows this scenario. Figure 2: Kafka Active Standby setup - Standby cluster becomes active When the London Region KC1 cluster becomes active, we need to set up a mirror maker instance to consume the data from the Frankfurt region cluster and produce back to it to the London region KC1 cluster. This scenario is shown in Fig. 3. It's up to the business to keep the Frankfurt region (KC2) active or promote the London region cluster (KC1) back to primary once the data is fully synced/hydrated to the current state. In some cases, the standby cluster, i.e., the Frankfurt region cluster (KC2), continues to function like an active cluster and the London region cluster (KC1) becomes the standby as well. It is essential to note that RTO (Recovery Time Objective) and RPO (Recovery Point Objective) values are high compared to the Active-Active setup. Active-standby setup cost is medium to high as we need to maintain the same Kafka clusters in both regions. Figure 3: Kafka Active Standby setup – Standby cluster data sync happening to the KC1 Kafka Mirror Maker Replication Lag (Δ): Let's take a scenario, and it might happen very rarely, where we lose all the cluster completely, including nodes and disks, etc. Where the Active Kafka Cluster (London region - KC1) has 'm' messages, and the mirror maker is consuming and producing to the standby cluster. Due to network latency or consumers & producing process with acknowledgements, the standby cluster (i.e., Frankfurt region - KC2) lags behind and holds only 'n' messages. Which means the delta(\(\Delta\)) is m minus n. \(\Delta = m - n\) where: Due to this replication lag (\(\Delta\)), it will have the following impact on mission-critical applications Potential Message Loss: If a failover occurs before the Standby cluster catches up, some messages (\(\Delta\)) may be missing. Inconsistent Data: Consumers relying on the Standby cluster may process incomplete or outdated data. Delayed Processing: Applications depending on real-time replication may experience latency in data availability. The replication lag concern can be overcome with the Active-Active setup. Just like the Active standby setup, we will have the same Kafka clusters deployed in the London and Frankfurt regions. The producers of the ingestion pipeline will write the data to both clusters at any given point in time. Which is also known as Dual Writes. So, both clusters' data is in sync as shown in Fig. 4. Please note that the ingestion pipeline or producers should have the capability to support dual writes. It is also important to note that these write pipelines should be isolated so that any issue with one cluster should not impact other pipelines or create back pressure and producer latencies. For example, if your use case is log analytics or observability, considering Logstash in your ingestion and creating two separate pipelines within a single or more Logstash instances will act as an isolated pipeline. But only one cluster is active for the consumers at any given point of time. Figure 4: Active-Active setup or Dual writes. In case, as shown in Figure 5, any issues with the one cluster the consumers need to be redirected with DNS redirect and RTO and RPO or SLAs are near zero. Figure 5: Active-Active setup, one cluster is unavailable Once the London cluster is available and becomes active, data can sync back to the London cluster from the Frankfurt cluster using Mirror Maker. As shown in Fig. 6, consumers can be switched back to the London cluster using DNS redirect. Also, it is important to configure consumer groups to start where they left off. During this setup, during the failover, it is important to configure consumers' offset to read the messages from a particular point in time, like reply messages from the last current time minus 15 mins, or set up a mirror maker between active clusters to read 'only' consumer offset topics from the London region cluster and replicate to the Frankfurt region cluster. And during the failure, you can use source.auto.offset.reset=latest to read the data from the latest offsets in the Frankfurt region cluster. If the consumer groups are not properly configured, you may see duplicate messages in your downstream system. So, it's essential to design the downstream to handle duplicate records. For example, if it's an observability use case and if the downstream is OpenSearch, it's good practice to design a unique ID depending on the message timestamp and other parameters like session IDs, etc. So, that duplicate message will overwrite the existing duplicate record and maintain only one record. Figure 6: Active-Active setup cluster syncing data with MirrorMaker Message ordering challenges occur when writing to two clusters simultaneously, messages may arrive in different orders due to network delays between regions. This can be particularly problematic for applications that require strict message ordering. So, it needs to be handled in the data processing time or downstream systems. For example, defining a primary key within the message body timestamp field would order the messages based on timestamps. Data Consistency Issues can occur while establishing dual writes to two different clusters. It requires robust monitoring and reconciliation processes to ensure data integrity across clusters. Because there might be conditions where data might successfully write to one cluster but fail in another, resulting in data inconsistency. Producer complexity is an issue in this active-active setup. Producers need to handle writing to two clusters and manage failures independently for each cluster, so isolation of each pipeline is important. This setup might increase the complexity of the producer applications and require more resources to manage dual writes effectively. There are some agents or tools in the market also as open-source offerings that will provide dual pipeline options such as Elastic Logstash. Consumer group management is complex. Managing consumer offsets across multiple clusters could be challenging, especially during failover scenarios, and can lead to message duplication. Consumer applications or downstream systems need to be designed to handle duplicate messages or implement deduplication logic. Operational Overhead - Running active-active clusters requires sophisticated monitoring tools and increases operational costs significantly. Teams need to maintain detailed runbooks and conduct regular disaster recovery drills to ensure smooth failover processes. Network Latency Considerations- Cross-region network latency and bandwidth costs become critical factors in active-active setups. Reliable network connectivity between regions is essential for maintaining data consistency and managing replication effectively. Backup and restore is a cost-effective architectural pattern compared to Active Standby(AP) or Active Active(AA) DR architectural patterns. It is suitable for non-critical applications with higher RTO and RPO values compared to AA or AP patterns. Backup and restore is a cost-effective option because we need only one Kafka cluster. In case the Kafka cluster is unavailable, the data from the centralized repository can be replayed/restored to the Kafka cluster once it becomes available. In this architectural pattern, shown in Figure 7, all the data will be saved to a persistent location like Amazon S3 or another data lake, where the data can be restored/replayed to the Kafka cluster when the Kafka cluster is available. It is also common to see a new environment of Kafka clusters built together using terraform templates and build a new Kafka cluster and replay data. Figure 7: Backup and restore architectural pattern Recovery time impact is a major consideration; Restoring (aka replaying) large volumes of data to Kafka can take significant time, resulting in a higher RTO. This makes it suitable only for applications that can tolerate longer downtimes. Data consistency challenges are also an issue. When restoring data from backup storage like Amazon S3, maintaining the exact message ordering and partitioning as the original cluster can be challenging. Special attention is needed to ensure data consistency during restoration. Backup performance overhead is a further consideration. Regular backups to external storage can impact the performance of the production cluster. The backup process needs careful scheduling and resource management to minimize impact on production workloads. Storage is key. Managing large volumes of backup data requires effective storage lifecycle policies and controlling costs. Regular cleanup of old backups and efficient storage utilization strategies are essential. Coordination during recovery is mandatory. The recovery process requires careful coordination between backing up offset information and actual messages. Missing either can lead to message loss or duplication during restoration. As we explored earlier, choosing a DR strategy isn't one-size-fits-all, it comes with trade-offs. It often boils down to finding the right balance between what the business needs and what it can afford. The decision usually depends on several factors. SLAs (e.g., 99.99%+ uptime) are pre-defined commitments to uptime and availability. An SLA requiring 99.99% uptime allows only 52.56 minutes of downtime per year. The RTO metric is used to define the maximum acceptable downtime for a system or application after a failure before it causes unacceptable business harm. Knowledge/content/training systems, for example, can expect one hour or more downtime because they are not mission critical. For banking applications, on the other hand, downtime acceptance could be none or a couple of minutes. The RPO metric is used to define the maximum acceptable amount of data loss during a disruptive event, measured in time from the most recent backup. For example, an observability/monitoring application can have the acceptability for losing the past hour whereas a financial application can not tolerate losing a single record of transaction data. Associated costs vary. Higher availability and faster recovery typically come at a higher price. Organizations must weigh their need for uptime and data protection against the financial investment required. References: A round-up of last week’s content on InfoQ sent out every Tuesday.

Title: The 2025 Forbes World’s Most Influential CMOs List

BySeth Matlins, Forbes Staff. Not ha-ha funny but rather the hard-to-define, hard-to-precisely-quantify, kind of funny, like how the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is funny. In our world, which is to say the world of business globally and marketing specifically, influence often hides-in-plain-sight, and can be confused with visibility, or a type of popularity measured by follower counts, “likes”, or the stuff of performative thought leadership. And while these can provide and be platform for the exercise of influence, in and of themselves, they’re not proof of it. They’re optics, and as the unreliable testimony of an eye-witness proves, optics can distort. The most influential CMOs are not necessarily those posting or speaking on panels most often. Theirs often isn’t the loudest voice in the room, because sometimes like that not done that not said speaks volumes. As we at Forbes consider the evolving nature, impact, and measurement of influence, we offer that nothing is as influential as impact. We are certain that the ultimate measure of influence is not about the spotlight but a CMO’s commercial impact on the business and brands they help steward, and the marketing community globally. We are certain the most effective exercise of a CMO’s influence lies in their ability to change the attitudes and behaviors of others—the “consumers” and “customers” they court externally and, as surely, their C-suite colleagues and teams internally. We know that not every job brilliantly done necessarily gets recognition, and that the measure and impact of a CMO’s influence amongst their global peers—the kind that moves markets, companies, culture, and behaviors in service of commercial returns—doesn’t always announce itself. Which is why, in partnership with Sprinklr and with supplemental data provided by LinkedIn, we take a broad, multifaceted, rigorous, and data-led approach to our evaluation. Beginning with an eligible universe of over 1500 CMOs from industries around the world, using 20 proxies for it, and through an analysis of 10 billion data points (up from 9 billion YoY), we concern ourselves with what can be seen, understood, and evaluated. (For more detail on the methodology—including our 20+ indicators of influence, the data sources and scoring frameworks—see Sprinklr’s companion report here.) Of course, like the job of the CMO itself, the nature of influence itself continues evolving. As marketing authority becomes ever more decentralized, distributed, and democratized, so too does CMO influence. That which once flowed top-down, is now networked, lateral, circular, ambient. The tools of marketing influence are now in everyone’s hands, sentient and not. Brand-building and, sometimes brand-tearing-down, has become a shared exercise among stakeholders inside and outside any given company—across the C-suite, business units, customer support, comms, operations, employee advocacy, and every keyboard with or without a corporate login. All of this and the shifting sands of consumer sentiment, tech acceleration, geopolitical unrest, economic uncertainty, the absence of understanding of what marketing truly is and does from CEOs and CFOs without experience in the practice, cultural fragmentation and 1000 other things, makes the effective deployment of a CMO’s influence more complex than ever. It also makes the achievement of being recognized on a list measuring it even more meaningful. The 50 chief marketers on the 2025 Forbes World’s Most Influential CMOs list, along with the six 2025 Forbes CMO Hall of Fame inductees, are shaping the companies they serve, the character and destiny of industry, and in ways that might not yet be recognizable, the world itself. They are influencing others through word, work, actions, inactions, culture, peers, platforms, partnerships, and impacts—not hierarchy. They aren’t just influencing what a brand says but shaping how a company thinks, what it does, and when, why, and how often others buy. They aren’t just steering creative—they’re stewarding growth. They’re leading from the center, even if their titles—and/or CEOs and Boards—don’t always put them there. Individually and collectively, their influence and impact deserve our appreciation, and their examples our consideration. The Forbes CMO Hall of Fame The 2025 Forbes CMO Hall of Fame inductees represent the fourth class since the Hall’s inaugural one in 2022. Created to recognize those chief marketers who, in 2022, had or in all subsequent years, would have, appeared on our World’s Most Influential CMOs list five times. Given the massive changes to the landscape in which these CMOs compete and operate, being recognized on this Forbes list five times is an extraordinary achievement and testimony to their talents and contributions. Entering 2025, ten chief marketers had been recognized on the list four times previously and were thus eligible for induction. Of these ten, it is our privilege to induct six into the Forbes CMO Hall of Fame Class of 2025. These six join the 20 chief marketers inducted previously, each and all of whom are recognized for the enduring influence and impact they’ve had on the brands and businesses they’ve led, on our industry, commerce, and, often, on the cultural landscape itself. Read more about this year’s Forbes CMO Hall of Fame inductees, as well as those from prior years, here. The Forbes World’s Most Influential CMOs List: 2025 Marian Lee CMO of one of the world’s most culturally influential brands, and the largest entertainment company by market cap, Lee’s work has global visibility and influence. The breadth of her remit includes full responsibility across the streamer’s global and local campaigns, experiential activations, social storytelling, and brand partnerships in support of Netflix’s scaling advertising business. With a nearly $2 billion annual advertising budget, Lee’s work plays a pivotal role in shaping how and where Netflix shows up for the audiences of its TV series, films, reality competitions, sports, and gaming efforts. No longer just a content platform, Netflix has become a brand with massive influence over how people’s time, attention and conversation is focused. Over the past year, Lee and her team launched massive integrated campaigns for the NFL including “The Beyonce Bowl,” returning mega-franchises like “Squid Game” and multi-national favorites including “Bad Influence.” Lee’s conviction that one size does not fit all and that “fans don’t just want to watch a show, they want to live it,” drives a strategy designed to blur the boundary between viewer and participant; as a result, Netflix’s marketing events, from immersive fan experiences to location takeovers, including their tentpole Tudum fan-festival, have become cultural moments in their own right. Her fan-first, culture-forward approach is helping drive not just tune-in but momentum across Netflix’s advertising business, which now has 94 million monthly active users, an increase of 20 million since just November. Lee is only the third CMO to be recognized as number one on this list in consecutive years. As of June 6th, the company’s stock was up over 93% year-over-year (YoY). New Balance Davis’s influence is shaping more than a brand but also a category in flux. Responsible for New Balance’s brand strategy, product and demand creation initiatives around the globe, Davis is driving the company’s cultural relevance and commercial returns by elevating the brand’s appeal and affinity through global creative, unexpected partnerships, and consumer-focused commercial strategies. The privately held company’s brand ascension and approach have become a case study across the broader marketing community, as Davis has positioned New Balance as a global challenger brand—one equally credible on the runway, in the locker room, and on the street. Davis’s marketing framework prioritizes long-term cultural resonance over short-term hype: In the past year, the brand expanded its global footprint with talent and storytelling that span both performance and lifestyle. A mix of collaborations both short and long-term—from Shohei Ohtani to Loro Piana, Miu Miu, Coco Gauff, Bayer Leverkusen, and number one NBA draft choice Cooper Flagg—demonstrate a values-based approach to partners and the diverse audiences they reach while reinforcing New Balance’s selective distribution strategy, all of which serve to elevate brand perception globally. In FY2024, New Balance reported a record $7.8 billion in revenue, marking its fourth consecutive year of 20%+ growth. Asmita Dubey Dubey leads brand strategy, digital innovation and consumer engagement globally for the world’s largest beauty company and its portfolio of brands, including category icons like L’Oréal Paris, Maybelline and Lancôme. Overseeing a marketing budget exceeding €13 billion annually, Dubey has deepened L’Oréal’s commitment to “beauty tech” by integrating AI-powered diagnostics, virtual try-ons and personalized routines across key brands. Such tools have significantly enhanced customer engagement, with the company reporting over one billion virtual try-ons across its portfolio. Dubey’s influence is evident not just in the growth of the French conglomerate, but the behaviors of the category worldwide. In the past year, L’Oréal launched CREAITECH, an in-house generative AI beauty content lab, announcing a partnership with Nvidia to super-charge it with never seen before beauty experiences, just last week. Dubey has also partnered with Google to integrate its Imagen 3, Gemini and Veo 2 AI models into CREAITECH, creating some 50,000 images and 500 videos monthly, streamlining content production and allowing for rapid localization of marketing materials. Dubey has also transformed L’Oréal’s influencer marketing strategy, expanding collaborations to over 60,000 creators: The extensive network has contributed to L’Oréal achieving a 30% share of global beauty influence. L’Oréal Paris was again the leading beauty brand on social media last year and closedQ1 2025 with a 4.4% increase in sales YoY. Marcel Marcondes Marcondes has influence and oversight over the world’s largest brewer—parent to eight of the 10 most valuable beer brands worldwide, including Corona, Budweiser, and Michelob Ultra—spanning more than 500 brands sold in over 150 countries. With a conviction that creativity is most impactful when applied to solving business and consumer problems, Marcondes ensures the company’s marketing engine drives volume through brand equity, creativity and culture amidst changing consumer attitudes and behaviors. While the company’s portfolio is huge, Marcondes focuses on a “megabrand” strategy, which concentrates marketing investments behind a select group of scalable, emotionally resonant labels in order to build premium stature and global brand consistency. As but one illustration, over the past year, Marcondes’s vision has materialized in the global rollout of Corona Cero, the company’s alcohol-free variant, in more than 40 markets ahead of the Paris Olympics. Marcondes has also broadened the reach of AB InBev’s CreativeX system, a Cannes-modeled internal training and recognition platform that is reported to have measurably improved marketing quality, effectiveness, and creative confidence across regional teams. In June, and for an unprecedented fourth consecutive year, AB InBev was named the world’s most effective marketer by The Effies. As of June 6, the company’s stock was up more than 42% YTD. David Sandstrom Sandström is rewriting the rules of marketing and marketing organization design in the AI era for the Swedish fintech giant, which serves over 150 million users in some 45 countries around the world. With oversight of Klarna’s global brand, creative and consumer strategy, Sandström’s remit also extends into full-stack operational reinvention. Sandström isn’t just using AI to optimize workflows; he’s building an entirely new model for how marketing teams think, create and move at scale, and the broader marketing world is paying attention. Under his leadership, Klarna has embedded generative AI across every stage of its marketing process—what Sandström calls “AI copilots”—with more than 300 custom GPT-powered tools for everything from ideation to insight generation, enabling Klarna’s marketers to function like engineers—faster, leaner, and more iterative than ever before. Through such innovations, Sandström and his team have reduced image production costs by 50% and cut campaign development timelines from six weeks to days, helping save millions annually in sales and marketing spend, while transforming a transactional payments platform into one of the most culturally agile and technologically advanced brands in finance. Sandström’s work has also helped shift the brand from financial utility to cultural relevance. This past March, Klarna partnered with DoorDash to bring its flexible payment tools to everyday categories like grocery and meal delivery, reframing buy now, pay later as a convenience driver, not just a credit alternative. Sandström has helped Klarna become a brand that moves with culture, not behind it. In 2024, the company reported revenues had increased 24% YoY. Asad Ayaz With three titles and three distinct but integrated remits, Ayaz holds one of the most influential marketing roles in entertainment, and shapes how Disney shows up across culture, commerce and marketing storytelling. With oversight spanning global brand strategy, digital engagement, franchise synergy and marketing across Disney’s core content engines—including Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm, 20th Century Studios, and Disney+, in the past year, Ayaz brought together Disney’s two internal creative agencies, Yellow Shoes and The Hive to unify brand and experiences campaigns across parks, streaming, and theatrical content—just as Disneyland enters its 70th anniversary year. He also led the buzz-heavy campaign for “Deadpool & Wolverine,” reframing the R-rated entry as a cultural reset for Marvel with Comic-Con stunts, K-pop integrations, and irreverent global storytelling. Other standout moments include the viral “Apes on Horses” activation for “Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes,” the integrated Hulu-on-Disney+ campaign that merged iconic franchise quotes with surprise character crossovers, and a reimagined D23 fan event that expanded into Fortnite and debuted globally in Brazil. With three billion-dollar films and over $5 billion in global box office, as of June 6, Disney stock was up more than 12% YoY. Tim Ellis With oversight of brand strategy, fan engagement, content and international growth, Ellis leads marketing for one of the world's most influential sports leagues, and the most dominant sports and media property in the U.S. Overseeing a cross-functional team spanning marketing, social, partnerships, media and international, Ellis is focused on bringing new audiences to the game, growing the league’s global reach and ensuring its continued cultural relevance. In the past year, his influence extends across marketing for the NFL's most ambitious international slate to date, as international outreach included regular-season games in São Paulo, Madrid, Dublin, Berlin and London. To recruit, retain and engage fans, Ellis deploys a “helmets off” strategy, one that has been emulated by other leagues, in order to humanize and personalize the game’s biggest names. Under his influence, campaigns have gone beyond the game and sport itself and have included those spotlighting mental health and youth empowerment. The League’s “Every Kid Can Be Somebody” campaign aired during the AFC and NFC Championships and Super Bowl LIX and was one the showcase’s best received and reviewed spots. These efforts, along with others like growing category interest and participation by championing flag football, support the league’s push to build emotional resonance with fans across generations and geographies. Just weeks ago, the League announced NFL players could play in Flag Football’s Olympic Games debut in 2028. The business results speak volumes: for the 2024 fiscal year, the NFL’s total revenue is reported to have grown 13% YoY. Kofi-Amoo-Gottfried Amoo-Gottfried’s influence is reshaping DoorDash—which currently has a dominant 60% share in the U.S. meal delivery market and is aggressively expanding international operations—into a cultural and commercial powerhouse. With an expansive remit leading the company’s brand strategy, creative, media and customer engagement, expanding category awareness and brand affinity are among the areas where Amoo-Gottfried’s influence is most visible. His approach blends cultural fluency with performance rigor and reflects a conviction that "a brand is the sum of all interactions and associations that people have with your product, service, company.” Focused on redefining how the company’s three principal constituencies—consumers, providers and delivery Dashers—think about the brand he stewards, Amoo-Gottfried has helped embed DoorDash as a part of daily life for tens of millions around the world. For the twelve months ending March 31, 2025, the company handled over 2.6 billion orders, reflecting YoY growth of 19%; and in May, DoorDash announced its agreement to acquire U.K.-based Deliveroo for £2.9 billion ($3.86 billion USD), expanding its reach to over 40 countries. As of the close of markets on June 6, the company’s stock was up over 92% YoY. Colin Fleming Fleming is responsible for the global marketing strategy and growing brand recognition worldwide for the $230 billion enterprise software behemoth, with a global remit spanning brand, demand, content, and events. Over the past year and since becoming CMO, Fleming has overhauled the company’s marketing engine, driving a shift from a product-first mindset to a bold, brand-led strategy, elevating storytelling, cultural relevance and emotional resonance in a category not traditionally known for the same. This repositioning, and the approach surrounding it, has included halving the company’s agency roster (an initiative named internally after Marie Kondo to reinforce the joy and efficacy of less) while doubling down on global activations with audience-relevant cultural currency. Under his leadership, marketing has become a strategic partner to the sales organization, rather than the lead factory it had long been. Fleming is helping position ServiceNow as not just a category leader, but a cultural force. His influence extends beyond the company and is found in his recent provocation to the B2B marketing world at large, arguing that it is time enterprise marketers stop marketing with fact-deficient, obfuscating generalities and attribution models and start marketing to humans again, including ditching acronym-heavy language in favor of customer clarity. Kantar recently named Service Now the 41st most valuable brand globally, representing a 57% increase in brand value YoY. As of June 6, the company’s stock was up over 47% in the past year. Lennard Hoornik Over the past year, Hoornik orchestrated one of the most attention-getting brand refreshes globally and is steering both Jaguar and Land Rover through high-stakes transformations. With oversight of the British multi-national company’s global sales, marketing, brand positioning and customer experience, Hoornik’s remit is central to JLR's "Reimagine" strategy, which aims to redefine modern luxury in an automotive category being reshaped by electrification. Hoornik led the much-discussed rebranding of Jaguar, signaling a clean break from the brand’s heritage cues and launching the provocative “Copy Nothing” platform. The campaign, which debuted in two phases with a teaser trailer, immersive installations at Miami Art Week, strategic influencer drops, and a media buy spanning art, design, and tech publications, introduced the company’s Type 00 concept car: a low-slung, all-electric grand tourer embodying Jaguar’s new design philosophy. The rebranding sparked controversy and ignited global discourse, nowhere more than in the marketing world. Discourse aside, the move anchors Jaguar’s plan to go fully electric by 2026 and recalibrate toward design-led, next-gen luxury. Under Hoornik’s marketing leadership, and driven by strong demand and sharper brand differentiation, in FY25 JLR posted record Q3 results, its ninth successive profitable quarter. Claudine Cheever At the helm of marketing for the world’s largest retailer, Cheever oversees 11 global functional teams spanning brand, media, measurement, creative and insights, powering Amazon’s connection with hundreds of millions of customers across an increasingly diversified portfolio, from Prime and retail to healthcare and AI. Cheever has continued pushing Amazon’s massive owned ecosystem—boxes, trucks, devices—as a media platform, creating one of the largest and most efficient out-of-home networks on the planet. Under her marketing influence and leadership, Amazon’s in-house agency was named Ad Age’s 2024 In-House Agency of the Year, reflecting work that balances performance rigor with scaled brand storytelling. This includes emotionally led campaigns like 2024’s “Midnight Opus,” which aired across the U.S., U.K., Germany, and Japan. Cheever is also steering brand expansion into sectors like pharmacy and telehealth, where trust and clarity are critical to adoption. With an annual budget in the billions, she’s building a high-impact global marketing engine that flexes to local markets. Amazon’s brand value rose 50% year-over-year in Kantar’s latest rankings, making it the fourth most valuable brand globally; as of the close of markets on June 3, Amazon’s stock was up nearly 17% YoY. Pinteres With an unusually broad “super function” remit spanning marketing, product design, UX, go-to-market, creative, communications, research and insights, Mallard is shaping Pinterest, one of the world’s most popular social media brands, into the rarest kind of platform: one that grows by making the internet feel better, not louder. Mallard’s remit is unusually broad and deep, as she leads an integrated product, design, research & insights, marketing, communications and creative team to deliver exceptional end-to-end customer experiences. Her influence across the company and category is equally expansive, helping Pinterest become a case study in how to scale without compromising trust or values: With some 570 million global monthly active users, the platform has had so great a surge in Gen Z engagement that the user segment is now the fastest growing and most active in Pinterest’s history. Over the past year, Mallard has advanced Pinterest’s “positive personalization” strategy, leveraging AI and design to surface relevant content tailored for individual users without triggering the social comparison loops that plague much of social media. This ethos of prioritizing utility over virality continues setting Pinterest apart as other social platforms face heightened scrutiny over mental health impacts, misinformation and aggressive monetization tactics. Mallard also continued to evolve Pinterest Predicts, transforming it from an annual trend report into a dynamic business intelligence tool that not only forecasts but increasingly fuels advertiser strategy across fashion, beauty, home and retail sectors. The result: marketers are using Pinterest not just to see what’s coming next, but to act on it. In Q1 2025, Pinterest reported a 16% YoY revenue increase. Frank-Cooper Cooper is redefining the role of marketing at Visa—the world’s largest payments network, facilitating over $12 trillion in annual volume—and the financial services sector broadly. Overseeing brand strategy, global campaigns and customer engagement across more than 200 countries, Cooper’s influence is witnessed in his work to evolve the positioning of the iconic brand from a transaction facilitator to a catalyst for economic empowerment. In the past year, Cooper used the high-profile Oscars telecast to launch Visa’s global Typewriter campaign, a narrative-driven initiative that reimagines Visa’s role in enabling personal growth and opportunity—aligning with the brand’s “Everywhere You Want To Be” ethos by positioning Visa as a partner not just in purchases but in the milestones, ambitions and life moments those purchases make possible. The campaign marked new territory for Visa by leaning into emotionally resonant storytelling that shows how its products, including Visa Direct and Visa Installments, can help people reach personal goals. And while the company’s product teams developed innovations like Visa Intelligent Commerce and Flexible Credential, Cooper has shaped how they’re positioned and marketed globally, framing them as tools that make everyday commerce more personal, intelligent and secure. These strategic efforts have reinforced Visa’s category dominance, and its global market share is nearly double that of its nearest traditional competitor. In Q2 2025, the company reported a 9% YoY revenue increase, and as of June 6, the company’s stock is up more than 32% YoY. Zach Kitschke Instrumental in steering Canva’s evolution from a consumer-first platform to an enterprise-grade design and productivity suite, Kitschke has helped lead the company’s shift into its next growth frontier: B2B and enterprise teams. Since joining the Australian company as its fifth employee, Kitschke has overseen brand, communications, product marketing and go-to-market efforts, shaping how Canva promotes a design-led ethos and scales its influence globally. Over the past year, he drove the launch of Canva’s largest brand campaign to date, “Love Your Work,” reframing design as a daily advantage for any professional, not just creative ones. Timed to coincide with a major platform overhaul and the introduction of new collaboration and brand management features for business teams across marketing, HR, and sales, Kitschke has also led Canva's expansion into non-traditional sectors including education and nonprofits, all supporting a broader community-led growth strategy, and has influenced company efforts to ensure product storytelling and customer insights are aligned. The privately-held company with a valuation near $50 billion, now has 170 million users across 190 countries. Over the past year, the company passed $3B in revenues for the first time, and Kitschke’s influence helped contribute to Canva’s reported 35% revenue increase YoY. Noel Mack Mack isn’t just steering Gymshark’s growth; he is helping architect it. A driving force behind one of the world’s most dynamic apparel brands and one of the U.K.’s only “unicorns,” Mack is helping transform Gymshark into a global brand and business by blending cultural and consumer savvy with an approach redefining the balance and interplay between the digital and physical. While other brands chase broad lifestyle relevance, under Mack’s lead, Gymshark remains unapologetically focused on just one thing: the gym. With a community-and-social-first mindset, Mack’s work finds the brand becoming something of a movement among Gen Z and Millennial consumers for whom going to the gym is not just a routine but an identity. With influence over all brand, marketing, creative and consumer-facing strategies, Mack has been building both the brand and business on social media and with creator partnerships long before they became industry standards. His early embrace of digital community-building wasn’t just a marketing decision; it was and is a business engine. When the brand’s recent release of its cult-status Onyx collection was hijacked by bots, Mack led Gymshark’s response with nothing but the consumer in mind, turning what could have been a crisis into another chapter in its storied community-building work. Gymshark’s "We Do Gym" platform reflects Mack’s laser-focused brand philosophy; while competitors expand laterally into lifestyle categories, Mack keeps Gymshark's identity ruthlessly specific, making it more resonant, not less. That clarity, paired with grassroots digital storytelling, has set a new standard for how brands build relevance without traditional advertising. In FY2025, the privately held company reported a revenue increase of over 9% YoY, and a bootstrapped valuation now exceeding $1.5 billion. Michelle Graham Clare With oversight of the iconic brand’s international marketing (i.e., outside the U.S.), Graham-Clare’s influence and remit extend across creative strategy, brand development and customer engagement for the world’s largest QSR company by market valuation. Over the past year, Graham-Clare has launched another chapter in the company’s fan-first strategy and platform, “Only at McDonald’s,” the global evolution of a U.K. campaign celebrating real customer rituals, and which has since inspired activations in Canada, Germany, and Australia. Under her marketing leadership, culturally attuned work like the U.K.’s “Gift of McDonald’s” holiday spot—directed by Gold Lion award-winner and Danish film-maker Nicolai Fuglsig—was named one of best campaigns of the year, showcasing how locally rooted storytelling can elevate brand meaning and emotional connection at scale. Beyond brand building, Graham-Clare is scaling loyalty and digital engagement through app-based experiences, limited-edition merch drops, and real-time activations meeting customers where they are. Graham-Clare is helping ensure that the iconic global brand stays emotionally relevant, digitally fluent, and locally loved. As of June 6, the company’s stock is up nearly 20% YoY. Charlie Smith Smith’s influence is redefining what luxury marketing looks and sounds like in the modern age—and how luxury brands behave across culture. In steering the LVMH-owned Spanish fashion house (and one of the world’s oldest luxury brands) into a new era, Smith is elevating Loewe’s profile and creating a new playbook for luxury storytelling, blending high-craft heritage with an internet-native wit not typical for luxury brands. Under his marketing leadership, Loewe has become one of fashion’s most digitally fluent and culturally resonant brands, known as much for its ironic tone and sharp social media presence as for its meticulous craftsmanship and bold creative direction. Smith oversees all aspects of Loewe’s brand and consumer communication, leading a global team across marketing, digital, PR, events and celebrity/influencer strategy. His remit spans traditional brand building and future-facing cultural invention — from the recent Crafted World exhibition in Tokyo (a multi-sensory showcase of Loewe’s craftsmanship that drew tens of thousands of reservations in days) to the brand’s viral TikTok strategy, which has attracted a new generation of fans. Loewe’s campaigns now regularly feature a mix of high-fashion polish and unexpected levity, including casting creators and memes alongside red-carpet celebrities, resulting in both virality and brand heat. The impact has been both reputational and financial: Loewe is one of the fastest-growing brands in the LVMH portfolio and, in the first quarter of 2025, sat atop the influential Lyst Index. Cristina Diezhandino With global oversight of marketing, innovation and digital transformation for the world’s fourth-largest alcohol and spirits company (based on market capitalization), Diezhandino’s influence is shaping the trajectory of over 200 brands sold in over 180 countries across the company’s portfolio. Over the past year, and as the category continues to shift and respond to forces ranging from changing consumption behaviors amongst younger generations to tariffs, Diezhandino has reorganized her global team into agile brand communities built for experimentation and speed. Over the past year, to accelerate brand and volume growth in the premium sector, Diezhandino has launched the Diageo Luxury Group to unify its high-end spirits portfolio and drive brand and strategic consistency globally. She has also introduced a virtual studio to better scale content and creative production, while also leading Diageo’s largest-ever consumer data initiative and establishing a global partnerships lab to unlock untapped growth through cultural collaborations. Guided by a mindset of possibility and a belief in progress over perfection, Diezhandino is reshaping how her teams understand and influence the future of socializing, long a category reference point, placing celebrations and cultural relevance at the center of every brand experience. Under her marketing leadership, inclusivity has become a hallmark of brand storytelling so to better reflect a more representative vision of modern drinkers. Nicole-Hubbard-Graham Since rejoining Nike in early 2024, Graham has led the brand’s marketing revival at a moment of existential reckoning. After years of revenue declines, stalled innovation, and an overcorrection toward direct-to-consumer sales and performance marketing, Nike is reorienting around brand storytelling, and Graham has been central to that pivot. She helped conceive and lead the “Winning Isn’t for Everyone” campaign, a bold return to high-impact, athlete-driven storytelling that launched around the Summer Olympics and culminated in Nike’s first Super Bowl appearance in 27 years. The work marked a decisive shift back to the brand’s competitive DNA, earning widespread acclaim and restoring creative credibility. In May, Graham was promoted to EVP and CMO, expanding her remit to include oversight of storytelling across the Nike, Jordan, and Converse brands. She’s also deepening integration with product and design teams to reestablish cultural heat across categories.

Over the past year, Rutledge has also continued advancing American Express’s presence in sports and entertainment with efforts that serve both B2C and B2B interests, including the brand’s high-visibility F1 Academy partnership, which spotlights women-owned businesses; and a revitalized NBA All-Star experience, including the debut of the company sponsored Community All-Star Award. Beyond cultural moments, Rutledge is ensuring American Express continues showing up in times of need, most recently by coordinating with Hilton to provide 20,000-plus free room nights to wildfire evacuees and first responders in California. The company closed Q1 2025 reporting a revenue increase of 9% YoY, and as of June 6, its stock was up 30% YTD. Mayur-Gupta Gupta is helping Kraken, a crypto-trading platform, usher in the age of crypto consumerism—at scale. As the company evolves from their origins into a full-fledged financial services brand, Gupta is steering a marketing strategy that’s equal parts performance engine and brand storyteller. At the heart of his approach is a product-led growth model tied tightly to data: Every user cohort, funnel stage and lifecycle trigger is measured, tested and optimized to drive accountable growth. This discipline has built trust internally, unlocking the ability to invest in brand-building moves that defy easy quantification, and ranging from emotional storytelling to high-profile cultural moments, like Kraken’s partnership with UEFA Europa League champions Tottenham Hotspur. His remit spans the entire marketing stack, blending PLG, lifecycle, performance and brand to create a unified growth system that resonates with crypto natives and newcomers alike. In the last year, Kraken’s revenues increased 128%. Patricia-Corsi Blending creative audacity with sharp commercial instincts, Corsi is reshaping how Kimberly-Clark’s iconic brands show up in the world. Under Corsi’s marketing leadership, the $20 billion global consumer goods giant—home to category leaders like Huggies, Kleenex, Kotex, and Poise—has seen its marketing engine evolve from a traditional, regionally siloed model to a more unified, creativity-led global one. Corsi has driven the company’s largest U.S. expansion in three decades while championing standout work that fused purpose and performance, like Huggies’s emotionally charged North American campaign with NBA star Giannis Antetokounmpo celebrating everyday parenting wins. Poise confronted healthcare inequality with its powerful “Drops of Hope” initiative, and Kotex deepened its global effort to dismantle period stigma through locally resonant storytelling. Under Corsi’s influence, the company has retooled its global creative model to better unite design, brand-building, and business outcomes. Her ethos reflects a culture shift where high-impact creative, not hierarchy, leads decision-making. As of June 2, Kimberly Clark’s stock price was up 5% YoY. Jill_Hazelbaker Hazelbaker is steering one of the world’s most recognizable and widely used tech brands through a new era of reputation, regulation and relevance across the company’s ride-hailing platform, delivery services and freight transport operations. Hazelbaker leads an integrated marketing function designed to ensure Uber shows up with one consistent voice across audiences and markets, and brings marketing, communications and public policy together—a rare structure among global tech firms. Over the past year, Hazelbaker led the launch of Uber’s first global brand platform, “On Our Way.” Debuting during the Paris Olympics with a 90-second in-house spot and a new sonic identity unifying the company’s rideshare and delivery businesses, the campaign marked a continuing shift in Uber’s marketing from more tactical, product-led messaging to emotionally resonant storytelling speaking to riders, regulators and the press alike. Her leadership and influence reflect a broader brand evolution, reframing Uber from a transactional service to an essential part of everyday life. For the quarter ending in March, Uber reported revenues had increased nearly 14% YoY. As of June 6, the company’s stock was up over 35% YTD.

Its revenue, profitability, and cash reserves have skyrocketed since the introduction of ChatGPT over two years ago — and the many competitive generative AI services that have launched since. And its stock price soared. During that period, the world’s leading high-performance GPU maker has used its ballooning fortunes to significantly increase investments in all sorts of startups but particularly in AI startups. The chip giant ramped up its venture capital activity in 2024, participating in 49 funding rounds for AI companies, a sharp increase from 34 in 2023, according to PitchBook data. It’s a dramatic surge in investment compared to the previous four years combined, during which Nvidia funded only 38 AI deals. Note that these investments exclude those made by its formal corporate VC fund, NVentures, which also significantly ramped up its investing in the last two years. (PitchBook says NVentures engaged in 24 deals in 2024, compared to just 2 in 2022.) In 2025, Nvidia has already participated in seven rounds. Nvidia has stated that the goal of its corporate investing is to expand the AI ecosystem by backing startups it considers to be “game changers and market makers.” Below is a list of startups that raised rounds exceeding $100 million where Nvidia is a named participant since 2023, including new ones it has backed so far in 2025, organized from the highest amount to lowest raised in the round. OpenAI: Nvidia backed the ChatGPT maker for the first time in October, reportedly writing a $100 million check toward a colossal $6.6 billion round that valued the company at $157 billion. The chipmaker’s investment was dwarfed by OpenAI’s other backers, notably Thrive, which according to the New York Times invested $1.3 billion. xAI: Nvidia participated in the $6 billion round of Elon Musk’s xAI. The deal revealed that not all of OpenAI’s investors followed its request to refrain from backing any of its direct competitors. After investing in the ChatGPT maker in October, Nvidia joined xAI’s cap table a few months later. Inflection: One of Nvidia’s first significant AI investments also had one of the most unusual outcomes. In June 2023, Nvidia was one of several lead investors in Inflection’s $1.3 billion round, a company founded by Mustafa Suleyman, who earlier founded DeepMind. Less than a year later, Microsoft hired Inflection AI’s founders, paying $620 million for a non-exclusive technology license, leaving the company with a significantly diminished workforce and a less defined future. Wayve: In May, Nvidia participated in a $1.05 billion round for the U.K.-based startup, which is developing a self-learning system for autonomous driving. The company is testing its vehicles in the U.K. and the San Francisco Bay Area. Scale AI: In May 2024, Nvidia joined Accel and other tech giants Amazon and Meta to invest $1 billion in Scale AI, which provides data-labeling services to companies for training AI models. The round valued the San Francisco-based company at nearly $14 billion. Crusoe: A startup building data centers reportedly to be leased to Oracle, Microsoft, and OpenAI raised $686 million in late November, according to an SEC filing. The investment was led by Founders Fund, and the long list of other investors included Nvidia. Figure AI: In February 2024, AI robotics startup Figure raised a $675 million Series B from Nvidia, OpenAI Startup Fund, Microsoft, and others. The round valued the company at $2.6 billion. Mistral AI: Nvidia invested in Mistral for the second time when the French-based large language model developer raised a $640 million Series B at a $6 billion valuation in June. Lambda: AI cloud provider Lambda, which provides services for model training, raised a $480 million Series D at a reported $2.5 billion valuation in February. The round was co-led by SGW and Andra Capital Lambda, and joined by Nvidia, ARK Invest, and others. A significant part of Lambda’s business involves renting servers powered by Nvidia’s GPUs. Cohere: In June, Nvidia invested in Cohere’s $500 million round, a large language model provider serving enterprises. The chipmaker first backed the Toronto-based startup in 2023. Perplexity: Nvidia first invested in Perplexity in November of 2023 and has participated in every subsequent round of the AI search engine startup, including the $500 million round in December, which values the company at $9 billion, according to PitchBook data. Poolside: In October, the AI coding assistant startup Poolside announced it raised $500 million led by Bain Capital Ventures. Nvidia participated in the round, which valued the AI startup at $3 billion. CoreWeave: Nvidia invested in the AI cloud computing provider in April 2023, when CoreWeave raised $221 million in funding. Since then, CoreWeave’s valuation has jumped from about $2 billion to $19 billion, and the company has filed for an IPO. CoreWeave allows its customers to rent Nvidia GPUs on an hourly basis. Together AI: In February, Nvidia participated in the $305 million Series B of this company, which offers cloud-based infrastructure for building AI models. The round valued Together AI at $3.3 billion and was co-led by Prosperity7, a Saudi Arabian venture firm, and General Catalyst. Nvidia backed the company for the first time in 2023. Sakana AI: In September, Nvidia invested in the Japan-based startup, which trains low-cost generative AI models using small datasets. The startup raised a massive Series A round of about $214 million at a valuation of $1.5 billion. Imbue: The AI research lab that claims to be developing AI systems that can reason and code raised a $200 million round in September 2023 from investors, including Nvidia, Astera Institute, and former Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt. Waabi: In June, the autonomous trucking startup raised a $200 million Series B round co-led by existing investors Uber and Khosla Ventures. Other investors included Nvidia, Volvo Group Venture Capital, and Porsche Automobil Holding SE. Ayar Labs: In December, Nvidia invested in the $155 million round of Ayar Labs, a company developing optical interconnects to improve AI compute and power efficiency. This was the third time Nvidia backed the startup. Kore.ai: The startup developing enterprise-focused AI chatbots raised $150 million in December of 2023. In addition to Nvidia, investors participating in the funding included FTV Capital, Vistara Growth, and Sweetwater Private Equity. Sandbox AQ: In April, Nvidia, alongside Google, BNP Paribas, and others, invested $150 million in Sandbox AQ, a startup developing large quantitative models (LQMs) for handling complex numerical analysis and statistical calculations. The investment increased Sandbox AQ’s Series E round to $450 million and the company’s valuation to $5.75 billion. Hippocratic AI: This startup, which is developing large language models for healthcare, announced in January that it raised a $141 million Series B at a valuation of $1.64 billion led by Kleiner Perkins. Nvidia participated in the round, along with returning investors Andreessen Horowitz, General Catalyst, and others. The company claims that its AI solutions can handle non-diagnostic patient-facing tasks such as pre-operating procedures, remote patient monitoring, and appointment preparation. Weka: In May, Nvidia invested in a $140 million round for AI-native data management platform Weka. The round valued the Silicon Valley company at $1.6 billion. Runway: In June of 2023, Runway, a startup building generative AI tools for multimedia content creators, raised a $141 million Series C extension from investors, including Nvidia, Google, and Salesforce. Bright Machines: In June 2024, Nvidia participated in a $126 million Series C of Bright Machines, a smart robotics and AI-driven software startup. Enfabrica: In September 2023, Nvidia invested in networking chips designer Enfabrica’s $125 million Series B. Although the startup raised another $115 million in November, Nvidia didn’t participate in the round. Editor’s note: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that Nvidia is a backer of Safe Superintelligence and an investor in Vast Data’s Series E round. Nvidia hasn’t invested in Vast Data since the company’s Series D. Topics Reporter, Venture From seed to Series C and beyond—founders and VCs of all stages are heading to Boston.
