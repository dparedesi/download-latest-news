We’ve reached a new stage in the AI boom. Big Tech earnings — and the rest of the market — have been bolstered by the AI era. But now, Wall Street is expecting more than just promises. Are these companies set up for success? Or is it a pressure they can’t quite handle? This transcript was prepared by a transcription service. This version may not be in its final form and may be updated. Jeremy Owens: Hello, and welcome to On Watch by MarketWatch. I'm Jeremy Owens. It's been another busy week here at MarketWatch as we cover the election. While the Newsroom continues to dive into Donald Trump's win and what it means for the economy, we wanted to make sure you didn't miss some other very important numbers, Big Tech's earnings and AI promises. So today we're going to visit with Dan Gallagher, the Wall Street Journal's Heard on the Street tech columnist. Plus, we'll tell you about other news we're watching this election week, including the Federal Reserve meeting and how all of it will impact your wallet. Last week, Microsoft executives finally answered Wall Street's big question, how much is the company actually making from generative AI? The company expects to surpass 10 billion in annual revenue from AI next quarter. That number might've pushed the stock higher three or six months ago, but after this report, the market had a scary Halloween. Microsoft's stock dropped 6%, pulling the S&P 500 into the red on the last day of October. That ended a five-month winning streak for the market. The problem? Microsoft's forecast was a little shy of Wall Street expectations for cloud growth, which just felt so 2022. And it wasn't just Microsoft. All the Big Tech stocks seemed to move less on their executives' AI promises and more on actual financial performance. So what happened in this round of earnings, and what does it mean for the future? To answer those questions, I brought in Dan Gallagher, who covers tech for the Wall Street Journal's Heard on the Street column. Here's what he told me about what happened with Microsoft. Dan Gallagher: I think especially if you compare to this time last year when AI hype was just driving everything and these companies could raise the CapEx to (inaudible) levels and just blow money out the door, and get rewarded for it because investors saw all upside in the future and they realized obviously, nothing was going to happen that year. ChatGPT had just launched. So I think it's now like we're a year ahead, money is still going out the door in even more obscene amounts, and it's going to keep getting bigger next year. Jeremy Owens: Yeah, that $10 billion figure that Microsoft mentioned pales in comparison to what they're saying they're going to spend on capital expenditures on building out this AI infrastructure. Dan Gallagher: Yeah. And to drill on that $10 billion number a little bit, we got to realize that okay, one, that's including a lot of stuff, things like OpenAI. OpenAI sends a lot of their compute to Microsoft. That helps the Azure number some. And especially with Microsoft, I think investors are starting to get a little bit more picky about what they want to see. In particular, there's a lot of questions about, is Copilot generating anything? Jeremy Owens: Yeah. And Copilot is the AI software they're selling, and we've talked about on this program before as the true test of this AI cycle hype. Obviously, we're seeing a lot of hardware sales and cloud computing sales go through, but it's that next lug, the software, is that going to sell? And that's why that's so important, is because Microsoft is out there in front of all these others, and if they can sell the software, it shows that maybe others can as well. Dan Gallagher: Exactly. And we don't really know how that's going for them yet. In terms of what Copilot specifically is bringing out, I think there's not so much skepticism on that 10 billion number, but it didn't really answer a lot of the questions that more on Wall Street actually have. There's different demands for AI. There's obviously these AI companies that are using cloud services right now because they need to train their models, a ton of compute there. But at the end of the day, the future of AI is going to be our businesses and consumers paying and paying extra for AI tools and AI services. So, Copilot is really central to that. Jeremy Owens: But it seems like companies now are willing to just put it in front of as many people as possible in their organization to see how they use it. At some point, they're going to have to look and say, "Well, how many people are actually using it?" For a lot of white-collar execs, it's like, "Oh good, we get a meeting transcript." Is that worth 30 bucks a month to the company for everybody to have access to those meeting transcripts? That's a big question moving forward. Dan Gallagher: Yeah. And we've seen a term, it's a jargony term, but we call it rationalization. Rationalization is when you have a company that's looking at its spending on things like software and cloud services and thinks, okay, maybe we're spending a little too much here, we need to bring it back, or we need to match our spending with what we're actually using. We saw that with all the cloud services a couple years ago where they had a huge jump of growth in COVID, but after a couple years of that, there was this need to kind of, okay, not everything's being used. We need to bring our budgets in order. So I think we'll probably see those dynamics play out over the medium term with things Copilot. It'll all come down to, is there actual use happening on the ground? It's still too early I think to really see that on a mass scale, and I think one of the things that... It's going to test investors' patience, is that people change their work habits really slowly and reluctantly, even if a new tool comes along that says, "Oh, this is going to make it a lot easier." So I think that's another thing that investors have to factor in, is that to get the take-up, it's going to take time. Jeremy Owens: What Microsoft said about AI did not cause its stock to drop 6%. It really was about the forecast being just a tiny bit soft, and that's very standard. This goes back to where we were before all the AI hype. To me, it was like it's all about the forecast and your actual results, and nothing Microsoft said made me think 6% less of them. Dan Gallagher: Yeah. Microsoft historically, they're not aggressive with their forecasts, so I don't think I recall ever seeing them do what I would call a blowout forecast. Very conservative. I think you have to also factor in, last week's market was just a jittery market overall. I saw a lot of trades last week that seemed extreme up or down based on what the results were. We're not talking about Uber today, but Uber had a really big fall because they missed their gross bookings guide, but they've missed that a lot of times. So I think you have to factor that in a little bit to how the shares traded, but I do think we're definitely past the honeymoon phase of the AI hype and investors want to see more meat on the bone. Jeremy Owens: And we did get some of that meat. Amazon, while they didn't say the exact number, they did say they are on a multi-billion revenue run rate with AI, so a little bit more generic. We have to figure most of that is cloud. Dan Gallagher: Exactly. Amazon doesn't have really a strong, what we call a SaaS or an apps business like Office, Excel, all those Microsoft has, so a lot of their stuff is really under the hood stuff that companies are using. I think that's going to be honestly a harder thing for them to break out longer term, how much of that is being used by AI companies for compute versus other companies using AI-generated tools? It'll be interesting to see what they do with that longer term, because Amazon historically doesn't like to give a lot of specific breakouts. Think about all the years they've sold the Kindle reader. They've never made a quarterly disclosure of how many Kindles they sold, even way back when that was their first device and there was an interest in doing it. They just didn't do that. So I think with them, I don't see a line item coming. Jeremy Owens: What I take away from a lot of these reports, Dan, is that investors are now looking at these companies' core businesses again instead of focusing on general AI chatter. Dan Gallagher: Yeah. And the funny thing with Amazon was that they got a bounce even though they did the biggest CapEx jump of any of the companies, and it was shocking actually to see the number they spent in the third quarter relative to what expectations were. There was a lot of interesting dynamics with them because in their last quarter, they had teased the fact that, because they're also doing the satellite program, these satellites to compete with Starlink that are going to provide web-based services, and hinted that they were going to start having launch costs work into it. And so there was this growing worry on Wall Street saying, "Well, street estimates for earnings are too high because nobody's factoring in these costs." And Amazon's profit margins are really key to the appeal because they've been going up and up and up the last few years, so I think the fact that their margins came in and stayed strong and their forecast for margins was really strong, which it generally is not, they usually give themselves a huge wiggle room there, that was enough to kind of boost them even past a huge CapEx jump. And even with a kind of fuzzy AI disclosure, it was good enough. Jeremy Owens: Yeah. And you bring up profit margins, the Big Tech's profit margins are driving the S&P 500's profit margins higher. Since the layoffs in late 2022, early '23, the Big Tech private margins have just gotten bigger, and we continue to see evidence of this. And you brought up in one of your articles about the earnings last week about Google, where they brought on, I think, 1700 new employees in the third quarter, which seems like a really big total until you look at Google's history. And they had averaged about 7,000 new employees for the third quarter over the past five years. And then hearing Google also say that 25% of its coding is now being done by AI. This just continues to hit for me that Big Tech is trying to put themselves together in a way that it shows their corporate customers what they can do. Dan Gallagher: Yeah. And I think the timing works out well for them in that sense too. They lagged behind. We saw Meta do this big year of efficiency back in late '22, mostly '23, that they fired a lot of people, their revenue per employee went up, the stock really took off, and Google was lagging on that. They just didn't show any sign that they were going to do something that drastic. And so the fact that they have shown now that they're watching their cost, getting the efficiency help, maybe not with as drastic a number as Meta delivered, it's good for them. And then yeah, the timing with the fact that they have these AI tools now at a certain phase of development where they can be used like that is definitely, I think, going to help them. Jeremy Owens: But with Google, it is an advertising business. They actually do have enterprise, so they can make that pitch. Meta is the one, and I still call them Facebook, but Facebook also is a advertising company. Dan Gallagher: Even more so than Google. Jeremy Owens: Yeah, yeah, exactly. People want to talk about their social networks or whatever else they do, but these companies sell ads. That's how they make money. And both their ad businesses are going bonkers good right now. And Zuckerberg talks about the ad business, and obviously AI is helping their ads business, but I still don't understand what the business case is for all the AI spend he's doing. He promised to continue spending money on AI gear, and I just don't see where the money is for Facebook from AI besides better ad tools. Dan Gallagher: I think that's one big part of the appeal with it, especially when you consider that their core advertising business is now getting operating margins of like 50%-plus. Basically, right now, they're still in a phase where they can get away with a certain amount, because they show that they can do a pretty harsh turn. Let's go back to this Metaverse thing, the market brutally punished them when they said, "We're going to change our name and spend all this money to build a metaverse," and nobody understood what it was, and the market rebelled. And I'll give Zuckerberg a little credit here, he saw what happened and made a pretty hard pivot and said, "Okay, well, we're done with that." Not necessarily done, they still have- Jeremy Owens: No, he still doesn't say that. Dan Gallagher: They made a hard pivot in terms of the kind of things they were spending, the employee footprint they had. They made some pretty drastic changes quickly, which I think impressed a lot of investors. So I think they get a fair amount of benefit of the doubt right now. A year from now, if they're still spending this kind of amounts but the margin growth and everything has slowed, do they still get that or do they have more people asking exactly what you're asking, "What's the future upside of this?" It's probably not going to come from $300 glasses. Jeremy Owens: Right. Dan Gallagher: But if people took those up in a wide number and then got comfortable with things like AI and hardware, and started to be open to the fact of spending on services, there's potential there. Meta is not a company that's like, "We're going to be in the glasses business." For them, the glasses are a vehicle to get their technology into consumers' hands. Jeremy Owens: We're going to take a quick break. Coming up, can Apple find a generative AI payday, and what does all this mean for NVIDIA? Welcome back. Let's get into Apple earnings and the iPhone's AI debut. I think Wall Street is coming to the realization that AI is not a 2024 story. It's really a late 2025 story at best, at this point, and I think the best example of that is Apple. Apple brought out its Apple Intelligence last week. It actually released the program, which you need either this year's iPhone or last year's iPhone to access. And then they gave their earnings and forecast basically flat iPhone sales for this holiday season. It's basically admitting this is a late 2025 story if it actually does come around, and generative AI is a consumer product that makes consumers want to spend money. Dan Gallagher: Exactly. And I think even that's iffy at the moment, just given the fact that so far, AI-enabled devices have not proved big sellers. Consumers are not yet sold on this idea that they need a device with onboard AI capabilities like the iPhone, like the Samsung phone, like these PCs we're seeing. So I think for Apple, it's this Apple Intelligence launch, but not everything is going to be in it. So the stuff they showed off over the summer, that's slowly coming over the next year. So if you're a prospective iPhone buyer and your current device is working fine and you're thinking, well, maybe this AI thing's worth it, you're going to wait. Apple always has this base of fans that are anxious to get the new thing whenever it comes out, but more of them, especially at the price these phones are even without an AI surcharge, these are expensive phones. And historically, the things that have really sparked these super cycles are when there's a big hardware change, when the screen gets bigger, when they started the Pro models and had these much fancier cameras. You've seen things like that spike. And you also have the fact that people hold onto their phones longer, so if you've had a big uptick one year and those people hold on of their phone for let's say three years, four years, then you're going to have a naturally bigger uptick. But we haven't seen a lot of cases where software alone has sparked any kind of super cycle, and that was the "what if" coming into this, like even if Apple Intelligence was amazing, was that going to really drive people to do it? Jeremy Owens: I want to get to my general takeaways, and the first one's really easy and simple. NVIDIA is still fine. All these executives got on their earnings calls and said, "Hey, we're going to keep spending money for all this AI gear," and that was just music to Jensen Huang's ears. Dan Gallagher: Totally. If only Amazon had done their increase with the amount they increased, NVIDIA would be fine. Jeremy Owens: Right, right. Dan Gallagher: That was such a huge increase. But yes, they're all spending more. Jeremy Owens: Well, NVIDIA is going to replace Intel in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, big move. NVIDIA coming into Intel shows the Dow trying to represent what is the market today. Dan Gallagher: The interesting risk with switching NVIDIA for Intel... Obviously Intel is greatly diminished, having a lot of trouble, like its days were numbered. That was clear. But when this conversation first came up earlier this year, I thought, well, there's some risks with NVIDIA, because technically, NVIDIA has multiple businesses because they were historically a video game chip company. Data center business grew up because companies were wanting those chips in their data centers. Well, it's pretty much all AI at the moment. Intel PCs were their dominant business, but it's not as dominant in Intel's model as it is in NVIDIA's. So in a way, NVIDIA is going to be always a little more of a volatile name because at some point when AI spending rationalizes and companies start to say, "Okay, well, we're going to not grow it as much," you're going to see NVIDIA stock may get really volatile, because right now, it just trades on this assumption that the spending's going up in a huge way. But it's going to be interesting to see how the effect plays out, especially in the years ahead as NVIDIA's business reaches like, what's maybe a new normal? How does the stock behave? I think it's going to go through some wild gyrations. Jeremy Owens: On the other side, and this was always something I thought about this technology but I'm just more baked in now that this is an enterprise technology and not really a consumer technology yet. And so that's good for Microsoft, Amazon and Google, which do sell enterprise generative AI products and cloud and software, while Meta and Apple are a little bit more questionable for me moving forward just on how they make money off of this. Dan Gallagher: I think so. But I think of Meta though not necessarily as consumer or enterprise, because remember, most of Meta's money is coming from businesses who are paying to advertise. So as long as they see value, and if generative AI makes Meta an even better advertising tool, they're going to be fine. For Apple, it's really tricky because if Apple's going to get AI into people's hands, it has to happen through their hardware. But the good news for NVIDIA, it doesn't matter what happens with Apple. Jeremy Owens: No, as long as Microsoft, Amazon, and Zuckerberg keep on spending- Dan Gallagher: Exactly. Jeremy Owens: ... they're fine. And so lastly, it feels like we've entered a new cycle in this AI hype era. It seemed like last year, all you had to do was say, "AI," your stock went up. This year, investors wanted numbers, and they've gotten a few more numbers or at least more specifics. And now we've reached this place where even a very specific big AI number for Microsoft did not help because everybody was looking at the traditional businesses. And it seems like a golden era for these Big Tech companies, to me. They've got good finances, they've got good core businesses, and they've still got this promise of AI returns in the future. And so they're sitting here, and I don't know how they go higher from here, but I also don't know how they get cut off at the knees, because they have that magic formula that Wall Street loves. Dan Gallagher: Exactly. So I think we're going to see this next year, is they're going to be fine on their core businesses. I think we're going to enter a phase where everything needs to go right. If you have an earnings report that's pretty strong on the core but the AI stuff isn't impressing, your stock's probably not going to do well, and the vice versa. You need to deliver both, because when you're spending this kind of money, you do need to show return at some point. They're not going broke, any of them, but this is a lot of money going out the door, and the questions are just going to keep growing and growing. Jeremy Owens: So enjoy this time now, Mark and Satya, and all you other executives who had such a good run this earnings season, because next year you're going to have to bring good core performance and AI evidence, and it still may not be enough. We'll see what the AI evidence shows- Dan Gallagher: Just do it all. Jeremy Owens: Yeah, yeah- Dan Gallagher: That's all you got to do- Jeremy Owens: Just do it all for us. Yeah, you're worth trillions of dollars. You got to show up for it. Well, Dan, thank you so much for what you do, and thank you so much for joining us here on On Watch. Dan Gallagher: Well, thanks for having me. Jeremy Owens: Before we go, it's time for what we are watching, a look at the news you need to know for the rest of the week and beyond. Tuesday's election went Republicans' way with Donald Trump winning the presidency and the GOP retaking the Senate. There are a lot of implications here for the economy and the market, from the effects of mass deportations to the likelihood of friendly rules for the cryptocurrency industry. We'll be back to discuss those issues and more in depth next week. The October jobs report came in last Friday and it was disappointing, with only 12,000 new jobs added. While that number was much lower than expected, it really shouldn't have been too surprising. Two hurricanes and a massive strike at Boeing dragged down a month that is typically big for hiring. Despite those underlying factors, the jobs report still reflects a labor market that is not strong. The Federal Reserve has certainly been discussing that jobs report in its meeting, which began yesterday and will run through today. The board is expected to cut another 25 basis points from its core interest rate and Chairman Jerome Powell will face the press today to discuss the decision. And that's it for this episode.

Title: Justices skeptical about Facebook’s data breach disclosure to investors

The justices heard arguments Wednesday in Facebook v. Amalgamated Bank, their first securities case of the year. The case involves the 2015 Cambridge Analytica-Facebook data breach, and considers whether Facebook’s disclosures to investors before the breach was public improperly downplayed the risks that data breaches posed to the company and its stock price. Shareholders sued Facebook in 2018 after they learned that Cambridge Analytica had obtained the personal data of 30 million Facebook users. The shareholders conted that Facebook misled them about the risks to their investment. Although some justices seemed more receptive to the argument of Kannon Shanmugam (representing Facebook), the dominant tone was skepticism. The headwinds started in the first minutes of the argument, with Justice Clarence Thomas offering an off-hand assessment that “a reasonable person” would assume from a statement like Facebook’s that nothing bad of this sort ever had happened to it. Shanmugam quickly faced similar perspectives from Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson, who compared Facebook’s disclosures to a homeowner suggesting that crime might be a risk to values in the future without mentioning a string of recent burglaries in the neighborhood. To the casual observer, there are not a lot of five-justice majorities that skip over those three justices. That’s not to say that it was all bad for Facebook. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh were the most reluctant to accept this as enough to justify a class action against Facebook. For Roberts, Facebook’s disclosure was more like a statement that you should be careful about walking down his front steps, because you might fall – a statement from which you might infer that somebody had fallen in the past. For him, the subjectivity of determining what a factfinder might infer from any particular disclosure made it “kind of a blank check” to “go to trial to decide” how to interpret the disclosure. In the same vein, Kavanaugh thought it central that the Securities and Exchange Commission already has rules that require companies explicitly to disclose lots of adverse past events in various disclosures – and this is not on the list. For him, it makes no sense for “the judiciary … to walk the plank on this … when the SEC could do it.” As he put it, “[t]he SEC knows how to write regulations that require disclosure of past events. … Why not let the SEC do this if they want to?” Past experience suggests it is hard to imagine a unanimous Supreme Court affirming a decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit expanding liability under the securities laws, so I certainly would not want to overread the argument. What I would say is this was not a compelling day for Meta. We’ll have to wait for the opinions in the spring to see what they actually decide.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks held onto gains as investors digested a fresh interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve and Donald Trump's electoral victory. In a widely expected move, the Fed cut interest rates by 25 basis points on Thursday, lowering its benchmark rate to a range of 4.5% to 4.75%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose roughly 0.6%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) moved up than 1.3% as shares of chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) and e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN) rose to new highs. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) traded right around the flat line, on the heels of a 1,500-point gain that marked the blue-chip gauge's best day since 2022. Spirits still appeared buoyant after Trump's presidential election win, which sent all three major stock gauges soaring to fresh record highs on Wednesday. His plans for corporate tax cuts and deregulation have fueled optimism for a boost to the economy that will feed into stocks. The Fed's interest rate decision later Thursday could be the next catalyst that moves markets. Aside from the rate cut, the focus is on what Chair Jerome Powell might reveal about the future path of policy, especially as Trump's return could mean rates stay higher for longer. On the corporate front, Arm Holdings (ARM) stock rose about 4% after amid a broader tech rally despite the chip designer's revenue forecast disappointing Wall Street's hopes for stronger, AI-powered growth. Peer Qualcomm's (QCOM) shares were near flat after its sales and profit outlooks topped estimates. Meanwhile, Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) continued to pull back from the big spike that followed the election result. Shares in the company — the home of Trump's social media platform, Truth Social — fell by double digits during the session. The Fed's next policy decision is less than 30 minutes away. Here's a look at where markets sit before Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell's closely followed press conference at 2:30 p.m. ET. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) was up 0.6%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) moved up than 1.2% as shares of chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) and e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN) rose to new highs. Broadly, big tech led the market action with all of the "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks up more than 1% on the day, led by more than 3% pop in Meta (META). In bonds, a recent move higher in yields took a breather, with the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) falling about 7 basis points to 4.35%. Below is a look at the sector action for the day where Information Technology (XLK) is leading the way. Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports: The Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points Thursday and avoid any unnecessary surprises less than two days after the election of Donald Trump as the next president. "They'd rather just cut, keep their heads down and not say anything all that new," said Luke Tilley, chief economist for Wilmington Trust. Still, that doesn’t mean the discussion today in Washington will necessarily be a smooth one. Fed policymakers will have to make sense of recent data indicating a strong economy, persistent inflation, and a muddled jobs market disrupted by weather and worker strikes. And there could be a debate between those who want to cut, those who could support a pause, and those who would support a cut combined with language designed to communicate a more gradual approach to future reductions.

"Exuberance lies ahead," Julian Emanuel, who leads the equity, derivatives, and quantitative strategy team at Evercore ISI, wrote in a note to clients Wednesday night. "President-Elect Trump will move fast on policy initiatives, and stocks will move fast in response." Emanuel, who already had a 6,000 call on the S&P 500 for 2024, now sees the S&P 500 hitting 6,600 by the end of June 2025, about an 11% increase from its current level. A "public reengaged in speculation," as evidenced by Wednesday's market action with bitcoin (BTC-USD) hitting 76,000 for the first time and Tesla (TSLA) stock soaring 14%, could help drive the benchmark index higher, per Emanuel. Read more here. Yahoo Finance's Claire Boston reports: Mortgage rates rose for a sixth consecutive week, following Treasury yields as they climbed higher through the presidential election. The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rose to 6.79% through Wednesday, up from 6.72% a week earlier, according to Freddie Mac data. The average 15-year fixed-rate mortgage was essentially unchanged, to 6% from 5.99%. Mortgage rates typically mirror 10-year Treasury yields, which rose quickly in recent weeks as traders grew increasingly confident that former President Donald Trump would win Tuesday’s election and implement inflationary policies like tariffs. Read more here. About 24 hours after Donald Trump won the presidential election, American CEOs are already weighing on how the president-elect's policies could impact their business. For one, Trump's proposed increases on tariffs are expected to weigh on retailers. On Wednesday, Steve Madden (SHOO) CEO Edward Rosenfeld said his company has been “planning for a potential scenario in which we would have to move goods out of China more quickly.” “Our goal over the next year is to reduce that percentage of goods that we sourced from China by approximately 40% to 45%, which means that if we’re able to achieve that and we think we have the plan to do it, that a year from today, we would be looking at just over a quarter of our business that would be subject to potential tariffs on Chinese goods,” the shoemaker's CEO said. Trump's presidency is also expected to be less restrictive on mergers and acquisitions. Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) CEO David Zaslav said Thursday Trump's second term could provide an opportunity for more consolidation in the media industry. "We have an upcoming new administration, and it's too early to tell, but it may offer a pace of change and an opportunity for consolidation that may be quite different," Zaslav said on a call with analysts following the company's third quarter results. Raymond James analysts on Thursday downgraded shares of DHI (DHI), saying that in the wake of Trump's election win, they view mortgage rates staying “higher for longer” and constraining housing affordability. The investment firm downgraded DHI to Market Perform from Outperform but kept the same price target at $195.00. It lowered its fiscal year 2025 EPS estimates to $13.25 from $15.80 and projects an EPS estimate of $15.00 in the fiscal year of 2026. Due to “the near-term pressures we see on entry level homebuilders, whose core first-time buyers are likely to face even greater affordability challenges this spring,” Buck Horne, director at Raymond James & Associates, wrote in a note to clients. "Coming out of a volatile October, DHI was already facing pressure from a more competitive inventory environment, rising rates, and buyers’ election anxiety,” Horne added. The bearish call comes as DHI reported weaker-than-expected home orders for its fiscal fourth quarter as high mortgage rates dampened buyer affordability. Netflix (NFLX) stock has surged to another all-time high as tech rallies after Donald Trump clinched victory over Kamala Harris in the presidential election. The stock is currently trading above $790 a share and has climbed more than 60% since the start of the year, with 10% gains over the past month — far outpacing broader markets. The moves higher extend beyond the recent Trump-fueled rally, however, as Netflix stands out among a list of battered media sector names. The streamer has added more than 50 million paying subscribers since launching its password crackdown in May 2023. Its projected full-year operating margins are expected to hit 27%, with management hinting the company has the potential to eventually secure margins similar to broadcast networks, which historically have been in the range of 40% to 50%. And in the first three quarters of 2024, Netflix pulled in roughly $6.9 billion in net income. Its competitors aren't even close. Disney (DIS) and Paramount Global (PARA) just reported their first quarter of profits in their respective streaming businesses earlier this summer. A shift for the industry, yes, but not a cure-all for the problems that have plagued traditional media, with Comcast (CMCSA) the most recent company to weigh spinning off its cable networks. "Netflix is clearly running away with the ball and the media-based streaming companies are struggling to even get on the field," Barton Crockett, managing director at Rosenblatt Securities, previously told Yahoo Finance. Read more about Netflix's dominance here and why analysts say it's won the hard-fought streaming wars. Lyft (LYFT) shares soared more than 25% after its third quarter earnings beat expectations. Lyft’s adjusted earnings per share of $0.29 were ahead of the $0.20 expected, while quarterly revenue of $1.5 billion beat Wall Street’s estimate of $1.4 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates. Rides for the period ended Sept. 30 totaled 217 million, above the 213 million expected. On Wednesday, Lyft announced partnerships with autonomous vehicle companies as it looks to secure a foothold in the burgeoning market, adding driverless cabs to its network in Atlanta in 2025. Wall Street analysts in notes to investors Thursday gave kudos to Lyft’s expansions beyond ride-hailing. “LYFT is no longer a ride-hailing pure-play with it now embarking on partnerships in food delivery and AVs,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst and Lyft bull Brad Erickson. Lyft recently unveiled a partnership with DoorDash (DASH). Still, analysts overall maintained Neutral ratings on the stock, with Wedbush analyst Scott Devitt, writing, “[W]e wait for clear evidence of a more sustainable growth trajectory for the business.” Lyft shares are up 74% from last year but far below highs in the $60 range in 2021. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) briefly touched new highs just north of $76,000, extending gains from Wednesday's monster rally following Donald Trump's White House win. The cryptocurrency jumped to new records on Wednesday and crypto-related stocks also rose following the presidential election results. Over the summer Trump promised to make the US the crypto capital of the world and form a 'strategic bitcoin stockpile.' Shares of AI chip heavyweight Nvidia (NVDA) and e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN) each gained more than 1% on Thursday, extending gains from Wednesday's monster rally following Donald Trump's White House victory. Both stocks closed at all-time record highs on Wednesday. Earlier this week Nvidia surpassed iPhone maker Apple (AAPL) as the largest company in the world. The artificial intelligence chipmaker is expected to join the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) on Friday, replacing semiconductor giant Intel (INTC). Meanwhile, Amazon stock has been in an upward trend after the company posted a stronger-than-expected quarterly result last week. On Thursday, shares were trading just above $210 each. Another batch of companies reported earnings Thursday morning. Moderna (MRNA) jumped 5% at the market open as its earnings beat expectations partly thanks to better-than-anticipated COVID vaccine sales. Warner Bros. (WBD) jumped 10% thanks to streaming growth as Max subscribers soared. Meanwhile, Hershey (HSY) fell more than 1% after sinking as much as 3% premarket as high cocoa prices cut into its sales outlook for the year. Here’s a closer look at how the companies performed: Hershey: Adjusted earnings per share of $2.34 vs. $2.56 per share expected, revenue of $2.99 billion vs. $3.07 billion expected Moderna: Earnings per share of $0.03 vs. a loss of $1.98 per share expected, revenue of $1.86 billion vs. $1.25 billion expected Warner Bros.: Adjusted earnings per share of $0.05 vs. a loss of $0.12 per share expected, revenue of $9.62 billion vs. $9.81 billion expected Meanwhile, energy companies traded flattish after showing mixed results as natural disasters impacted some of their businesses. Duke Energy (DUK) saw its profits hit by hurricane costs, while Pacific Gas & Electric (PCG) missed on revenue just as it shut off power in Northern California amid fire risks. Nuclear power provider Vistra soared 11% after an earnings beat as it recovers from earlier losses. Stocks extended their gains on Thursday following a monster rally on the heels of Donald Trump's White House victory. The move higher in stocks comes ahead of the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) inched up 0.1% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose roughly 0.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) moved up 0.5% after all three major averages closed at record highs on Wednesday. As Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports, the Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates by 25 basis points and avoid any unnecessary surprises after the election of Trump as the next president. Meanwhile, parts of the "Trump Trade" showed some signs of unwinding on Thursday as Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) sank by double digits, reversing the gains it enjoyed in the prior session. Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) sank by double digits in premarket trading on Thursday, reversing the gains it enjoyed on Wednesday as Donald Trump clinched victory over Kamala Harris in the presidential election. As Yahoo Finance's Allie Canal reports, shares in the company — the home of Trump's social media platform, Truth Social — have been on a wild ride over the past week, with the up-and-down moves mostly tied to Trump's chances of reclaiming the White House. The stock is down about 10% over the past five days, although shares have rallied nearly 120% in the past month. Read more here. Initial jobless claims jumped to 221,000 last week, an increase of 3,000 from the previous week's revised level, according to data released by the US Department of Labor on Thursday morning.

Title: The world’s best gaming CPU launches today – here’s where to find the 9800X3D

Enthusiasts take note; the new best CPU for gaming is out, but it's selling fast. Here's what you need to know. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The much-anticipated Ryzen 7 9800X3D has officially launched following months of rumors and speculation. It comes on the heels of AMD's standard Ryzen 9000 desktop chips, released in August 2024, which Senior Editor Ben Wilson favorably reviewed. Wilson also reviewed the new Ryzen 7 9800X3D, calling it "the best gaming CPU" and handing it a Windows Central Best Award. That's despite a higher launch price (by $30) than the Ryzen 7 7800X3D predecessor, which is still available today. I'm still expecting to see more Ryzen 9000 X3D chips to launch in the future, but I'd be surprised if the 9800X3D doesn't remain the most popular choice for gamers for a long time. November 8, 9:10 AM EST: The Ryzen 7 9800X3D is back in stock at Amazon but remains unavailable at Newegg, Best Buy, and B&H Photo. Pre-built custom PCs featuring the chip are still available; details below. — Ben Wilson AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D AMD's new $479 Ryzen 7 9800X3D delivers a second-gen 3D V-Cache that pushes gaming performance beyond even the stellar Ryzen 7 7800X3D predecessor. If you want the absolute best processor for PC gaming, there's really no other option. 👉 Available at: Best Buy | Newegg | Amazon | B&H It shouldn't come as much of a surprise to anyone who's been following the latest Zen 5 rumors that the Ryzen 7 9800X3D has surpassed its predecessor to become the best new CPU for PC gamers. Senior Editor Ben Wilson tested the 9800X3D using an MSI MPG X870E Carbon WiFi motherboard, Liquid Freezer III 360 cooler, and G.Skill Trident Z5 Neo RGB DDR5 RAM. In his Ryzen 7 9800X3D review, he stated: "Make no mistake: the Ryzen 7 9800X3D is the best gaming CPU, politely dethroning its predecessor as the new king of the hill as a cache-heavy monster. However, it's not winning any awards for productivity. It isn't worth installing into a PC that spends most of its time crunching numbers in Microsoft Office and Teams since the 9900X and 9950X dominate that category, but it's a far better pick for gamers than anything from Intel's modern productivity-centric offerings. Unfortunately, those who'll benefit most will need to spend a sizeable amount of cash on a new motherboard and RAM upgrades, making the 9800X3D MSRP hike sting a little more than a cute $30. Nevertheless, this is the new meta for PC gaming, and nothing else can challenge its ability to deliver monstrous FPS counts if you can pair it with a capable GPU to enjoy the latest AAA titles loaded with visual luxuries." All the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards. Like the predecessor Ryzen 7 7800X3D, this is a processor intended mainly for gaming. Its productivity scores, as Wilson states, aren't exceptional, falling behind even the Core Ultra 5 245K in a bunch of productivity benchmarks. Here's a look at the results. As expected, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D's performance absolutely shines in games. As you can see below, it pulls far ahead of Intel's latest Core Ultra 9 285K flagship in demanding games. That's despite the Core Ultra 9 having more cores, more threads, a higher clock speed, and a higher TDP. Wilson also pulled a bunch of real-world benchmarks from the games listed in the chart above for a better idea of where performance lies. These are some of the most demanding games out there right now, but it's clear that the Ryzen 7 9800X3D has no problems running them. Standout metrics include the Ryzen 7 9800X3D reaching a 52% performance increase in Cyberpunk 2077, as well as a 43% increase to performance in Far Cry 6. Even the new Call of Duty Black Ops 6 hits a 41% increase compared to Intel's Core Ultra 9 285K. The Ryzen 7 9800X3D is undoubtedly tempting for any serious PC gamers. I know I've had my eye on the new chip since rumors began, and based on the positive reviews I plan on putting together a PC upgrade plan. • Best Xbox/PC headsets• Best Windows laptops• Best laptops w/ num pads• Best Xbox storage• Best sim racing PCs• Best ROG Ally accessories• Best gaming laptops I'm coming from a Ryzen 7 5800X chip, which is now a few generations old. In fact, it's using an older AM4 motherboard socket and DDR4 RAM, which means I'll need to upgrade the motherboard and memory when I make the chip change. If you're working with a Ryzen 5000 chip, you'll need to do the same. Whether or not that makes financial sense right now only you can say. If you are looking to upgrade to the new Zen 5 chip, have a look at top motherboards for the Ryzen 7 9800X3D to get you started. If you're already working with a Ryzen 7 7800X3D, chances are you don't see much need to upgrade to the 9800X3D. Your upgrade path will be easier due to the 7800X3D using the AM5 socket and DDR5 RAM, but the $479 MSRP for the 9800X3D no doubt seems a bit steep when your 7800X3D is still so potent. Here's a quick look at the Ryzen 9800X3D and 7800X3D specifications. The Ryzen 7 9800X3D is now available for purchase at major online retailers like Best Buy, Newegg, B&H, and Amazon. You're looking at the same $479 launch price across retailers, and that's expected to stick for the time being. It's always within the realm of possibility that the new CPU will drop in price for Black Friday or Cyber Monday if there's any stock left to discount. If you're buying at launch, here are the retailers currently offering the chip at $479. I'm expecting to see plenty of pre-built gaming PCs have the Ryzen 7 9800X3D as a centerpiece, but at the time of the chip's launch, your options are limited. With the standalone CPUs now sold out everywhere I look, a pre-built might be your next best option. I first spotted a couple of custom PCs from iBuyPower. There are set models starting at $2,099, but you can configure them with a ton of different hardware centered around the Ryzen 7 9800X3D. The lowest price I could configure was $1,346, and there's almost no limit to what you can add if your budget allows. iBuyPower AMD Ryzen X3D Pro A massive collection of configuration options allows you to build your PC from the screws up, and it's all centered around the new AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D CPU. 👉 See at iBuyPower.com CyberPowerPC is so far the only other builder I spotted featuring the Ryzen 7 9800X3D. There are six pre-builts available at the time of writing, each with a different case and liquid cooler. Prices start at $1,685 for the 9800X3D, RTX 4060 Ti GPU, 32GB DDR5 RAM, and 1TB M.2 PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD. 👉 See CyberPowerPC's Ryzen 7 9800X3D pre-built PCs Yes, the predecessor Ryzen 7 7800X3D is still available to buy. It is, however, more expensive now than it was at launch. In some countries, including Canada where I'm located, it's practically impossible to find. That's a testament to its lasting power and popularity. With the best price I can find hovering around $476 at Amazon — or around $570 at Newegg and Walmart — you might as well buy the newer Ryzen 7 9800X3D for about the same price. My recommendation changes if the price of the 7800X3D suddenly drops following the 9800X3D launch. There's also Black Friday and Cyber Monday heading our way in a few weeks, which is usually a great opportunity to save significantly on PC parts and upgrades. AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D AMD's Ryzen 7 7800X3D remains a killer option for gamers, though its popularity has caused prices to spike in the lead-up to the Ryzen 7 9800X3D's launch. If prices should fall below those of the newer chip, I strongly recommend it as an alternative. The best price at the time of writing is at Amazon ($476). 👉 Available at: Amazon | Walmart | Newegg Cale Hunt brings to Windows Central more than eight years of experience writing about laptops, PCs, accessories, games, and beyond.

Nvidia, a leading American software company, reclaims the title of the world’s most valuable company by market capitalization, topping tech giant Apple. The company’s shares jumped by 2.5% during Tuesday’s trading hours, pushing its market valuation to roughly $3.44 trillion, topping Apple’s $3.37 trillion. The world’s most valuable companies, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple, have been contesting the “world’s most valuable company” tag for most of the year. However, Nvidia was the year’s surprise story thanks to its investment in chips that power the Artificial Intelligence technology. Nvidia has been bolstered by the 850% growth in the AI and machine learning space and the growth of AI-based coins. As the company enjoys an increased demand for its chips, other AI coins like the Internet Computer, the NEAR protocol, Bittensor, Injective, and Artificial Superintelligence Alliance have enjoyed their respective surges too. Nvidia overtakes Apple as world’s most valuable company https://t.co/chWMKMofPL pic.twitter.com/Zfqa4PBYcu — CNA (@ChannelNewsAsia) October 25, 2024 Last September 6th, Nvidia’s price was just $102.83 but soon started to climb thanks to increasing demand for its chips. At the heart of its operations are the AI chips that power many large language models today. According to Fall Ainina of James Investment Research, Nvidia’s current position is linked to machine learning and generative AI industry growth. Thanks to its role in advancing AI technology, the company’s stock has increased by over 850% since 2022. The company supplies chips to top tech companies such as Amazon, Alphabet, Meta, and even Microsoft. Analysts expect the company’s revenues to beat the company’s estimates, with an additional 44% growth next year. Nvidia’s impressive performance this year can be attributed to the demand for its chips and the growth in AI coins. For example, there’s NEAR protocol, which jumped by 5.40%. It’s currently priced at $3.81, with over $222 million in 24-hour trading volume. Internet Computer is another AI coin that’s surging, adding 5% to its market value, with a market volume of $57 million. Plenty of AI coins are joining the tech firm’s market rally. Bittensor is now trading at $482, and Artificial Superintelligence is rising to $1.25, reflecting an increase of 10.96%. Nvidia’s growing market cap and the continuing popularity of AI coins highlight AI’s increasing influence. Some of the top Wall Street companies, such as Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, and Alphabet, are now working with the company to expand their AI capabilities. Market analysts expect the company and AI coins to sustain their rally in the short term. As of this writing, Nvidia accounts for 7% of the US S&P 500 Index weight. It’s also crucial to note that AI stocks like Nvidia are some of the performing stocks for the year.

The net worths of many of the world’s wealthiest people skyrocketed Thursday, particularly those with strong ties to cryptocurrency, with stocks soaring following Donald Trump’s election win as the president-elect is expected to embrace cryptocurrency and corporate tax cuts during his upcoming term. Musk is one of Trump's most wealthy backers. (Photo by ANGELA WEISS/AFP via Getty Images) Elon Musk: The Tesla chief, who was one of Trump’s biggest financial backers in the lead-up to the election, experienced a nearly $21 billion jolt to his net worth Wednesday, bringing it to $285.6 billion as Tesla’s stock closed up nearly 15% on Wednesday at $288.53—its highest share price recorded this year. Jeff Bezos: Bezos’ net worth is up $7 billion to $223.5 billion after a strong day of trading for Amazon shares (up 3.8%), maintaining his position as the world’s second-wealthiest person behind Musk. Larry Ellison: The Oracle co-founder is nearly $12 billion richer, as his net worth jumped to $220.8 billion and lessened the gap between him and Bezos for No. 2 on Forbes’ billionaire list. Warren Buffett: The world-renowned investor’s net worth spiked $7.6 billion Wednesday, bringing it to $147.4 billion, with Berkshire Hathaway rising more than 5%. Brian Armstrong: Armstrong, the CEO of crypto platform Coinbase, has an estimated $11 billion net worth after a $2.6 billion increase Wednesday, the result of a whopping 31% surge for Coinbase as it closed at $254.31 (the platform’s co-founder, Fred Ehrsam, became $600 million richer as markets closed). Vlad Tenev & Baiju Bhatt: The Robinhood co-founders’ net worths climbed together, with Bhatt’s up $307 million to $1.9 billion and Tenev’s up nearly $300 million to $1.9 billion, as well (Robinhood shares surged almost 20% Wednesday). Michael Saylor: Saylor, the founder of bitcoin strategy firm MicroStrategy, became nearly $600 million richer as his estimated net worth climbed to $6.6 billion while the company’s stock swelled 13% to $257.81—one of its highest points of the year.

Meta co-founder Mark Zuckerberg did not join in on the rush, as he experienced a small drop in net worth to $197.9 billion and kept his place as the fourth-wealthiest person in the world behind Ellison. Meta shares ended the trading day at $572.05—down $0.38. Bitcoin reached an all-time high Wednesday, skyrocketing past the $76,000 mark in reaction to Trump’s electoral victory. Businesses and crypto-related stocks are likely reacting positively to the election results because Trump has positioned himself as a “crypto president” and promised tax cuts to prominent CEOs including Apple’s Tim Cook and JPMorgan’s Jamie Dimon. Cryptocurrency investors also believe his presidency will be favorable for crypto regulations, as Trump said this year he aims to make the U.S. the “crypto capital of the planet”—a full reversal from the doubts and criticisms he levied at cryptocurrency years ago.

Nvidia is now worth more than Meta and Amazon combined. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The AI hype is in full throttle, as Nvidia is now the largest company in the world by market cap. With a market capitalization of $3.52 trillion, Nvidia has effectively dethroned Apple for the second time this year. This news follows developments in the stock market, with Nvidia's shares surging by 2.72% this morning. All top leaders had a bullish start to the day, but a 0.64% uptick wasn't enough for Apple to hold off the green storm. Nvidia now stands as the world's largest company by market cap, but will it be able to defend its position? If so, for how long? A deeper dive into Nvidia's stock shows that just one year ago, its market cap stood at roughly $1.1 trillion, netting us a 214% increase in the stock price within just 365 days. This is genuinely unprecedented growth, most of which can be attributed to Nvidia's ventures in the AI market as the chipmaker's accelerators continue to fuel the hype train. Q2 24 earnings show that Nvidia's revenue rose by 141% QOQ, increasing to $10.3 billion in data centers, while gaming was a measly 11% at $2.5 billion. With virtually every company planning to get a piece of the AI pie, they still require chips specifically tailored for Artificial Intelligence training and inference. Nvidia's latest Blackwell-based B100 and B200 GPUs are reportedly sold out for the next 12 months. Companies revolving around AI, such as OpenAI, Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, you name it, are all in an arms race to procure the latest chips from Nvidia. AMD's CDNA3-based MI325X and the upcoming CDNA4-based MI355X could shake things up somewhat. For the time being, companies might still be inclined to prefer Nvidia due to its better software stack; however, more competition is good for evsuitablene - even multi-trillion-dollar conglomerates. The question boils down to mass-scale production since data centers and supercomputers require 10,000 to 100,000 GPUs, so it ultimately depends on whether either company can fulfill the required demand within the required time. These have been two very eventful years for not just Nvidia but its CEO, Jensen Huang, who is set to receive an honorary doctorate in engineering. Financially, consumer GPUs seem to be an afterthought for Nvidia, although leaks suggest that Nvidia is eying a January 2025 reveal for the much-anticipated RTX 50 series.

AMD continues the theme with its second generation of 3D V-Cache to deliver unparalleled gaming performance and middling productivity.

It's not a big enough jump to tempt those happy with a previous-gen Ryzen 7 7800X3D, but anyone on Ryzen 5000 chips or jumping ship from Intel will love it if the $30 MSRP hike and AM5 overhauls don't sour the temptation.

I can tell you that extra cores and threads benefit raw productivity performance, but I'll always feel the temptation of a gaming-centric CPU that delivers boosted framerates, something AMD has repeatedly delivered with its -X3D chips. • Price and availability• CPU benchmarks• Gaming benchmarks• Competition• Should you buy? It's a simple fact that consistently proves itself with each processor generation: gamers want the best performance for their money and will take any desktop boosts as a convenient side effect. AMD has remained in the top-seller spot for most CPU retailers, with the previous-generation Ryzen 7 7800X3D sitting pretty as the gaming champion since its release. If that were ever to change, it'd be with a direct successor, and that's the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, here at last. While I've tested processors from both Intel and AMD, my personal PCs have always used AMD Ryzen chips for modern builds and even AMD Athlon 64 many years before that. I've watched them evolve and still choose them for myself. At its launch, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D is the only Zen 5 processor in AMD's Ryzen 9000X3D range. More variants, presumably (but so far unconfirmed) a 9900X3D and 9950X3D, are expected to follow. Price: $479 at Newegg Release: November 7, 2024 Cores: 8 Threads: 16 Base clock: 4.7GHz Max boost: Up to 5.2GHz L3 cache: 96MB Base TDP: 120W The Ryzen 7 9800X3D is an 8-core, 16-thread APU (SoC) running at a 120W base TDP like its predecessor, the Ryzen 7 7800X3D. Its specs are also similar to AMD's Ryzen 7 9700X chip, which runs at a lower TDP with a reduced L3 cache, focused on productivity rather than gaming. Officially launching with a $479 MSRP, which is $30 more expensive than the $449 Ryzen 7 7800X3D it replaces, actual store listings come relatively close with some minor inflation. AMD has moved from a 4nm process to 5nm via TSMC's foundry but remains on the same AM5 socket with compatible 9000X3D motherboards and supports the same CPU coolers as its previous-gen Zen 4 (7000 Series) chips. Upgrading from a Ryzen 7000X3D chip would be a straightforward process for enthusiasts. Still, it wouldn't provide as much of a performance leap as it would for those using a Ryzen 7 5800X3D or similar AM4 variants using now-incompatible DDR4 memory modules (RAM) as AM5 requires DDR5. Having previously tested AMD's Ryzen 7 7800X3D and Ryzen 8000 Series processors like the Ryzen 5 8600G and Ryzen 7 8700G, I already had access to a compatible AM5-socket motherboard with the ASUS ROG STRIX B650-A Gaming WiFi. However, AMD provided all-new samples to ensure compatibility with the latest BIOS software and EXPO-compatible RAM running at 6000MHz. Arctic sent its Liquid Freezer III 360mm AIO to help test a separate processor, but it still offers the best cooling performance here. This review was made possible with review samples provided by G.SKILL, Samsung, and MSI via AMD alongside Arctic. The companies did not see the contents of the review before publishing. No matter what a processor was designed for, it always passes my usual gamut of synthetic benchmarks that test single-core and multi-core performance in various productivity tasks. As fun as it would be to skip right to the gaming tests, it's important to see where the Ryzen 7 9800X3D ranks among its peers in burst processing and longer, sustained stress tests. For burst processing tests in Geekbench 6, the 9800X3D scores above its lower-powered non-X3D sibling, the $359 Ryzen 7 9700X, in multi-core performance but below in single-core equivalents. In synthetic productivity benchmarks, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D performed around 21-22% faster than its predecessor, the 7800X3D. Of particular note is how far ahead Intel's $589 Core Ultra 9 285K pulls in multi-core tests, as by design, but there isn't much of a gap in the single-core category — remember this when I compare gaming performance next. Otherwise, there's about a 22% generational burst performance improvement over AMD's predecessor, the Ryzen 7 7800X3D. Sustained stress tests with Cinebench 2024 show a similar story, with the 9800X3D scoring slightly ahead of the Ryzen 7 9700X as before while creeping on the heels of Intel's $309 Core Ultra 5 245K. In the long run, single-core performance falls in favor of Intel, with more of a lead gained by the Core Ultra 9 285K as it once again places miles ahead in multi-core equivalents, dominating productivity by a colossal degree. Again, a 21% generational sustained performance over the 7800X3D matches the burst tests. In its official documentation for the Ryzen 7 9800X3D, AMD touts an average 8% performance improvement in gaming compared to the previous-gen Ryzen 7 7800X3D. The amount depends on a range of engine-specific quirks that determine how CPU-bound or GPU-bound a title can be, though the percentage gap usually increases over time with post-launch driver updates. Nevertheless, the 7800X3D, until now, was the best gaming CPU available, so these improvements are no real surprise — so, it's far more interesting to compare the 9800X3D against Intel's top-end CPU: the Core Ultra 9 285K. While writing my Intel Core Ultra 9 285K review, no graphical setting changes would significantly increase my FPS in Forza Horizon 5. While it's likely a bug, this chart accurately represents the best framerate I can achieve at this time with the 'High' preset at 1080p. Matching estimations, Black Myth: Wukong scores almost identically on AMD's Ryzen 7 9800X3D and Intel's Core Ultra 9 285K, while the "121.9%" gains promised in the CPU-centric title Ashes of the Singularity: Escalation didn't manifest in my testing, sticking around 6% instead. While not much of a surprise given its excellent performance on practically any hardware, Forza Horizon 5 scores an outrageous average of 387 FPS, which is perfect for anyone who uses those 360Hz 1080p gaming monitors. However, something clearly is bugged on Intel's side, so I'm skipping the implied percentage gain for Forza. Moving from a disastrous launch to a patched-up marvel, Cyberpunk 2077 sees a 52% performance increase on the 9800X3D over Intel's Core Ultra 9 285K, proving far better of a pairing to NVIDIA's current high-end GeForce RTX 4090 graphics card. Far Cry 6 bumps up performance by 43% with the same GPU and DDR5-6000 RAM pairing, and the latest blockbuster Call of Duty entry enjoys a 41% lead as the 9800X3D earns extra frames in Black Ops 6. So, while I'm testing a tighter scope of popular AAA titles on PC, I still saw around a 36% performance increase in gaming with the Ryzen 7 9800X3D. Naturally, my number would be lower if I only tested games closer to the 100% to 110% range of AMD's generational game performance chart, but seeing visually-rich megahits like Call of Duty and Cyberpunk 2077 score such significant increases is reassuring for the performance of a brand-new processor at day one. Yes, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D is the best gaming CPU you can buy, taking over from its predecessor, the Ryzen 7 7800X3D. 96MB of second-generation 3D V-Cache in the Zen 5 architecture helps push for higher FPS (frames per second) in games than Intel's top-end Core Ultra 9 285K, a rival processor that features more cores and threads, a higher clock speed, and slightly higher TDP. Ultimately, Intel's more expensive CPU offers better multi-core performance in productivity tasks and synthetic benchmarks, but AMD wins in gaming performance. The Ryzen 7 9800X3D has three significant competitors, though only two would be taken seriously by anyone on a budget. Internally, Intel's Core Ultra 9 285K stands against AMD's gaming CPU simply because it's the most powerful chip in the latest Core Ultra Series 200S range. However, this 24-core, 24-thread carries a price tag of around $589 to $630 and targets an entirely different audience who prioritizes energy efficiency within a productivity-centric software suite. Gaming performance on Intel's side remains relatively unchanged from its last-gen Core i9-14900K, which offered similar performance to its i9-13900K predecessor and suffered from an overarching microcode launch bug that was later fixed for the continued manufacturing of 14th Gen chips. Still, listings for the Core i9-14900K sit around $440 as AMD's Ryzen 9800X3D is ready to launch, making it an attractive option since some of its best motherboards support an established LGA 1700 socket with wide DDR4 and DDR5 RAM support, bringing down the overall cost of a custom build. The other major competitor is a call from inside Team Red's house, as the AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D doesn't fall far enough behind the new 9800X3D to warrant an upgrade from anyone who already has one. On the other hand, those who already adopted the AM5 socket with all-new motherboards and DDR5 RAM could happily swap out their processor for this new replacement without buying any extra components, but dropping almost $500 on an 8-22% potential performance gain isn't so tempting. So, the Ryzen 7 9800X3D stands as a more logical upgrade path for those using a Ryzen 7 5800X3D from 2022. Still, this lumps users with the mandatory motherboard and RAM upgrades, though most AM4-compatible CPU coolers will work with AM5 replacements, so it's not entirely damaging to your budget. The bright side is that you'll feel a more significant boost if you upgrade from the 5800X3D, with compatibility for PCIe 5.0 (Gen 5), unlocking faster storage options with the CPU bump. Overall, it's a sticky situation because the only people who will see the most significant benefits are the ones doomed to spend extra cash on a total rig overhaul. ✅ You want the absolute best gaming CPU on the market. ✅ You crave the highest framerate count possible for high-FPS gameplay. ❌ You're already using a Ryzen 7 7800X3D or high-end 14th Gen Core i9. ❌ You rely on productivity apps that demand the best multi-core performance. Make no mistake: the Ryzen 7 9800X3D is the best gaming CPU, politely dethroning its predecessor as the new king of the hill as a cache-heavy monster. However, it's not winning any awards for productivity. It isn't worth installing into a PC that spends most of its time crunching numbers in Microsoft Office and Teams since the 9900X and 9950X dominate that category, but it's a far better pick for gamers than anything from Intel's modern productivity-centric offerings. Unfortunately, those who'll benefit most will need to spend a sizeable amount of cash on a new motherboard and RAM upgrades, making the 9800X3D MSRP hike sting a little more than a cute $30. Nevertheless, this is the new meta for PC gaming, and nothing else can challenge its ability to deliver monstrous FPS counts if you can pair it with a capable GPU to enjoy the latest AAA titles loaded with visual luxuries. The Ryzen 7 9800X3D is a hot pick for those willing to upgrade, taking over from the 7800X3D as the best gaming CPU and beating Intel's top offering.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Trump Media & Technology Group stock (DJT) surged as much as 25% before paring gains in after-hours trading on Tuesday as investors brace for more wild swings with Donald Trump edging ahead of Kamala Harris in the latest election results. All states have now closed their respective polling stations. So far, Trump has secured 248 electoral college votes, while Harris has claimed 214, according to the Associated Press. The stock had a wild session during market hours on Tuesday as trading was halted several times due to volatility, with shares quickly erasing 15% gains and reversing Monday's double-digit percentage rise to kick off the week. Despite a recovery from steeper losses, shares still closed down a little over 1%. The latest price action comes as investors await the results of the presidential election between the Republican nominee and his challenger. Volatility in the stock is expected to continue as strategists categorize the stock as a binary bet on the election. Matthew Tuttle, CEO of investment fund Tuttle Capital Management, recently told Yahoo Finance's Catalysts that the trajectory of shares hinges on "a buy the rumor, sell the fact" trading strategy. Read more: Trump vs. Harris: 4 ways the next president could impact your bank accounts "I would imagine that the day after him winning, you'd see this come down," he surmised. "If he loses, I think it goes to zero." Interactive Brokers' chief strategist Steve Sosnick said DJT has taken on a meme-stock "life of its own." "It was volatile on the way up, and when a stock is that volatile in one direction, it has a tendency to be that volatile in the other direction," he said on a call with Yahoo Finance last week. In September, shares in the company — the home of the Republican nominee's social media platform, Truth Social — traded at its lowest level since the company's debut following the expiration of its highly publicized lockup period. Shares had bounced back from their lows, though, as both domestic and overseas betting markets shifted in favor of a Trump victory. Trump founded Truth Social after he was kicked off major social media apps like Facebook (META) and Twitter, now X, following the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riots. Trump has since been reinstated on those platforms. He officially returned to posting on X in mid-August after about a year's hiatus. As Truth Social attempts to take on social media incumbents, the fundamentals of the company have long been in question. On Tuesday, DJT dropped third quarter results after the market close that revealed a net loss of $19.25 million for the quarter ending Sept. 30. This was narrower than the $26.03 million the company reported in the year-ago period. DJT also reported revenue of $1.01 million, a slight year-over-year drop compared to the $1.07 million it reported in the third quarter of 2023. Over the past nine months ending Sept. 30, revenue has fallen 23% from the prior-year period. Last month, the company revealed that its COO had stepped down in September. Trump maintains a roughly 60% interest in DJT, making his share worth billions. Alexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Title: Should You Pick META Stock At $560?

AUSTIN, TEXAS - SEPTEMBER 18: In this photo illustration, the Instagram logo is displayed on a ... [+] computer screen on September 18, 2024 in Austin, Texas. (Photo illustration by Brandon Bell/Getty Images) Meta stock (NASDAQ: META) has seen a 3% fall in a week, while it’s up around 60% this year. The company recently reported its Q3 results, which were better than the street estimates. Its top line stood at $40.6 billion and the bottom line at $6.03, compared to the consensus estimates of $40.2 billion and $5.25, respectively. Despite a beat, the stock didn’t see any gains, as investors were concerned about higher costs. Let’s dive deeper into the company’s quarterly performance and its impact on META stock. Also, look at what’s happening with Google stock. Meta Platforms’ revenues of $40.6 billion in Q3 reflected a 19% y-o-y rise, driven by a 7% rise in ad impressions and an 11% growth in average price per ad. Meta also reported a 5% rise in family daily active people to 3.29 billion. Most of the company’s revenue came from ad sales on Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp. The company is benefiting from its AI push, targeting more advertising. The company plans to use AI to generate more content. Not only did the company post higher revenues, its operating margin expanded to 43%, up around 300 bps y-o-y. Higher revenues and margin expansion resulted in earnings of $6.03 per share, up 37% y-o-y. Looking forward, Meta expects its Q4 revenue to be in the range of $45 billion to $48 billion. What didn’t sit well with the investors was the company’s hike in capital spending guidance to $38 billion to $40 billion and higher investments in 2025 as well. This compares with $27 billion Meta spent in capital expenditures in 2023. Much of the new investments are related to the company’s AI push involving data centers and related infrastructure. META stock, with 60% gains this year, has outperformed some of the other large tech stocks, including GOOG, up 21%, AMZN, up 28%, and MSFT, up 9%. However, we think META stock is appropriately priced now. We estimate Meta Platforms’ valuation to be $560 per share, aligning with its current levels. At $560, META stock is already trading at 25x expected earnings of $22.65 in 2024, compared to the stock’s average P/E ratio of 17x over the last three years. A rise in valuation multiple for META makes sense given the solid advertising growth lately. However, continued aggressive investments into AI also poses a slight risk if it would eventually provide a meaningful boost to the company’s earnings growth. For now, the story for most of the tech stocks is about valuation multiples. Some of them are trading at levels higher than seen over recent years. Although META stock has seen a 2x rise since 2021, the increase has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 23% in 2021, -64% in 2022, and 194% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. While META stock looks appropriately priced, it is helpful to see how Meta’s Peers fare on metrics that matter.

Title: Vornado Reports Strong Office Leasing as NYU Master Leases 770 Broadway

Time Published: 2024-11-05T18:40:41Z
Full Content:
© 2024 Observer Media · Terms · Privacy Steven Roth’s Vornado Realty Trust (VNO) reported lower cash flow in the third quarter of 2024 than it generated in the previous year’s third quarter, but the real estate investment trust emphasized its improving office leasing numbers — with New York University agreeing to master lease 1.1 million square feet at 770 Broadway — with high rents as it winds down the year. During Tuesday’s third quarter earnings call, Vornado reported funds from operations reached $99.25 million in the third quarter of 2024, down from $119.48 in the previous year’s third quarter. Moreover, funds from operations for the first nine months of the year hit $352.9 million, down from $382.5 million compared to the first nine months of 2023. The firm’s dividend to shareholders in the third quarter ended at 52 cents per diluted share, less than 66 cents per diluted share in the third quarter of 2023. Roth struck a confident and defiant tone when reporting the firm’s financials, and said that Vornado expects to pay a dividend of 68 cents per share to shareholders at the end of the year in order to conserve cash. In 2023, Vornado suspended dividend payments beginning in April of that year. “While our business is financially better and improving, we’ll continue to be rigorous with cash management,” he said. “This strategy has been understood and is endorsed by our major shareholders. I expect as conditions normalize, so will our dividend.” Vornado president and chief financial officer Michael J. Franco said that the quarter’s financial results were expected to be down from the previous year due to “items previously forecasted,” notably recent vacancies at several Manhattan office properties. “This decrease was primarily attributable to lower [net-operating income] from known move-outs, largely at 770 Broadway, 1290 Avenue of the Americas, 280 Park Avenue, and higher net interest expenses, both of which we have previously discussed,” said Franco. Those move-outs included Facebook parent company meta dropping 275,000 square feet at 770 Broadway when its lease expires this year. However, Vornado got a break as it announced Tuesday that NYU agreed to master-lease the entire 1.1 million-square-foot office portion of the Broadway building. But both Roth and Franco pointed to encouraging leasing and occupancy numbers to make the case that the REIT’s office-heavy business model has finally turned the corner after several years of post-COVID uncertainty. Roth reported that year-to-date leasing reached 2.5 million square-feet company-wide, including 2.1 million square feet in Manhattan. He said that he’s confident the firm will reach between 3.5 million and 3.8 million square feet of leases in Manhattan by the end of the year, which would be the second-highest annual amount in the firm’s history, with “the highest starting rents ever.” “Activity is robust,” said Roth. “No new supply always begets a landlord’s market. Our rents are going up, I’m extremely optimistic, and the stock market seems to agree.” Vornado’s stock price opened at $42.81 on Tuesday, up from the $22.88 it sat at on Nov. 6, 2023. Aside from the NYU deal, Roth and Franco highlighted several other large leasing transactions in the firm’s Manhattan portfolio. Vornado leased 740,000 square feet of office space in the third quarter, including 297,000 square feet that Google renewed at 85 10th Avenue and leasing totals of 70,000 square feet of space at Penn 1, with an average starting rent of $119 per square foot. The NYU deal at 770 Broadway includes an upfront payment of prepaid rent that will allow Vornado to pay off its $700 million loan on the property, according to Roth. All told, the firm leased 2 million square feet in New York City across 68 transactions in the first nine months of 2024, with average starting rent of $112 per square foot, according to Franco. “The tide has clearly shifted in the New York, Class-A office market: leasing activity is strong and gaining momentum and availability are declining, particularly for large blocks of space,” said Franco. Vornado reported office occupancy of 87.5 percent in the third quarter, down from 89.3 percent in the previous quarter. Franco blamed the expiration of Meta’s lease at 770 Broadway for the small decline, but stated that the NYU master lease at the same office building will bring the firm’s office occupancy up to 90.8 percent by January. He also said vacant space at the newly opened Penn 2 has impacted occupancy levels, but that will also only be temporary. “The easiest money we can make is filling up our empties. As occupancy rises, earnings will go up,” he said. “Our office occupancy will likely decrease in the first quarter 2025, and as vacant space at Penn 2 is placed into service, we anticipate that this decrease will be temporary, and as Penn 2 stabilizes we get to 93 [percent occupancy].” Vornado also announced its portfolio’s retail occupancy rates stand at 78 percent, but Roth argued that excluding Manhattan mall vacancies brings the firm’s retail occupancy closer to 90 percent. “So, actually, we’re pretty well leased in above-the-market occupancies,” he said. “There is strong demand in retail and retail is certainly in much better shape than it was a couple of years ago.” The firm said it carries liquidity of $2.6 billion, with $1 billion cash on its balance sheet. “We are in a very strong capital position,” said Roth. “Our single focus is in creating value, being financially disciplined, and getting our stock price up to where we think the value is and where it should be. “In order to do that, we need to keep leasing, keep improving our balance sheet, and cutting out assets we don’t want, turning them into cash, and continue to work on the very significant and great asset pool we currently have,” he added. “But, actually, I’m all about the stock price.” Brian Pascus can be reached at bpascus@commercialobserver.com.

Title: What's Happening With Google Stock?

Time Published: 2024-11-05T12:00:00Z

Google logo sign is seen outiside Google office in Krakow, Poland on October 19th, 2024. (Photo by ... [+] Beata Zawrzel/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Alphabet stock (NASDAQ: GOOG) saw a marginal growth of over 1% last week, despite it reporting a solid quarter. The company reported revenue of $88.3 billion and earnings of $2.12 per share, both metrics well above the consensus estimates of $86.3 billion and $1.85, respectively. The increased demand for AI solutions drove the growth for the company. However, much of the positives appears to be priced in for its stock. In this note, we discuss the key takeaways from Alphabet’s results, its stock performance, and valuation. Also, check out should you Buy, Sell, Or Hold Amazon? Google’s revenues of $88.3 billion in Q3 reflected a 15% y-o-y gain. The growth was led by its cloud business, with segment sales up a solid 35% to $11.4 billion. Google search revenue was up 12% to $49.4 billion, and YouTube ad revenue was also up 12% to $8.9 billion y-o-y. The company’s self-driving car unit — Waymo — is now seeing 150,000 weekly paid rides. Waymo could be the next big thing for Google. See how Waymo could be worth $5 trillion. Not only did Alphabet see its revenue rise, its operating margin expanded 450 bps y-o-y to 32.3% in Q3. Higher revenue and margin expansion led to a 37% rise in the bottom line to $2.12 per share. Looking forward, we expect the company to post revenue of $96 billion in Q4, and earnings to be around $2.15 per share. While Alphabet’s results were solid, its stock price appears to have little room for growth, in our view. We estimate Google’s valuation to be $182 per share, reflecting only 6% upside from its current levels of over $170. Our forecast is based on 23x expected earnings of $8.05 per share in 2024. The 23x figure is higher than the stock average P/E ratio of 18x seen over the last three years. GOOG stock is trading at a multiple lower than some of its peers, with META trading at 26x and AMZN at 40x forward expected earnings. That is because there remains a key risk for Alphabet. Google is facing antitrust cases, alleging the company to monopolize the marketplace and the general search services. The remedies could include a breakup of the company, which seems unlikely for now, regulatory oversight, and restrictions on businesses, among others. None of these would bode well for Alphabet’s businesses in the long term. As such, despite a strong growth visibility in the cloud business, on the back of AI demand, and continued ad revenue gains, we think that the stock may not see any meaningful growth in the near term. GOOG stock has seen over 20% gains this year, broadly aligning with the returns for the S&P500 index. However, the change in GOOG stock over the recent years has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for GOOG stock were 65% in 2021, -39% in 2022, and 59% in 2023. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. While GOOG stock looks like it has little room for growth, it is helpful to see how Google’s Peers fare on metrics that matter.

Title: Will Wall Street allow Big Tech to make AI work?

Artificial intelligence (AI) is taking over – at least when it comes to the stock market and investors. In the past few months, we have seen the value of chip companies that have positioned themselves in the AI sector soar. Nvidia has overtaken Intel, a situation that might once have been unthinkable. Newcomers such as OpenAI and Anthropic have been making inroads into the market, attracting significant valuations from investors. And it seems that anyone who is anyone is getting involved in AI in some way. If there was any doubt that AI was attracting big money, a look at the most recent round of quarterly results should have put that to bed. Last week, several of the largest tech companies – Meta, Google, Microsoft, AWS – revealed increased spending on the technology as they each try to capitalise on the interest in AI. But there is more to come. Big tech companies are planning to spend even more in building their AI arsenal into next year, and hoping to persuade customers to adopt it at scale. The question is, will Wall Street give them the space to do it? Lest we forget, it is not too long ago that the same companies that are investing heavily in their AI capabilities were telling their staff that they needed to cut their cloth to fit the new economic reality, at the mercy of fluctuating share price. That new economic reality seems to include the shiny new AI toys, for which tech companies seem prepared to offer deep budgets. If the promise of AI is realised, then the billions ploughed into developing the technology will be seen as a sensible investment. But if not, it won’t be the first time that a much-hyped new technology fails to live up to the forecasts. Fully autonomous cars, which have been in development for years, have yet to reach any sort of meaningful market. NFTs promising a new wave of artists revenue, selling for outrageous sums, have fallen out of favour. And lets not forget the world of crypto. For now, Wall Street is watching, nervously. If there is a hint of the technology not reaching its potential, the money that has flowed in to AI companies could just as quickly flow out.

That was the conclusion of the S&P Dow Jones committee, which decides when changes need to be made to the 30-member index, long viewed as a key barometer of the U.S. economy. After markets closed on Friday, S&P said Intel is out. It's being replaced, on Nov. 8, by rival chipmaker Nvidia, which has ballooned to become the world's second most-valuable public company, just a hair behind Apple as of Monday. With the change, four of the tech industry's six trillion-dollar companies will be in the Dow, with internet giants Alphabet and Meta still on the outside. For those two companies, there are no obvious members to replace. Nvidia, on the other hand, recently leapfrogged Intel as the biggest chipmaker by revenue, creating a clear one-for-one swap opportunity. A defining characteristic of the Dow is that it's a price-weighted index. That means a stock's significance is based on its price and not the market cap of the company. In getting trounced by Nvidia in artificial intelligence while also losing share of its core PC and data center processor market, Intel has seen its stock price plummet by more than half this year, closing on Friday at $23.20. Now, Intel is by far the least-significant member of the Dow, with a weighting of less than 0.5%. The next lowest-priced stock is Verizon at around $41. With Intel being the only chipmaker in the index, the sector is underrepresented relative to its position in the economy. "A big part of the decision is that semis weren't being represented," Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, said in an interview. "Sector representation and price is important." Nvidia's stock works in the company's favor. On a market cap basis, Nvidia would be worth an outsized 18% of the index, but its stock price will give it just the 21st highest weighting, behind Chevron and ahead of 3M. Nvidia positioned itself to join the Dow in May, when the company announced a 10-for-1 stock split. Silverblatt said the technology industry's weighting in the Dow will go up to about 19.5% from 18.9%, even though its market weight will be at around 58%. The bigger weighting change comes with Sherwin-Williams joining the index at the same time and replacing Dow Inc., bringing the materials sector to about 5% from less than 1%, Silverblatt said. As for Alphabet and Meta, the wait could continue for a long while. Amazon joined the Dow in January, giving the internet sector greater representation in the index. Alphabet's position is slightly complicated by the fact that its Class A and Class C stocks are both publicly traded. Meta's price of almost $562 would currently give it the heftiest weighting in the Dow, just ahead of UnitedHealth Group. Given tech's heightened overall representation, there are no obvious moves ahead that would include Silicon Valley's megacaps. "In order to put one in, you have to take one out," Silverblatt said.

Title: Securities disclosure over Cambridge Analytica data breach comes before court
URL: https://www.scotusblog.com/2024/11/securities-disclosure-over-cambridge-analytica-data-breach-comes-before-court/
Time Published: 2024-11-04T20:36:19Z
Full Content:
The justices will return to securities law on Wednesday with arguments in a case arising out of the 2015 Cambridge Analytica-Facebook data breach. The tech giant’s effort to fend off federal securities fraud lawsuits in Facebook v. Amalgamated Bank could narrow the opportunities for private investors to hold companies accountable under federal laws that regulate corporate misconduct. In 2016, the British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica exploited the data of over 30 million Facebook users in connection with Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign. After Facebook (now Meta) knew of the breach, but before Cambridge’s widespread use of the data was made public, Facebook issued a securities filing disclosing to investors the hypothetical risk that a security breach might cause harm to Facebook’s business and stock price. That disclosure did not reveal that, as Facebook was aware, a large breach of that sort already had occurred. Later, when Cambridge’s misuse of the data became widely known, Facebook’s stock price fell precipitously. The Securities and Exchange Commission and Facebook shareholders sued the company for securities fraud, arguing that the disclosures about the risk of a securities breach were misleading because they did not reveal what Facebook knew about the Cambridge breach. A federal district court dismissed their claims, holding that the risk statements were not false or misleading. But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit reversed, prompting Facebook to come to the Supreme Court. This is one of those cases – regrettably common – where the parties spend as much of their time bickering about what question is properly before the justices as they do presenting their arguments on the merits. Paring away the contentions about what was and was not argued below and whose position has changed the most over the course of the proceeding, Facebook’s central point is that its disclosure about the hypothetical possibility that a data breach could cause it harm in the future is not misleading, and that the lower court erred in its contrary finding. Specifically, Facebook argues that this kind of disclosure – a forward-looking statement about future risks – should never be regarded as misleading solely because it fails to disclose that the relevant triggering event (in this case, a securities breach) already has occurred and well might cause harm to the company. Here, because nothing in the disclosure was incorrect – it is in fact true that a security breach could harm Facebook and its stock price, as history now teaches us. In short, the company says, Facebook cannot be held liable for what it did not say. The investors reject Facebook’s argument as seeking a categorical rule that gives companies a pass if they make a clearly misleading statement and put it in a forward-looking risk disclosure as opposed to some other part of their filing. From the investors’ perspective, the rule should be the same here as anywhere else; the only relevant question is whether the statement, taken in context, was materially misleading. The only thing that the lower courts held here is that Facebook can be liable if the statement, in context, was materially misleading. The investors, a bank and a public pension plan, are seeking compensation for the lost value of their stock. My guess is that the justices will be frustrated by how little the issues on which the parties discuss in their briefs resemble the question they agreed to review. In an effort to offer something predictive about what we might see at the argument, I would point to two things. The first is a deep-seated skepticism of securities fraud litigation held by some of the justices, who tend to view litigation in this area as akin to extortion based on hindsight. The court has also issued a number of decisions in recent years in favor of corporate interests that have weakened federal regulators, including at the Securities and Exchange Commission. On the other hand, it is a powerful benefit to the investors that the government filed a parallel suit against Facebook, contending that its disclosures about security breaches were insufficient; the government appears in full support of the investors and will share in their oral argument time. It similarly helps the investors that there is a forceful and direct friend-of-the-court brief signed by most of the most famous securities law scholars, arguing that the securities laws bar any kind of categorical exception for misleading statements made in forward-looking risk disclosures.

Title: World stocks tread water ahead of crunch US election

European and US stocks fell flat on Monday as investors treaded carefully before the US presidential election that will impact the world economy, with a US Federal Reserve interest rate cut also expected later in the week. In the US presidential race, Democratic candidate Kamala Harris and Republican candidate Donald Trump remain virtually tied in opinion polls ahead of Tuesday’s vote. It might not be clear who has won for days after voting ends. Mr Trump’s policies on immigration, tax cuts and tariffs may put upward pressure on inflation, bond yields and the dollar, analysts believe, while Harris is seen as the continuity candidate. “We are too evenly divided and polarised to suggest a red sweep,” Frank Luntz, Republican consultant and pollster, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum. “The Senate looks like it will swing Republican, but the presidency and the house are simply too close to call,” he said. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe added 0.3 per cent , while the dollar index, which measures the US currency against a basket of currencies, eased 0.29 per cent to 103.63. Iseq heavyweight Ryanair traded flat (remaining at €18) despite a court ruling pausing the effects of a Dublin Airport passenger cap that was due to imminently affect airlines’ access to take-off and landing slots over the summer 2025 period. The airline along with rival Aer Lingus last week brought an urgent application over the Irish Aviation Authority’s (IAA’s) decision to limit passenger numbers to 25.2 million for the period. Most of the other big players on the exchange AIB, Kingspan, Kerry and Glanbia ended the session in the red as investors awaited bigger news later in the week. Permanent TSB and hotel group Dalata were among the few shares to advance. European stocks retreated on Monday as caution over the imminent US presidential election weighed on the regional benchmark, though losses were kept in check by buoyant banking and energy shares. M&A speculation, especially in the luxury goods sector, sparked some sizable moves. EssilorLuxottica popped higher on renewed chatter that Meta Platforms is weighing a stake in the eyewear manufacturer. Elsewhere, Schneider Electric shares slipped after the French electric equipment maker named Olivier Blum as chief executive officer, just days after the group was among companies fined by French antitrust regulators over a price-fixing pact. European equities have drifted lower over the past month or so as investors brace for multiple risk events, including this week’s US presidential election, as well as interest rate decisions from both the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England. The UK’s benchmark FTSE 100 rose marginally on Monday, helped by energy shares, while cautious investors braced for the U.S. presidential election and a potential interest rate cut by the Bank of England (BoE) later this week. The blue-chip FTSE 100 was up 0.1 per cent at 8,184.24 points, while the mid-cap FTSE 250 dipped 0.1 per cent. The heavyweight oil and gas sector rose 0.7 per cent as oil prices jumped more than 2 per cent after a decision by OPEC+ to delay increasing output by a month. The personal goods sector, however, led sectoral gains, driven by an 4.8 per cent jump in Burberry after a report that Italy’s Moncler was considering a bid for the luxury retailer. The banking sector rose 1.1 per cent, supported by Natwest Group that advanced 2.6 per cent to a 13-year high. US stock indexes slipped in choppy trading on Monday, as investors braced for a pivotal week for global markets in which Americans will elect a new president and the Federal Reserve is likely to cut its benchmark policy rate. Some of the so-called “Trump trades” lost ground after a recent poll showed Ms Harris leading in Iowa, triggering a retreat in dollar, bond yields and bitcoin. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 397.83 points, or 0.95 per cent, to 41,654.14,and the S&P 500 lost 27.52 points, or 0.48 per cent, to 5,701.28. Most megacap stocks lost ground, with Tesla dropping 1.8 per cent as the EV maker’s China-made vehicle sales fell in October. However, chip heavyweight Nvidia rose 1.6 per cent, after S&P Dow Jones Indices said on Friday the company would replace Intel in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Intel’s 4.3 per cent slide weighed on the Dow. - Additional reporting by Bloomberg and Reuters Eoin Burke-Kennedy is Economics Correspondent of The Irish Times Get the latest business news and commentary from our expert business team in your inbox every weekday morning © 2024 The Irish Times DAC

Title: Election betting sites pour money into social media ads ahead

Profile Sections tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time While the latest polls suggest that the presidential election may be a close one, some social media advertisements are painting a very different picture. In some ads for the online betting platform Polymarket, graphs illustrate former President Donald Trump’s lead as “up to 32% in the odds” over Vice President Kamala Harris, claiming the service is “the most accurate way to track the election.” What Polymarket isn’t always disclosing alongside the ads, though, is that the displayed percentages are actually odds tabulated based on bets placed with its service, not projections based on representative voter polling. Well over half of the ads don’t mention that the numbers are rooted in prediction-based markets. “The idea is if people disagree with the market price, they have the opportunity to capitalize by buying the side they think is priced too low,” Polymarket CEO Shayne Coplan said in a social media post. Some ads for the platform read, “Don’t trust the polls — trust the markets.” The social media ads have flooded Facebook, Instagram, X and other platforms. On Meta alone, Polymarket has poured at least $50,000 into a campaign including 45 advertisements, which promote the odds, according to data available in Facebook’s ad library. One advertisement — viewed more than 900,000 times on Facebook and Instagram since Oct. 28 — depicts Trump winning in the Polymarket odds, according to the Meta Ad Library. Among the viewers, 20% are men ages 45 to 54 and 12% are women in the same age range. The advertisement was seen the most in California, New York and Texas, with 16%, 11%, and 10% of viewers in those regions, respectively. Several others include questions such as “Did serving fries help Trump’s chances?” or “Does Trump have all the aura?” Of the 45 Meta ads, many include solo images of Trump, some include side-by-side images of both candidates, and none include solo images of Harris. A separate sponsored campaign from the right-wing social media personality Shaneyy Richh included nine advertisements promoting Polymarket forecasts. “The full list of actual conservatives that get polled by political pollsters,” read one ad, which depicted a man squinting at a small piece of paper. “Tired of biased polls? Find out what’s really happening in the 2024 race,” the caption said. On X — owned by one of Trump’s biggest supporters, Elon Musk — advertisements also promoted the predictions on its search page. Polymarket, which offers bets in sports, business, science, politics and more, reports that users have spent more than $2.7 billion placing bets on the next president. According to an X post, one user bet $2.2 million on a Harris win. Based on user bets, Polymarket says Trump’s odds of winning are roughly 65.5% and Harris’ are 34.5% as of Oct. 31. “Odds on Polymarket are derived from the market price of a contract that pays $1 if an event occurs and expires worthless if it doesn’t,” a Polymarket blog post reads. “For example, someone paying 60 cents for a Trump ‘yes’ contract, implies a 60% chance that he wins.” Not all are quick to place bets or even trust Polymarket’s system. “Trump and right-wing influencers are pushing these Polymarket odds as a poll,” Claudio Vallejo, an online creator, said via a TikTok video. “They’re using these odds as proof or evidence that Trump is peaking at the right moment and is so popular that there’s no way he can lose in November. ... They’re laying the groundwork for ‘too big to rig.’” A company spokesperson referred to a “misunderstanding” of the company, explaining the stats are not opinion polls but odds calculated by shares traded on Polymarket. The odds aren’t meant to reflect public opinion; they reflect bettors’ level of confidence in either a Trump win or a Harris win. “A big point of confusion is that both vote share and odds are expressed as a percent, but do not mean the same thing,” Polymarket wrote on its Substack page. Coplan recently took to X to defend the platform as “non-partisan,” calling it a “reality check” meant to “harness the power of free markets to demystify the real world events that matter most to you.” “Polymarket is not about politics,” he wrote in a statement on X on Oct. 25. “This US election cycle, we’ve been pulled onto center stage, as people are fed up with having to make sense of ‘For You’ feeds, pundits, and incongruent polls — we take that responsibility seriously. ... Hopefully politics is the first step to get the masses to realize the value of market-based forecasts.” Though the ads are trending in the U.S., it is prohibited for “U.S. persons,” any citizen or even any temporary resident to take part in the betting, according to Polymarket’s terms. Currently, Polymarket requires bettors to accept terms and conditions confirming they are “not a resident, national, or agent of the United States” or several other countries where the platform is regulated against. In 2022, Polymarket was fined $1.4 million by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which said that it was illegally running events betting in the U.S. A federal appeals court recently overturned the CFTC’s decision to prohibit election betting company Kalshi from limiting “U.S. persons” from placing bets on their markets — but Polymarket wasn’t part of that suit, and the law that prohibits betting on Polymarket is still in place. Kalshi’s stats show a 59% and 41% division between Trump and Harris, respectively. The company has also used social media to promote election betting, spending over $140,000 on Meta ads, according to the company's ad library. While people in the U.S. aren’t supposed to place their own bets, a Polymarket spokesperson said the platform could be useful for Americans because it acts as a live information source similar to the stock market. The social media advertisements don’t explicitly encourage people in the U.S. to bet, but they also don’t include a disclaimer about the regulation. Nevertheless, the site is gaining attention from many right-wing officials and celebrities, including Trump himself. “We’re up in the polls pretty substantially. They have a new phenomenon, and that’s a gambling poll. They call it the poly poll or something I’ve never heard of,” Trump said at a rally in Michigan on Oct. 18, with a crowd member shouting out “Polymarket” to correct him. “Polymarket, and I guess it’s 64 to 38, 36, something like that. So that’s not bad. I don’t know what the hell it means, but it means that we’re doing pretty well,” he added. Though Polymarket called Trump’s reference to the company a “common error” of “confusing Polymarket odds with polls,” a paid advertisement shares the rally clip with the caption: “they call it the pollypoll or something.” The Instagram reel doesn’t include contain any similar clarification as the one on the blog post. Musk also took to X to share the predictions — then 67% and 33.1% for Trump and Harris, respectively. In another post, Musk said Polymarket odds were “more accurate than polls.” A Nov. 3 NBC News poll found Harris and Trump were deadlocked among respondents, each with 49% support from registered voters. Every major poll from the last week shows a split between the candidates from 0 to 3 percentage points, with most differences falling within the margins of error. Some experts warn people to use caution when they analyze both the polls and the markets. “When people look at polls, one is just expecting real precision at a specific moment,” John Fortier, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute focusing on topics such as election demographics and voting, told NBC News last week. “It’s not that we can’t get good information ... but if you’re really expecting polling to tell you ... what’s going to happen next Tuesday absolutely, obviously there’s just built-in margin of error.” Though Fortier said the financial risk associated with markets can be seen as a “more serious” gesture than answers on a poll, he emphasized “real doubts” and warned that “the details matter.” “I just see the possibilities for more market distortion,” he said. “I’m generally skeptical, and then I’m even more skeptical of a market that is narrower but also excludes American citizens.” Sophia Pargas is a news associate for NBC News. © 2024 NBCUniversal Media, LLC

Title: Big Tech is spending eye-watering amounts on AI

Good morning. We’re 24 hours away from Election Day in the United States. Is anyone concerned about someone hacking the vote?According to a recent Pew Research survey of more than 5,000 American adults, the answer depends heavily on a person’s party affiliation.Fifty-two percent of voters are “at least somewhat confident” that U.S. election systems are secure from tech threats like hacking, according to the survey. A whopping 73% of Harris supporters are confident in that security—20 percentage points higher than Biden backers in 2020, no less. Yet a mere 32% of Trump supporters feel similarly, way down from 60% four years ago. A silver lining? Most voters, regardless of party affiliation, believe local poll workers and state election officials will do a good job during the election. Phew. —Andrew NuscaP.S. AT&T CEO John Stankey will discuss the future of U.S. infrastructure at Fortune Global Forum next week, Nov. 11-12 in New York City. Interested? Request an invitation here. Want to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet? Drop a line here. The ROI of AI? Perhaps the single most pressing question in tech outside of who might occupy the Oval Office next year. Now that some of the world’s largest tech companies have shared their latest earnings, it’s clear the question is far from answered. The capital spending of four of the biggest U.S. tech companies—Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft—will likely top $200 billion this year, with little relief planned for 2025. Data centers are materializing. Power agreements are arising. Acquisitions are accelerating. It’s giving gold rush, as the kids say—and Wall Street is a little freaked out that ambitions are outpacing potential returns. (That is: “Delulu.”) On the final day of October trading last week, investors sold off enough tech stock to drive U.S. stock indices down and erase all of the gains they made that month. Microsoft shares dropped 6%, its largest one-day drop in years. Meta shares fell 4%. “This … is maybe not what investors want to hear in the near term, that we’re growing it out,” Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said during a conference call. “But I just think that the opportunities here are really big.” To find solid ground, investors are looking at more tangible components of the revolution, such as semiconductor sales. But concerns remain. For example, even as Microsoft disclosed an annualized $10 billion in AI revenue, it acknowledged that rising costs and slowing growth would eat into its cash cow in the cloud. Funding the revolution might just be more challenging than fomenting it. —AN In the world of blue-chip stocks, one day you’re in, and the next day you’re out. (At least that’s what Heidi Klum might say if she were a day trader.) Nvidia, riding the AI boom that has proven so lucrative for the chipmaker, is set to replace semiconductor peer Intel on the benchmark Dow Jones Industrial Average. The swap will be in place for trading on Friday, Nov. 8. The DJIA, which comprises 30 large companies, is among Wall Street’s oldest indices. It remains a powerful signal of success even if it has been criticized over the years for being too narrow to properly reflect sweeping economic changes. Intel joined the Dow in 1999, the same year as Microsoft; the pair were the first Nasdaq stocks ever chosen for the Dow. (It also happens to be the same year that Nvidia made its IPO for $12 per share. Ah, hindsight.) At the turn of the millennium, IBM and HP complemented the new additions to make four tech components to the Dow; today you’d be hard-pressed to find a firm that wasn’t trying to be in the tech category. —AN Big Tech peers Amazon, Google, and Microsoft have raced to sign agreements with nuclear power plants in a bid to fuel their energy-hungry AI datacenters. On Friday, one of them hit a major hurdle. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission rejected a petition to connect a colocated Amazon Web Services (AWS) data center directly to Talen Energy's Susquehanna nuclear power plant in Berwick, Pennsylvania. The agreement, which would have increased the facility’s load capacity from 300 megawatts to 480 megawatts and diverted power from the regional grid, “could have huge ramifications for both grid reliability and consumer costs,” said Commissioner Mark Christie in a statement. (Talen responded by saying that the decision “will have a chilling effect on economic development.”) The U.S. government and industry seem to be aligned that the development of artificial intelligence is a matter of national security; what’s still to be worked out is who will shoulder the burden. Watch this space. —AN Chinese researchers have created a military AI tool based on Meta’s “open-source” Llama 2 13B large language model, according to Reuters. Meta’s claim that its Llama AI models are “open-source” is hugely controversial, because of its licensing restrictions and the fact that it doesn’t reveal the source of the training data. But that doesn’t change the fact that Meta is making its models available for free, along with the parameters (“weights”) that make it easier to customize them. Per Reuters, that’s what these Chinese researchers have done, creating a model called ChatBIT that can aid military decision-makers and intelligence officers. Meta’s licensing restrictions forbid using Llama in military contexts, but what’s the company going to do? This is sure to inflame the debate over whether “open-source” AI is such a bright idea after all. —David Meyer Ming-Chi Kuo, the TF International Securities analyst known for having a reliable line on Apple’s supply chain, says an affordable Apple Vision Pro is further out than you’d think. “Production of the cheaper Vision Pro has been delayed beyond 2027 for a while now,” he posted Sunday on X, the social media service. “This means Apple's only new head-mounted display device in 2025 will be the Vision Pro with an upgraded M5 processor.” Apple’s $3,500 “spatial computer” was announced in June 2023 and hit the market nine months ago. Though most reviewers found the augmented reality device to be awe-inducing, they just as frequently found it impractical for real-world use. Estimates by IDC in July said Apple would fail to end the year with more than 500,000 units sold. According to Kuo, that’s part of why this delay might be acceptable to Apple. “Simply reducing the price wouldn't help create successful use cases,” he wrote. “It's similar to the HomePod situation—even after launching the cheaper HomePod mini, Apple's smart speakers failed to become mainstream products.” —AN —Elon Musk can’t dismiss ex-Twitter CEO’s severance claim. Parag Agarwal may proceed, a judge rules. —The CHIPS Act hasn’t seen much action. $33b approved; $123m awarded. —Peloton’s new CEO is a Ford and Apple veteran. Two words: Digital services. —Is awkward Alexa-speak not long for this world? Amazon is reorienting its famous assistant around LLMs. —Steve Ballmer wants to improve democracy with data. He spent $40m this year on USAFacts, his not-for-profit civic initiative. © 2024 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: The hour of reckoning in the US, oligarchs applying pressure and making demands, the cabinet reshuffle and Schinas, the tax troubles of Kasselakis’ father with the IRS

Hello, the hour of reckoning has arrived for the new leader of the free world, and naturally, this week, something quite dramatic would need to happen to shift the spotlight from this major event that occurs once every four years and politically, geostrategically, and economically impacts the whole world. Judging by the polls and predictions on both sides, we may find out the winner more than 48 hours after the polls close, though any forecast could simply end up being guesswork. We… – Now, as for us as a country, it doesn’t take a genius to see we’d prefer the Democrats and Kamala, though it’s neither in our hands nor the end of the world if things don’t go that way. After all, there are ties and balances, and our relationship with the U.S. has strengthened more than ever over the past few years, aided by the dynamic presence of Ambassador Tsounis. We shall see. An interesting week is dawning. In Athens… – In Athens, the government is currently occupied with various important, though not earth-shattering, governance issues. Meanwhile, bizarre tales, straight out of Latin America, are coming to light and have become the talk of the town. You might say it’s the old story of “same old, same old” in Greece. Another thing Greece has “always had” – and something this administration, as well as K.M. himself, will also have to deal with – is the wear and tear of a second term. This includes inevitable signs of arrogance, along with increasingly bold and demanding oligarchs and special interests. And naturally, the “regular” folks, whether businesspeople or media tycoons who aren’t asking for money or power, are fewer and fewer and are likely running low on patience. This calls for special caution, because, as we’ve seen before, internal opponents play a role here, and in this instance, some of them are even the same people. For example, Samaras, who toppled Constantine Mitsotakis’ government, wouldn’t hesitate to take down Kyriakos Mitsotakis’ administration if he could. Now, I don’t know if he has enough MPs at his Sunday gatherings, allegedly eating souvlaki and plotting (LOL), or if he could align with Karamanlis’ group, though the Rafina resident is more restrained and less impulsive than Antonis, who some say might even be angling for an interim prime minister role. Though personally, I’m not sure who or what this transition would be for. At any rate, there are eager oligarchs ready to lend support, and let’s not forget the opposition, which now includes Nikos Androulakis, who is flexible and notably open to media support and more. Well, the man is just doing his job, and if he manages to stabilize at 20% or higher, he’ll certainly be playing in the big leagues. Cabinet Reshuffle – Maximos Mansion – Schinas – Thus, the next big topic already buzzing in political offices and business salons around Athens is the upcoming cabinet reshuffle, which will most likely happen after the presidential election, in three months, meaning “wait and see,” especially with K.M., who not only keeps his cards close but also recalibrates based on timing, especially for reshuffles. One juicy tidbit I heard (amid other whispers of people rejoining the government, which has become somewhat cliché) concerns former Commissioner Margaritis Schinas. Rumor has it that Margaritis, now back in his hometown of Thessaloniki, is gearing up for a powerful ministerial position, possibly even as Foreign Minister, replacing Gerapetritis if K.M. decides to bring him back to Maximos Mansion – something that doesn’t seem all that far-fetched. Again, I emphasize that this is just information and not a “guarantee,” as we used to say, since there are still more than three months before any reshuffle. Kasselakis Sr. – Legal Troubles – As for developments in SYRIZA, while we’re all following them, they no longer have that freshness; they’re not “juicy” anymore. Still, here’s an interesting piece of news related to the democracy champion Stefanos. Today, the Council of State (sixth chamber, if I’m not mistaken) is hearing the case of Kasselakis’ father, who famously owes €11.5 million in taxes. This debt stems from an old issue regarding a villa he owned in Ekali, which the SDOE tax investigation agency found was owned by him via an offshore company, leading to significant penalties. Given that the five-member council had upheld prior rulings from lower courts (first-instance and appellate), it’s likely that today’s seven-member council will reach the same conclusion as the previous judges. Nevertheless, he has his day in court, so we wish him “good luck.” Only Two Portfolios Stick to the Business Plan – The red loan market is facing substantial challenges. At the Ministry of Finance, there’s a report by KPMG on the Hercules scheme, which notes that only two NPL portfolios – Frontier and Galaxy in the corporate sector – are progressing according to the business plan. All other portfolios are facing issues ranging from minor to major. Simultaneously, secondary market transactions have slowed down, Intrum has agreed on prices for the sale of seven portfolios but has yet to close the deal, discussions are underway for acquisitions between servicers, even major ones, and the market is generally getting tougher and more demanding. It’s only a matter of time before we see restructuring moves that will lead to stronger entities managing the next phase of red-loan liquidations. PPC enters a new business sector – Establishes “PPC INSPECTRA” – PPC is embarking on a new venture, with its management setting up an independent subsidiary following the operational split of its existing Laboratories, Certification, and Inspection Department (DEPE). The goal of spinning off this division and forming a new company called “PPC INSPECTRA” is to accelerate the expansion of DEPE’s activities (which would be difficult to achieve through organic growth alone) and to penetrate more effectively into the Laboratory Services, Inspection, and Certification (Testing, Inspection & Certification – TIC) market, where demand is high. Strategically, the aim is for the new company to become the preferred TIC provider and offer all the services required by clients in this market (a one-stop shop). Establishing this new subsidiary is the main topic of today’s extraordinary shareholders’ meeting, which is expected to give the green light. Additionally, it’s noted that with the spin-off, DEPE will be able to acquire and integrate other businesses operating in related fields, expand its client base, and grow geographically. This move is favored by the conditions in the Greek TIC market, which is highly fragmented, with the top three companies (Bureau Veritas, DNV, TUV Hellas) collectively holding a 30% market share, while more than 350 smaller firms operate in this space. Notably, DEPE has been part of the former Innovation Center (DKK) and the earlier Center for Testing, Research & Standards (KDEP), and has been providing testing services to PPC’s units and external clients for over 50 years. Since the project is already well underway, DEPE has applied for certification as an Accredited Certification Body from the National Accreditation System (ESYD). The Golden Dividend of… Retired Executives – The Sarantis brothers, Michalis and Takis, might now call themselves “retirees,” having handed over the leadership of the Hellenic Dairies Group (Olympus, Rodopi, Agno, Kliafas, Tyras, etc.) to their children a few months ago. However, they still have a say in strategic decisions and continue to reap the rewards of their years of hard work. This year, they are set to receive a “golden dividend” of nearly 6 million euros. The group is expected to surpass 600 million euros in revenue and 100 million euros in EBITDA this year. In terms of net profitability, based on the decision to distribute dividends, performance is expected to be remarkable, especially when compared to competitors who are now lagging behind. The Rothschild & Co Greece Headache – Rothschild & Co, the prominent investment bank with an expanded presence in Greece in recent years, appears to have a “headache.” Five years ago, it evolved from a simple office into a full-fledged subsidiary called Rothschild & Co Greece S.A. Last year, Marios Broustas was appointed CEO, while the long-time head of the Greek office, Nasos Zabaras, took on the role of Chairman. The subsidiary aims to make a stronger push into the M&A advisory sector, hoping to fulfill the ambitions set by its parent company, as, so far, the balance sheet isn’t exactly thriving. Official reports show a reduced turnover in 2023 of approximately 862,000 euros, with pre-tax losses of 900,000 euros and after-tax losses of 748,000 euros. The company raised its share capital by 2 million euros to reach 2.025 million euros and also received a 1 million euro loan from the parent company via an open credit line. Consequently, its equity turned positive, reaching 726,666 euros, although its working capital (current liabilities minus current assets) remained negative. It’s worth noting that the company has secured a commitment from its ultimate shareholder to provide financial support over the next 12 months to ensure uninterrupted operations. The Surprise – At year’s end, the Ministry of Finance plans a “surprise”: a General State Balance Sheet with almost zero deficit. This means Greece will not only present a primary surplus of 3% to cover interest and debt payments but also a general surplus, having serviced its loans. Many in the Ministry suggest using this surplus to repurchase high-interest loans from the past, thereby dramatically reducing both debt service costs and nominal debt. As major European economies (France, Italy, Spain) dangerously increase their public debt, Greece stands out as a fiscally disciplined economy that reduces its debt and grows at twice the EU average. This is the picture that Finance Minister K. Hatzidakis will present at today’s Eurogroup meeting. The next challenge is for all Greek households to feel this unprecedented fiscal improvement, a goal pursued by the new tax reform bill entering public consultation today. Why They Are Buying EYDAP and EYATH – The government has launched a large-scale water management project with EYDAP leading in the South and EYATH in the North. Inevitably, these major investments and changes will bring new pricing. The implementation has begun, with the new “Regulated Asset Base” (RAB) framework published a month ago, increasing assets by 30% over the current level. Institutional investors are already taking notice, systematically buying shares of EYDAP and EYATH. Despite a declining stock market, EYDAP gained +1.4% last month, reaching a capitalization of 612 million euros with 4,705 trades involving 713,000 shares. EYATH, the “smaller, more conservative” entity, maintains a capitalization of 117 million euros, with 52,316 shares changing hands within the month. Brigadier General Evangelos Mytilineos – Metlen Energy & Metals sponsored the renovation of the 7th Company building at the Hellenic Military Academy. The group’s subsidiary, ELEMKA, fully renovated 2,500 square meters of facilities, upgrading cadet dormitories, common areas, and improving energy efficiency. At the official opening ceremony, President Katerina Sakellaropoulou awarded Evangelos Mytilineos the honorary title of Brigadier General, along with a commemorative statuette and ceremonial sword from the Academy. “Black Friday” Turns Into “Black November” – Traditionally in the U.S., “Black Friday” falls on the last Friday of November, right after Thanksgiving, when retailers clear out old stock at huge discounts to make room for new inventory. In Greece, however, Black Friday has turned into “Black Week” and now “Black November.” Major chains, led by Public, have already started sales, with Kotsovolos announcing a major event at the Mall this week. All stores are launching offers since the usual mid-November sales won’t take place, while retailers aim to secure early holiday spending that consumers will receive in late December. What Buffett Fears—and Expects – Warren Buffett, the “Oracle of Omaha” and renowned contrarian investor, didn’t buy a single stock during the third quarter. As American markets hit record highs and Wall Street experiences a buying frenzy, Berkshire Hathaway has continued to sell stocks, pushing its cash reserves to an unprecedented 325.2 billion dollars. Even with Apple—the market cap leader heading toward 4 trillion dollars—Berkshire has reduced its position, selling 14.3 billion dollars’ worth, leaving its stake at 69.9 billion dollars, or 25% lower than the previous quarter. In total, over the past two quarters, Buffett sold Apple shares worth 100 billion dollars. While selling stocks, Berkshire has simultaneously increased its holdings in U.S. Treasury Bills to 288 billion dollars. Those who view Buffett as a “wise investor” and follow his strategy closely may face a tough week ahead on Wall Street. Not All IT is Golden – Twenty-five years ago, in November 1999, at the peak of the dot-com bubble, Intel was added to the Dow Jones Index as a sign that “IT is the future.” Back then, Intel traded at 42.25 dollars. If someone had invested 10,000 dollars in Intel stock at that time, their investment today would be worth around 5,500 dollars (plus any dividends received). Today, Intel is being removed from the Dow Jones Index, replaced by the well-known Nvidia. Nvidia’s shares have surged +180% this year as tech giants demand its high-powered processors that fuel AI, the technology now seen as the future. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, created by Charles Dow in 1896, is a beacon for the U.S. stock market. Unlike the S&P 500, which weights companies by market capitalization, the 30-stock Dow Jones is price-weighted, meaning higher-priced stocks have more impact. This is why the Dow Jones includes stocks like Apple, Microsoft, IBM, Salesforce, and Cisco Systems, while companies like Google, Amazon, and Meta are absent.
