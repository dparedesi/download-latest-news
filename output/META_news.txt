We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. Nvidia stock (NVDA) jumped as much as 2.7% early Thursday as Wall Street analysts reiterated their Buy ratings on the stock despite concerns about rising competition and the possibility that artificial intelligence chip demand could wane. Over the past few days, Wall Street analysts at Bernstein, TD Cowen, Morgan Stanley, and Truist have maintained bullish outlooks on the company. “All relevant industry contacts support the dominance and superiority of NVDA's full technology stack,” Truist Securities’ William Stein wrote on Monday. He raised his price target on the stock to $204 from $169. Following the nods from Wall Street, Nvidia shares rallied as much as 4.8% Wednesday. But the stock later reversed direction, ending the day down roughly 1%, as stocks fell across the board following commentary from the Federal Reserve projecting fewer rate cuts and stickier inflation in 2025. Even with Thursday's early morning gain, Nvidia stock is still off roughly 11% from its record close of $148.88 in early November. Nvidia shares have fallen as investors worry its GPUs could lose share in the broader AI chip market given that its customers are developing their own custom chips. Google (GOOG) and Meta (META) have developed chips with Broadcom (AVGO). Microsoft (MSFT), Tesla (TSLA), and Amazon (AMZN) also make their own custom chips. Broadcom’s announcement that it’s developing chips for two more clients, who are believed to be ChatGPT-maker OpenAI and Apple (AAPL), boosted the chipmaker’s stock last week and sent Nvidia’s in the opposite direction. These custom chips, called ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits), could potentially threaten Nvidia’s GPUs, given that they are cheaper and tailored to a tech company’s specific AI needs. A Morgan Stanley report released on Dec. 15 showed that custom chips used to run cloud AI services could grow their share of the overall AI chip market from 11% in 2024 to 15% in 2030. Still, Morgan Stanley said, “history is certainly on Nvidia's side” when it comes to maintaining dominance of the AI chip market. “We think ASICs have continued to improve, but Nvidia's strong execution continues to raise the bar for its competitors." It's a point on Nvidia that Bank of America semiconductor analyst Vivek Arya reiterated Wednesday in an episode of the Opening Bid podcast (video above). Additionally, concerns loom that the Big Tech spending on AI chips that fueled Nvidia's rise could slow down. Commentary from Microsoft and Google in their most recent earnings reports indicated that their AI spending will grow at a slower pace in the future. And there are concerns that AI models are no longer improving at their previous breakneck pace, which could also put a damper on investment. TD Cowen analyst Joshua Buchalter said the firm's recent meeting with Nvidia showed the chipmaker is aware of that concern but "remains confident in the industry's ability to progress and continue to innovate." Stein also believes Nvidia will announce a standalone CPU, or central processing unit — the “brain” of a computer, distinct from Nvidia’s Hopper and Blackwell GPUs, or graphics processing units — in 2025, opening up what he sees as a $35 billion market opportunity. Nvidia currently uses its Arm-based Grace CPUs alongside its Blackwell GPUs in servers it sells to customers but does not sell CPUs individually. Laura Bratton is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Title: Dendias and the military camps, the donors and… poor Loukas, the registrar’s anxiety, and the new investor in Athens hotels

Time Published: 2024-12-19T09:32:19Z
Full Content:
Hello there! With the holiday season upon us, it seems the Christmas spirit is spreading, and the idea of goodwill is more prominent than ever. Let me begin with an event that took place yesterday at the Ministry of National Defense. Thanasis Laskaridis and his family laid the foundation for the new building of the Special Cyber Unit of the Hellenic National Defense General Staff (GEETHA), which will be constructed thanks to a donation by the “Athanasios C. Laskaridis Foundation,” named after him. The modest ceremony was attended by Minister Nikos Dendias, Deputy Minister Yiannis Kefalogiannis, the host, GEETHA Chief General Dimitris Choupis, and a select few distinguished guests, including U.S. Ambassador George Tsounis and Chania MP Sevi Voloudaki. Minister Dendias expressed his gratitude for the donation, noting that last year, donations to the Ministry of Defense amounted to €234,000, while this year they soared to €26 million. Interesting, right? But even more striking was the closing remark of the donor, Thanasis Laskaridis, which I’ll quote verbatim: “After all, as the popular song says, dedicated to poor Loukas, we won’t take a single penny to the grave. It’s good, then, for those whom God has blessed with some surplus to do something to help our homeland. It’s time for all of us to get rid of the ‘crabs in our pockets’ and do whatever we can, whatever is necessary.” Dendias’ Commentary and Military Camp Rumors During the same event, Dendias couldn’t avoid questions from those present about the well-known issue (regarding the President of the Republic), jokingly responding, “Well, I’m probably the last person who could comment on this matter,” which, of course, has been settled for a while now—if it was ever truly open. On the other hand, the Minister was much more talkative about efforts to modernize military camps, making sure to throw in a jab about the sparse rumors suggesting that the areas formerly used as camps will be turned into business ventures. “When someone wants to slander another person or initiative, they immediately turn it into a story about interests and that’s the end of it,” he remarked. The Registrar’s Anxiety (Which Has Ended) Over Pavlos Possibly today—or at the latest tomorrow—the former royal family will take action regarding their citizenship. Whether their lawyer will show up, as happened with Michel de Grèce, or Pavlos himself will make an appearance, I can’t say for sure. However, what I can say is that yesterday at the Athens Registry Office, there was quite a commotion, with phones ringing off the hook as employees scrambled to handle all the technical details of the forthcoming request. This was complicated by the fact that certain procedures have been digitized since the Venizelos law. After all, it’s not every day that the former royal family gets added to the records. I hear that written instructions were issued yesterday by the Ministry of the Interior to ensure everything goes smoothly when the request is made. The process is simple: the request is submitted, the Registry Office forwards it to the Ministry of the Interior along with the required documents, and the Ministry determines whether the applicant can be registered or not. That’s what we reported this morning. Eventually, at 11 a.m., it was confirmed that Pavlos and Nikolaos submitted the relevant application at the Athens Registry Office through their proxy lawyer. The surname they chose is “De Grèce,” and a total of 10 members of the former royal family have signed the application. Elections in the Regional Unions It’s a day of decisions for the Union of Greek Regions, as today the successor to Tzitzikostas will be chosen. The role is expected to go to the governor of the South Aegean, Giorgos Hatzimarkos. Following Nikos Hardalias’ announcement that he is withdrawing from the Presidency, the first vice-presidency is set to go to the governor of Crete, Stavros Arnaoutakis, and the second vice-presidency to the governor of the Peloponnese, Dimitris Ptochos. 5% Decrease in Abstention Due to Electoral Roll Cleanup The Ministry of the Interior has received very few applications to reverse deletions from the electoral rolls. This means that in the next national elections, the number of registered voters will be approximately 440,000 fewer. These are individuals aged 80 and above who have had no physical presence in the country or have passed away but had not been removed from the rolls until now due to unreported deaths to the relevant Greek authorities. These individuals contribute to the abstention rates, inflating them by about 5%. Parliament’s New Year Under the Shadow of Presidential Speculation Parliament will suspend its work tonight for the holiday season and is expected to reopen on January 8. Don’t ask me about the legislative agenda because I estimate that the only topic occupying the political and journalistic scene will be the individual proposed by Kyriakos Mitsotakis for the position of President of the Republic. The Prime Minister stated in his interview with ERT that he would reveal the name within the second half of January, triggering another wave of speculation. The official process is expected to commence in Parliament in early February 2025. According to the Constitution, the absolute deadline for the first vote is February 13, one month before the end of Katerina Sakellaropoulou’s term. The first vote requires a majority of 200 MPs; the same threshold applies for the second vote, which takes place five days later. The third vote lowers the threshold to 180 MPs, the fourth to 151 MPs, and, finally, the fifth requires only a relative majority. Poor Anagnostopoulos, what a fate you’ve met After the €5.5 million fines issued yesterday to eight multinational companies, and with more likely to follow for retail chains, no one would want to be in the shoes of the General Secretary of Commerce and Consumer Protection, S. Anagnostopoulos. The General Secretary has been invited tomorrow, Friday, to speak at an internal event of SELPE, the association of major retail chains. The big retail chains are up in arms over the fines, as they believe that the system implemented by the ministry is intentionally convoluted and complex, aimed at imposing fines they deem to serve public relations purposes. So tomorrow, Anagnostopoulos is expected to face heavy pressure as they demand clear rules. Meanwhile, note that a total of 26 companies—multinationals, food manufacturers, and other consumer goods firms, as well as supermarket chains—are under investigation to determine if they comply with the law on profit margin caps. Yesterday’s announcements involved eight companies, so expect more to come in the next few days. The last law passed by Parliament for 2024 extends the validity of the law on “caps on gross profit margins for all products essential for consumer nutrition and dignified living” until April 2025. For now, the government’s intention—provided market conditions stabilize—is not to extend the measure further beyond April, but I wouldn’t bet on it. Hotels: A new investor for Attica Banks are aiming to increase their financing and are closely monitoring tenders and other processes for the sale of European banks’ maritime loan portfolios. Piraeus Bank has taken a significant step by providing over €100 million in financing following a competitive process to the Cypriot Thanos Resort & Hotels, owned by Thanos Michaelides. Michaelides plans to expand his presence in Greece’s hotel sector. The group, which includes the Anassa in Paphos, intends to invest in Attica and Milos. The race to break the €4 barrier Speaking of Piraeus Bank, its stock is once again approaching the €4 mark—the level at which a placement was made last March for 27% of the share capital. Since then, the stock has only managed to stay above this level for three trading sessions, closing at the same price on three other occasions, with an intraday high of €4.08. Yesterday it closed at €3.91, showing an inclination to move toward €4. However, there’s often a gap between intention and reality. We’ll see if the stock gets closer to the generous target prices given by analysts, which range from €5 (Deutsche Bank), €5.90 (JPM), and even €6.31 (Eurobank Equities). Salary increases at SEV The new president of SEV (Hellenic Federation of Enterprises), Spyros Theodoropoulos, brings extensive experience in business transformations and restructuring. He’s undertaking a similar effort at SEV, implementing a new organizational chart and redistributing responsibilities. The goal is to bring SEV’s members closer to society and to activate all members of the Board of Directors and Executive Committee in SEV’s daily operations. This ambitious effort demands considerable work from SEV’s 60 employees, which is why one of the new administration’s first decisions was to significantly increase their salaries. Manousakis’ term at ADMIE renewed Last night, ADMIE Holdings sent a letter to the Chinese State Grid announcing the renewal of the term of ADMIE SA’s Chairman and CEO, Manos Manousakis. The term has been renewed for four years. The Board of Directors will meet tomorrow, Friday, to approve the renewal. €110 million investments in clean energy storage Staying in the energy sector, Deputy Energy Minister Alexandra Sdoukou met yesterday with representatives of 15 companies selected in the first two energy storage tenders. The government aims to expedite the construction of energy storage stations, offering operational support and investment aid. Investors, who collectively are investing €110 million in lithium battery energy storage systems, highlighted key issues they face, primarily the need for new connection infrastructure, such as the development or expansion of substations and networks. These processes are often delayed due to lengthy equipment procurement timelines. Additionally, delays in licensing procedures that impact overall project progress were also discussed. Sdoukou pledged to support each case individually, announcing the creation of a special coordination team. This team will work closely with ADMIE, RAE, and DAPEEP to resolve all licensing and technical issues. Timely project completion is critical, as they are funded by the Recovery Fund under strict deadlines. Let’s see if anything gets done! Lavipharm’s Investment Lavipharm’s new investment in transdermal drug production is set to launch in early 2025. The modifications and expansion of part of the production facilities in Paiania have already been completed, and the mechanical equipment is arriving in Greece in the coming period. This investment is a cornerstone of the pharmaceutical company’s business plan, as it will double its transdermal production capacity, while the addition of the new production line ensures uninterrupted manufacturing. Over the past five years, Lavipharm has achieved a 55% increase in its market share, and its management has stated that it is exploring opportunities for new drug acquisitions while also making new moves focused on pharmaceutical production. Alumil’s “Trump Trade” Alumil, led by G. Mylonas, is steadily moving towards a market capitalization of €150 million. Its stock, now at €4.59, is 58.2% higher than three months ago. After struggling through the tough years of 2013–2022 and eventually reaching an agreement with banks and servicers to handle its heavy debt load, Alumil is beginning to see light at the end of the tunnel. The next step is to spin off its casting division and sell 70% of the new company (Alufond) to a foreign investor. G. Mylonas, encouraged by Trump’s election, has turned his gaze across the Atlantic, aiming to finalize the deal within the first quarter of 2025. Even if it slips to the second quarter, it’s no big deal—after all, in the market, you hear a lot of talk but see little action. Window Dressing Next week, the Athens Stock Exchange will remain closed on Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, and the day after. Opportunities for short-term investment strategies are extremely limited. The primary goal of window dressing remains a top priority. As previously mentioned, Piraeus Bank aims to bridge the gap to the €4 placement level (yesterday it closed at €3.91, up +1.79%) so that those who invested at that time don’t end the year in the red. Similarly, National Bank has risen to €7.70 (+1.45%), Athens International Airport to €8, Cenergy to €9.25, and so on. By Tuesday, December 31, everyone will close their books with satisfaction and present the results of their efforts to shareholders, investors, and stakeholders. These movements, coupled with the lack of large-scale strategic placements, have brought the General Index to 1,455.67 points, with a modest increase of +0.2%. While trading volume may appear higher, it isn’t—of the €155.3 million total, €57.1 million came from a large Eurobank package and several smaller ones, leaving €85 million in stock trades on the board. Once again, Coca-Cola HBC, typically the General Index’s reliable supporter, remained at €32.80 (-1.5%), leaving OPAP (+2.21% at €15.74) and Motor Oil (+1.38%) to take over its role. Meanwhile, a consistent seller is holding PPC at €11.70, despite analysts’ glowing reports making headlines. Nuclear Energy and Artificial Intelligence: Parallel Paths Yesterday, Meta published an RFP (Request for Proposals) seeking a provider for a nuclear energy installation of up to 4 gigawatts to meet the growing energy demands of its data centers. This move reflects a broader trend in the artificial intelligence industry, where the exponential growth in computational requirements is creating unprecedented demand for stable and reliable energy. Meta’s strategy to place nuclear plants near its data centers aims to minimize energy transmission losses. Given that Meta is already the largest corporate buyer of renewable energy in the U.S., with 6.7 GW in operation, this step marks a new era where nuclear energy suddenly emerges as a key pillar for the growth of artificial intelligence.

Use the controls in the far right panel to increase or decrease the number of terms automatically displayed (or to completely turn that feature off). Archives An intensification of surface Earth’s energy imbalance since the late 20th century, Li et al., Communications Earth & Environment: Tracking the energy balance of the Earth system is a key method for studying the contribution of human activities to climate change. However, accurately estimating the surface energy balance has long been a challenge, primarily due to uncertainties that dwarf the energy flux changes induced and a lack of precise observational data at the surface. We have employed the Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) method, integrating it with recent developments in surface solar radiation observational data, to refine the ensemble of CMIP6 model outputs. This has resulted in an enhanced estimation of Surface Earth System Energy Imbalance (EEI) changes since the late 19th century. Our findings show that CMIP6 model outputs, constrained by this observational data, reflect changes in energy imbalance consistent with observations in Ocean Heat Content (OHC), offering a narrower uncertainty range at the 95% confidence level than previous estimates. Observing the EEI series, dominated by changes due to external forcing, we note a relative stability (0.22 Wm−2) over the past half-century, but with a intensification (reaching 0.80 Wm−2) in the mid to late 1990s, indicating an escalation in the adverse impacts of global warming and climate change, which provides another independent confirmation of what recent studies have shown. Fusion of Probabilistic Projections of Sea-Level Rise, Grandey et al., Earth's Future: A probabilistic projection of sea-level rise uses a probability distribution to represent scientific uncertainty. However, alternative probabilistic projections of sea-level rise differ markedly, revealing ambiguity, which poses a challenge to scientific assessment and decision-making. To address the challenge of ambiguity, we propose a new approach to quantify a best estimate of the scientific uncertainty associated with sea-level rise. Our proposed fusion combines the complementary strengths of the ice sheet models and expert elicitations that were used in the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Under a low-emissions scenario, the fusion's very likely range (5th–95th percentiles) of global mean sea-level rise is 0.3–1.0 m by 2100. Under a high-emissions scenario, the very likely range is 0.5–1.9 m. The 95th percentile projection of 1.9 m can inform a high-end storyline, supporting decision-making for activities with low uncertainty tolerance. By quantifying a best estimate of scientific uncertainty, the fusion caters to diverse users. Earth's Climate History Explains Life's Temperature Optima, Schipper et al., Ecology and Evolution: Why does the growth of most life forms exhibit a narrow range of optimal temperatures below 40°C? We hypothesize that the recently identified stable range of oceanic temperatures of ~5 to 37°C for more than two billion years of Earth history tightly constrained the evolution of prokaryotic thermal performance curves to optimal temperatures for growth to less than 40°C. We tested whether competitive mechanisms reproduced the observed upper limits of life's temperature optima using simple Lotka–Volterra models of interspecific competition between organisms with different temperature optima. Model results supported our proposition whereby organisms with temperature optima up to 37°C were most competitive. Model results were highly robust to a wide range of reasonable variations in temperature response curves of modeled species. We further propose that inheritance of prokaryotic genes and subsequent co-evolution with microbial partners may have resulted in eukaryotes also fixing their temperature optima within this narrow temperature range. We hope this hypothesis will motivate considerable discussion and future work to advance our understanding of the remarkable consistency of the temperature dependence of life. Widespread outdoor exposure to uncompensable heat stress with warming, Fan & McColl, Communications Earth & Environment: Previous studies projected an increasing risk of uncompensable heat stress indoors in a warming climate. However, little is known about the timing and extent of this risk for those engaged in essential outdoor activities, such as water collection and farming. Here, we employ a physically-based human energy balance model, which considers radiative, wind, and key physiological effects, to project global risk of uncompensable heat stress outdoors using bias-corrected climate model outputs. Focusing on farmers (approximately 850 million people), our model shows that an ensemble median 2.8% (15%) would be subject to several days of uncompensable heat stress yearly at 2 (4) °C of warming relative to preindustrial. Focusing on people who must walk outside to access drinking water (approximately 700 million people), 3.4% (23%) would be impacted at 2 (4) °C of warming. Outdoor work would need to be completed at night or in the early morning during these events. ["uncompensable" means physiologically intolerable, acutely dangerous, ultimately deadly] Stabilising CO2 concentration as a channel for global disaster risk mitigation, Lu & Tambakis, Scientific Report: We investigate the influence of anthropogenic CO2 concentration fluctuations on the likelihood of climate-related disasters. We calibrate annual incidence rates against global disasters and CO2 growth spanning from 1960 to 2022 based on a dynamic panel logit model. We also study the sensitivity of disaster incidence to stochastic carbon dynamics consistent with IPCC-projected climate outcomes for 2100. The key insight is that present and lagged CO2 growth contains valuable information about the likelihood of future disaster events. We further show that lowering carbon stock uncertainty by dampening the persistence or the variability of CO2 concentration has a first-order impact on mitigating expected disaster risk. Fact-checking information from large language models can decrease headline discernment, DeVerna et al., Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences: This study explores how large language models (LLMs) used for fact-checking affect the perception and dissemination of political news headlines. Despite the growing adoption of AI and tests of its ability to counter online misinformation, little is known about how people respond to LLM-driven fact-checking. This experiment reveals that even LLMs that accurately identify false headlines do not necessarily enhance users’ abilities to discern headline accuracy or promote accurate news sharing. LLM fact checks can actually reduce belief in true news wrongly labeled as false and increase belief in dubious headlines when the AI is unsure about an article’s veracity. These findings underscore the need for research on AI fact-checking’s unintended consequences, informing policies to enhance information integrity in the digital age. Droughts in Wind and Solar Power: Assessing Climate Model Simulations for a Net-Zero Energy Future, Liu et al., Geophysical Research Letters: Understanding and predicting “droughts” in wind and solar power availability can help the electric grid operator planning and operation toward deep renewable penetration. We assess climate models' ability to simulate these droughts at different horizontal resolutions, ∼100 and ∼25 km, over Western North America and Texas. We find that these power droughts are associated with the high/low pressure systems. The simulated wind and solar power variabilities and their corresponding droughts during historical periods are more sensitive to the model bias than to the model resolution. Future climate simulations reveal varied future change of these droughts across different regions. Although model resolution does not affect the simulation of historical droughts, it does impact the simulated future changes. This suggests that regional response to future warming can vary considerably in high- and low-resolution models. These insights have important implications for adapting power system planning and operations to the changing climate.

One-off paid access fees are generally astronomically priced, suitable for such as "On a Heuristic Point of View Concerning the Production and Transformation of Light" but not as a gamble on unknowns. With a median world income of US$ 9,373, for most of us US$ 42 is significant money to wager on an article's relevance and importance. Most articles appearing here are found via RSS feeds from journal publishers, filtered by search terms to produce raw output for assessment of relevance. Relevant articles are then queried against the Unpaywall database, to identify open access articles and expose useful metadata for articles appearing in the database. The objective of New Research isn't to cast a tinge on scientific results, to color readers' impressions. Hence candidate articles are assessed via two metrics only: A few journals offer public access to "preprint" versions of articles for which the review process is not yet complete. For some key journals this all the mention we'll see in RSS feeds, so we include such items in New Research. These are flagged as "preprint."

Introduction to Bitcoin Lecture Video Super pumped to share with you, my first full length lecture on an introduction to bitcoin, the bitcoin Revolution, and also this edited transcript that I provided for you! What to become: STOIC VLOG Something I have been meaning to write or create or do is like some sort of book, ebook, pamphlet, or introductory primer to stoicism. I really think that stoicism is probably one of the most useful and philosophical models to live normal every day real life. Yet, I haven’t really found a good instructional guide on it, especially when I was self teaching it to myself. Consider this a practical primer, cutting through the BS: Stoicism, stoic, the stoa in ancient Greece– essentially the stoa was like some sort of portico, patio, pillar, outside, essentially a spot where guys would just hang out, talk shop, talk philosophy, etc. ￼ ￼ I think about the show “Hey Arnold” in which I was raised with… the notion of “stoop kid“, the notion of a stoop is that in a lot of cities, especially the east coast in New York, you have this little stoop or porch, stairs that go outside your front door… and you could just hang out there, engage in social and neighborhood life etc. One of my happiest moments was when I was living in Providence Rhode Island, and then COVID-19 hit. Everything was closed, besides the park. I can still go to the park, hang out, workout, do chin ups– I learned how to do muscle ups, more bodyweight calisthenics stuff, and also… I had a lot of fun with this “rock toss“ challenge and workout… in the middle of the park was a huge ass rock and huge ass stone, and every single day I would go there pick it up, and then eventually work out with it; throwing it around for fun, doing overhead presses with it, clean and jerks, squats, and eventually I would just throw it around for fun. Funny enough it might have been the most fit I was in my life… this was the true “functional” fitness. The inspiration — Hector lifting an insanely massive stone (barely 2 strong men could lift it)… using it to break down the door of the ships of the other side. Anyways, the reason why that period of covid was so good is that it was in the middle of beautiful Providence Rhode Island summer, so nice and bright and warm and lovely… and one of the good things was going to the park was like an open forum, a new anatheum for a lot of really cool guys to come, hang out, talk shop, go topless and shirtless, workout and hang out. I met some really interesting people during that period of time. I met some guys who were really cool. For example, one guy I met was in the US military Navy, I think he was training to be a Navy seal or Delta force or something. Another guy in some sort of ROTC training, another cool guy from the hood, and also I would say I probably met half a dozen friendly drug dealers there. And of course a lot of people who believed in conspiracy theories; really friendly, a little weird, but overall good guys. Anyways, one of the biggest benefits of hanging out at that outdoor park, open air, nothing but green grass, the beautiful sun and the fitness equipment was that I think having this sort of open air environment is actually very conducive to socializing, thinking and thought, and pro social behavior. My theory about a lot of modern day antisocial behavior has to do with the structures which enclose us. For example, almost universally most guys at the gym are extremely antisocial. Why? My theory is that because most gyms have closed, cramped narrow ceilings, and do not have access to natural light, or outside space. Cramped indoor spaces promote antisocial behavior. The only good gym I went to which was interesting was the golds gym in Venice, which has this really big outdoor workout area. I think this is much more natural and more fun and better; to be able to work out directly outside outdoors, with your shirt off. Stoics, stoicism — it was originally I think codified by this guy named Zeno, and over time he picked up some followers. Essentially the whole thing happened organically; Zeno would first share his thinking on philosophy ethics and pragmatic ways to deal with other people and the downsides of life, he built a following, and then his followers would propagate the thoughts and start their own little schools of thoughts, their own little stoic clubs. Would I like about stoicism is how loosey goosey it is. It is kind of like zen, or taoism… it is not really quantified as a religion, or a strict moral order. In fact, a lot of the ancients stoics would meditate on random stuff like cosmology, natural sciences like Seneca, how volcanoes worked or whatever. I think nowadays in today’s world, we focus primarily on the pragmatic side; how to deal with fear, uncertainty, downsides etc. ￼I think I might’ve first learned about stoicism from Nassim Taleb and his ANTIFRAGILE book. I was curious, and my curiosity went to deep. To quote NASSIM TALEB and the Venetian saying “The ocean goes deeper, the deeper you wade into it.” I literally consumed every single book I could find on stoicism, even the obscure ones. Funny enough, a lot of the stoic thinkers tried to claim other philosophers as being stoic, like Seneca did with Diogenes the cynic. ￼ Cynic, cynicism, actually comes from the word canine, the dog. Diogenes was considered the “dog” philosopher, first used as a pejorative, but ultimately Diogenes reappropriated that title for fun! He saw dogs as tough, almost like wild wolves, rather than seeing them as a negative thing. Even Achilles when he was raging against king Agamemnon, he called him “dog faced“ as a heaping insult. First, Seneca. Seneca the younger, his dad was called Seneca the elder. In fact, this is such a big deal because Cindy and I named our first son, Seneca, directly after the stoic philosopher. This is true soul in the game; if you name your kid after your favorite philosopher, certainly it is a sign that you really liked that philosopher, or found them impactful. ￼￼￼The reason why I really like Seneca the stoic philosopher is because he had real connections to real reality. What that means is he wasn’t just on the sidelines; he actually existed in the real world, engaged in real politics, was even advisor to the emperor Nero, the bad one, who eventually low-key coerced Seneca to commit suicide, in a manly, dignified manner. I think this was because maybe… there was actually a plan to overthrow Nero, and essentially Nero found out. ￼ I really like Seneca because his writing is accessible, practical and pragmatic, and interesting. A lot of thinkers tend to lack connections to real reality, I have no tolerance for boring philosophers to talk about metaphysics, which is things which are not physical. Like thoughts ideas, the universe, electricity and energy, strange phenomenon and conspiracy theories on ghosts, “energy” whatever. ￼￼For a long time, I would hear the term “metaphysics” being thrown around, and I had zero idea what it actually meant. ￼ Meta– on top of. Or nestled within. Physics — the physical, physical phenomenon like gravity, first principles. The reason why metaphysics philosophers tend to be a bunch of losers is that they are all weak and anemic, nerds or geeks or weaklings who seem to have some sort of physiological degeneracy, which encourages them to opine or talk or think about impractical things, superficial things. Personally speaking, I think philosophy must be practical. ￼￼￼￼ Practical, praxis, ￼practice — to do! I have a very funny ideal; the general idea is that your body looks like a demigod, and your physiology is out of control. The general idea is one must be tall, strong, highly muscular, low body fat percentage, I’m not exactly sure what my body fat percentage is, but maybe it’s around 5%. ￼￼Also, physical fitness is critical to any stoic. My ideal is to walk 50 miles a day, eat 20 pounds of meat like Milo of Croton a day. And also, abstinence from silly things like media, alcohol, drugs, marijuana etc. Trust no thinker who does drugs! Even our best friend Nietzsche said that coffee was bad, because it would make people dark and gloomy. He encouraged 100% cocoa powder instead. ￼￼￼ Simple technique: First, look at a picture or a portrait or a full body shot, ideally topless of the artist, philosopher or thinker or individual… then judge their thoughts later. Why? My theory is this: the thoughts of an individual is hugely affected by their bodily physiology. For example, an extreme example: if somebody is locked inside a solitary confinement cell, and not permitted to go outside for years, but, he had a pen and pad and would jot down some thoughts… Would be the quality of these thoughts? Certainly dark and morose. In today’s world, why does it matter, what is the significance of stoicism, etc.? First and foremost, I think we are living in a troubling time, especially with the advent of modern day internet based media and advertising. I think 99% of what is propagated on the internet is fear mongering, and what is hate? Hate is just fear. The first thought on stoicism is that it is just fear conquering. What I discovered about street photography, is that 99% of it is conquering your fears. Conquering your fears of upsetting other people, getting in some sort of verbal or physical altercation etc. In fact my bread and butter workshop is my conquering your fears and street photography workshop, the workshop which is still interesting to me even after a decade. Why is this so important? I think it is rooted in almost everything; conquering your fears is rooted in entrepreneurship, innovation, risktaking and real life. Even my speculation in crypto. 99.9% of crypto speculation is just balls. Having the balls to make big bets, and when things go south, knowing how to master your emotions. A simple extra I have is this: just imagine it will all go down to zero. It was useful because when I was in college, my sophomore year I got really into trading stocks, and I eventually lost my whole life savings, maybe around $3500 USD, and some bad penny stock which I actually misread the financials… the whole time I thought the company was making a profit, but actually it was taking a loss. I actually didn’t know that if profits are written in parentheses, it means a loss. It was funny because my initial start as an investor was back in high school, I bought some Adobe stock when I was a high school junior, and also some mutual funds, which both went up after about 4-5 years. ￼Also I remember in elementary school computer class, when I was in the sixth grade in Bayside Queens, there was some sort of stock stimulation trading game, and actually it was funny… the kids who made the most money and were the most successful just put 100% of everything into Apple, note this is when we were only 12 years old, and I was born in 1988. ￼Funny enough, it seems that stoicism actually plays well with capitalism. Why? According to modern day capitalist thinking, the best way to approach life is to be objective, strong, stoic, unemotional, logical and rational. Also, ￼with modern day media there is so much fear mongering in the news, about some sort of global armageddon, global financial ruin, etc. I call it “fear porn”. Therefore stoicism as a mindset is useful to think and position your mind in such a way that you could consider that life is all upside, no downside. In fact, if I could summarize stoicism in one sentence, it is that life is all upside, no downside. Inspired by NASSIM TALEB. So, is stoicism useful to you if you’re a man or a woman? Does it matter? The good thing is I think it could apply to both sexes. Conquering sexism and social pressures is useful if you’re woman, and also if you’re a man. Also, gender is social. Lot of the expectations set on us by society is socialized and gamed to a certain degree. First, we got to unchain ourselves from modern day ethics and morality. I believe that all modern day philosophy and thinking and ethics and religion is bad. For example, the notion of turning the other cheek is a patently bad one. Why did Jesus turn his cheek? It is because he lacked on army. Also, philosophically I think we should put no trust in Socrates. ￼￼￼I thought which has puzzled me for a long time was this “Why was Socrates so ugly? Monster in face, monster in soul. I think Socrates was a degenerate, and he lacked any sort of real power. Therefore he turned logic and rationality into his terrorizing weapon (via Nietzsche). Back in the day, you didn’t need logic or rationality to have things your way, you simply was able to dictate that which you wanted to pause it, because you had a military force behind you. Just think about Machiavelli and IL PRINCIPE– the reality of being a mercurial prince, king, and military leader is hard, stoic, “immoral”. But ultimately it all comes down to war, conquest, the military. Trust nobody who uses rationality or logic as their tyrannizing weapon. ￼ In fact, I believe that all should have the body and strength of some sort of super soldier. Essentially look like all the guys from the movie 300, this is our ideal. Demigod physique. ￼ And this is the true courage of Kanye West; he literally put everything on the line, and even lost his spouse and I think maybe his kids? All for the sake of revealing inequities. ￼ “I throw these Maybach keys fucking c’est la ￼vie! I know that we the new slaves.”￼- Ye The fun thing about stoicism is that you could just make it up as you go, devise your own strategies and whatever. “Fucking c’est la vie!” My favorite Kanye West line. Essentially the general idea is that in life, one should not take things too seriously. Laughter is golden, I forget the philosopher who was called the laughing philosopher… Democritus?; better to laugh about the follies of human beings rather than to be dark and morose about it. Also, thoughts from the Odyssey; if you look far enough ￼ into the future, everything becomes comedic and hilarious. So when you’re in some sort of bad situation, just think to yourself “Perhaps one day, 20 or 30 years from now… I will look back at this and just laugh!” It will just be humorous. Honestly, laughter, and kind of being able to joke about things might be the best way to live life and deal with setbacks. ￼ Problems in modern day life: A funny thing I have learned is that when you call something something, it isn’t that. For example, if someone calls something a “luxury car”, it ain’t. For example, a true modern day luxury car is maybe a Tesla, but Tesla never calls itself a luxury car. Also the ultimate luxury technology company is probably Apple… but Apple is very intelligent and not calling themselves a luxury brand. A pro tip is when it comes to websites, read the alternative text, the header text, the stuff that shows up in the tab of your browser window. If the website, the automotive retailer tries to market themselves as a “luxury” brand, typically it is actually a sign that it isn’t a luxury brand it isn’t luxury brand. Thought: what are some good examples of true luxury brands which don’t overly calls itself luxury? ￼￼ In someways, we can think and consider stoicism as our new luxury. In fact, having luxury, luxury of mind and soul… and luxury of freedom of speech, isn’t this the ultimate luxury? When somebody asked Diogenes the cynic; “What is the best human good”? He said “Freedom of speech, speaking your mind, having the power to see whatever is on your mind.” In fact, my current joy is becoming more and more free talking, and free riding. What that means is this; I’m ain’t going to censor myself no more, even if I might be politically incorrect insensitive or whatever. ￼ Also, I would prefer to speak my mind and seriously hurt the feelings of others, rather than soften it for the sake of the other person. ￼￼￼Similarly speaking, when people call themselves “influencers”, they are not influencers. Ultimately I think we should think of stoicism just like having another tool inside our tool kit. For example, if you’re a chef, you’re going to have different knives for different purposes. If you’re going to cut a big piece of meat, you probably want a big ass meat cutting knife, not something you would use to slice an apple with. Similarly speaking, if you’re going to scoop out the insides of an avocado, better to use a spoon rather than using a fork, or a knife. ￼ I think the problem is when some people get too into stoicism (I prefer writing stoicism with a lowercase￼), they think that everything needs to be consistent, and must fit into this nice little neat box of what is considered “stoicism“. This is a bad line of thinking… let us consider that Marcus Aurelius never even mentioned stoicism in his writings, his collections of thoughts, which we moderns call THE MEDITATIONS… it was just essentially his personal diary, to help him conquer his own personal fears and thoughts, I don’t think he ever intended it to be published publicly. I think he just wrote it to himself as self therapy. And I think the only stoic philosopher he even mentions is maybe Epictetus. For myself, I just come out with certain to work out thoughts and techniques because it helps me, and when I find these tricks or techniques or secret hacks or cheat codes… My passion is to simply share it with others. ￼￼￼￼ And ultimately, things are ever in flux and evolving and changing and adapting. For example, I’ve discovered the quality of my thinking is different when I am in Culver City Los Angeles, compared to being in the boring suburbs of Orange County. Also depending on my social environments… my stoic thoughts are different when I am in a gym, vs just working out by myself in my parking spot in the back of my apartment. Also, the quality of my thoughts is different when living with family members or other people versus just living with myself Cindy and Seneca. Assuming you’re not growing your own vegetables and living in the middle of nowhere… you probably have some interaction with other human beings. As long as you have an iPhone, an Android phone, a smartphone, a 4G or 5G internet connection, wifi, a laptop, have to buy groceries somewhere… you’re still going to have to interact with other human beings. And this is good. There is no other greater joy than other human beings. In fact, modern-day society is strange because in someways, the ethos is to be antisocial and to be cowardly. But in fact, the best way to think about things is that real life is interaction with other human beings, and social conquest. One can imagine a lot of modern day entrepreneurship as simply a big dick swinging contest. He who is the most masculine confident tall and strong and stoic shall win. Assume that everyone is mentally insane: Have you ever been out in public, and you see some sort of crackhead or strange homeless person who acts radically, smells terrible, and is obviously mentally ill? Do you hate them for it? When they say something weird to you… do you take it personally? No. Why? They are crazy. Perhaps we should just adopt this stoic mindset towards other people; some people are actually physiologically ill, mentally unwell… don’t trust the opinion of nobody. A lot of people are trying to actually deal with their own inner demons: For example, becoming the successful photographer and street photographer I am today… I’ve dealt with some individuals who would say anonymous bad things about me, and later I found out that their mom just died or something. I cannot imagine what it feels like losing a mother… therefore if somebody spew some hate on me because something bad happened to them, I’m not gonna take it personally. ￼￼￼￼￼Self-flagellation: I think a lot of people who are sick, mentally or physiologically self flagellate themselves. Essentially the way that they deal with other people or themselves is some sort of metaphorical self-flagellation. For example… you know those strange individuals who have the whip and whip themselves, and inflict pain on themselves? I think some people do this metaphorically to themselves and others. You just want to stay away from them. My personal theory on fear is that a lot of it is tied to morality and ethics. I think the general idea is not necessarily that we are afraid of anything… I think the true fear is that we’re afraid that we are some sort of bad evil unethical immoral person. For example in street photography, the general ethical thought is that it is immoral to take a photo of somebody without their permission, because there is some sort of it inherent evil behind it. Is this true? No. Taking photos and not really a big deal. I think it is because some people are just overly sensitive, which once again comes from some sort of physiological weakness. For example, if you’re a weightlifter who could lift 1000 pounds, assuming you’re not taking any steroids or anything… are small things going to bother you? No. But let us assume that you are a skinny fat man, all you do is drink alcohol and smoke marijuana and watch Netflix, and you spent too much time on Reddit… you are 40% body fat, and have never lifted in your life. And also your testosterone is low and you never go outside. Certainly the quality of your thoughts is going to be different than if you’re a happy gay monster, lifting weights outside in the direct sun, laughing and having fun. ￼￼￼ In fact, I’ve actually personally discovered that the reason why a lot of people hate me is because I am so happy jovial and gay. They are secretly suspicious or envious of me? ￼ Probably one of my worst experiences was this jarring transition; I was super happy insanely happy being in Vietnam in 2017; with a beautiful weather, the beautiful light, the happy people the great amenities etc.… and then that winter Cindy and I went to Europe, in Marseille Berlin and Prague, and maybe London… seriously the worst winter of my life. Why? I wonder if so much miserable feelings and thoughts simply comes from the darkness and lack of light. a lot of Europe is actually quite miserable; dark, unhygienic, morose. Even Nietzsche had a thought about Schopenhauer; How much of these emo European philosophers came from the fact that it was just complaining about the cold weather in Germany etc.?￼￼For myself, my ideal weather is Southeast Asia; I love being in Phnom Penh Cambodia, Vietnam etc. In the states, am I the only one who loves living in Los Angeles? Dr. Dre and Kendrick Lamar said that LA was the best for women weed and weather… I would definitely say the biggest upside of living in Los Angeles is the light, the sunlight. It actually does get quite cold here, but usually most reliably even in December during the winter time, the sun will always come up. As long as there is bright sunny light, I will be happy. And I think maybe for myself, considering that I am a photographer, and photography means painting with light… light for me is critical. I also wonder how much of it is a physiological thing and a genetic trait; for example I could even recall being a young child, and my mom telling me that the most critical thing in finding a home or an apartment was light and natural light. Even now… 90% of my happiness comes from being able to ￼have access to natural light, ideally floor to ceiling windows facing directly the sun, having some sort of modern temperature regulated apartment and home. Even living in our tiny studio minimalistic luxury apartment in Providence Rhode Island, where it was always 75° warm and cozy, and not frigid and damp and cold and dark and humid… I was always good. But moving to an older house, where it always felt damp and cold… this literally lowered my happiness by 1000%. Therefore, if you’re feeling miserable sad or whatever… I say spend three months living in Hanoi or Saigon in Vietnam, or go to Phnom Penh Cambodia. I wonder if 90% of peoples misery is simply due to the weather. ￼￼”Better to be a gay monster than a sentimental bore!” – Fernandino Galliani, via Nietzsche My stoic ideal is somebody who is happy, gay, smiling, no headphones or AirPods on, no sunglasses on, no hat, no facial hair, no baggy oversized clothing, no tint in their car. Somebody who makes great eye contact, laughs, stands up upright, jokes, and fools around. Like an overgrown child. ￼Also, lift weights at least once every day, ideally in the direct sun. Just buy some weightlifting equipment on Titan.fitness, I like the farmers carry handles, the Olympic loadable dumbbell, and also the Texas power squat bar. Just buy some cheap weights, and or buy a heavy 400 pound sandbag, and just have fun throwing it around. A true stoic should look something like Hercules or Achilles. Or like ERIC KIM; I have the aesthetic and the physique of Brad Pitt in FIGHT CLUB except with a lot more muscle. Like my friend Soren says, the Adonis physique and proportions. I think a real stoic is sexy, happy and fun. Who doesn’t take life too seriously; and think of everything like a fun game. A real stoic would be joyful and cheery like three-year-old child without any adulteration from the outside world. I don’t like talking with or hanging out with adults, uninteresting. At what point or age do people become so emo? Typically, highschoolers are very optimistic. Even college students. But I think at least in maybe college in high school nowadays… the bad trend is towards “over concern”, about the world the planet ethics animals etc. I find a lot of this thinking superficial, performative, and uncritical. I think “animal rights“, “saving the planet” is this new pseudo world religion; which is just capitalism 3.0. I find the whole pet industry the whole dog industry to be insanely bizarre, and I trust nobody who talks about “saving the planet“ who owns an iPhone, owns any sort of car, or has an Amazon prime subscription. Certainly not any vegans. Animals are animals. They are lower on the hierarchy and totem pole on earth. Man is the apex predator, the apex bully and the apex tyrant. Should we care for animals or “animal rights”? No. Animals are our slaves. If you consider even dogs and pets… they are essentially our emotional slaves. People talk a lot about the virtuosity of dogs being loyal or whatever… and giving you unconditional love. This seems like some sort of emotional slavery. The only dogs I respect are some sort of canine dogs, some sort of attack or defense dogs, or hunting dogs. For example, John Wick 3; Halle Barry and her dogs. An animal should either be a weapon, or nothing. Essentially it looks like men no longer have a backbone. No more spine. I trust nobody who owns a dog. Let us not forget; they call it dog ownership, or “owning a pet”. There is no more concept of “human ownership, or “owning a human.”￼￼￼ What is the end goal of humanity? To me it is towards entrepreneurship, innovation, art and aesthetics, philosophy etc. Design. Stoicism should be considered a tool which could aid you in these things. For example, I think 99% of entrepreneurship is courage. Stoicism could help you with that. I also think with design, great design is also 99% courage, having the courage to attempt something that won’t sell or be received well… stoicism is all about practical courage. The only designers with courage include Steve Jobs, Jony Ive, Elon Musk, Kanye West. ￼ Also, weightlifting. To attempt to lift a certain weight you have never attempted before takes great courage. For example, me atlas lifting 1000 pounds; that is 10 plates and a 25 on each side, ￼￼￼this is true stoic training. Why? The fear of injury is what holds most people back; if you had successfully conquered this fear and not injured yourself, this is pure stoic bliss. I think the only and the only proper way to lift weights is one repetition maximum training. That is; what is the maximum amount of weight you’re able to successfully lift or move, even half an inch? To me, the courage is the success. Even if you had the courage to attempt it… that is what is considered success. ￼￼ Simple exercises to do include the atlas lift, innovated by ERIC KIM, or a one repetition max rack pull. Or, a high trap bar deadlift, heavy Farmer’s walks, or heavy sandbag carries. Or even a simple thing you could do is go to the park or to the local nature center, find the biggest rock there and just see if you could pick it up. If you’re interested in stoicism, and have had some interesting thoughts on stoicism, one of the most noble things you could do is start your own blog. I think blogs are 1000 times more effective than publishing some sort of static printed book; I think the problem in today’s world is that everyone is seeking some sort of legitimacy by being picked up by some sort of legitimate publisher and getting “published“, and seeing your printed book at Barnes & Noble whatever. I say it is better to be open source, free and permissionless, ￼￼￼decentralized. Just publish your thoughts and book as a free PDF, and just host it on dropbox, Google Drive, or your own web server. Share the link freely, and also just publish the raw text as a big blog post. ￼ Even Sam Bankman-Fried wisely thought; 99.9% of books could just be summarized as big blog posts. Don’t trust any modern day published book which isn’t free, because… there is some sort of hidden clout chasing somewhere. ￼ Even one of the worst compromises that led to the demise of Ray Dalio was the fact that he took his Principles book, which was essentially a free ebook PDF on his website, and then took it off, because I think he got a book deal with Simon and Schuster. After he did that, he lost my respect. If you’re already independently wealthy, and you don’t crowd source your self-esteem… why would you need to externally validate yourself by getting some sort of constipated publisher and annoying editor? Editors are bad. Start your own blog and start blogging your own thoughts on stoic philosophy, and even start a YouTube channel and start vlogging on it. ￼￼My generalized thought is simple: if your thought your idea your blog post your video or whatever could even impact the life of one other human being on planet earth… it is worth it.

After paying off a six-figure mortgage and student loans, Brennan and Erin Schlagbaum shifted their focus from debt paydown to wealth-building. Without a mortgage, the couple was able to save the majority of their income. They put most of their money in low-cost index funds and, over time, their brokerage account surpassed the $1 million mark, according to an account screenshot viewed by Business Insider. BI spoke with Brennan, a CPA who runs the financial literacy company Budgetdog, about his investment strategy and what he held in his portfolio as of December 2024. For years, nearly all of the couple's stock-market money was in three Vanguard index funds: a total stock market fund (VTSAX), a total international stock fund (VTIAX), and an emerging markets index fund (VEMAX). In October 2024, they moved 100% of their index funds to ETFs within all of their accounts in response to Vanguard's rollout of automatic ETF investing. They switched to Vanguard's equivalent ETFs, which you can find on the overview page of the index fund. For example, the equivalent ETF of VTSAX, which Schlagbaum said was their biggest holding, is VTI. The equivalent of their VTIAX holding is VXUS, and the equivalent of their VEMAX holding is VWO. ETFs and index funds are similar — in fact, many ETFs are index funds — and can offer long-term returns, diversification, and cost savings thanks to low expense ratios. One key difference is how they're traded: ETFs can be bought and sold throughout the trading day, while index funds can only be bought and sold once a day at the close of the trading day. ETFs also typically require a lower investment minimum. You can buy a Vanguard ETF for as little as $1, for example, whereas most Vanguard mutual funds have a $3,000 minimum. The Schlagbaums switched to ETFs for two main reasons: One, they're slightly cheaper. For example, VTSAX has an expense ratio of 0.04%, while VTI has one of 0.03%. Two, ETFs may offer tax savings when compared to index funds. ETF investors are taxed only when they sell the investment, while investors who own mutual funds — and index funds qualify as mutual funds — are liable for paying some capital gains taxes when a fund sells assets and realizes a gain. Just because they're putting their money into ETFs doesn't mean their strategy is shifting. They're still playing the long-term, buy-and-hold game, Schlagbaum said, adding that, "if you stay in index funds, it's not going to make or break you long-term." The way he sees it, the ETFs he converted to are very similar in terms of their holdings, just slightly less expensive and more tax-efficient: "It's like, why wouldn't you take it? It's low-hanging fruit, in my opinion." Schlagbaum owns one individual stock: Meta Platforms (META), which he said he bought in October 2022 when the stock price dipped to $97. He prefers index-fund investing to stock picking and especially doesn't like to try to time the market, "but we did time the market a little bit there," he said. "It just seemed like such an obvious buy." He considers META, which is at $624 as of December 16, 2024, "my biggest win of all time." That said, "If you're an investor and you're just starting, individual stocks should not be on your radar. That gets people into so much trouble, and it's not necessary to build wealth. The best investors have the bulk of their portfolio in ETFs and index funds." The couple owns a primary residence, but no investment properties. "If something breaks in my house, I call somebody, even if it's a hanging up a picture," said Schlagbaum. While he has zero interest in managing more than one home, he recognizes the benefit of diversifying his portfolio with real estate, which is why syndication deals make sense for him. A real estate syndication is when investors pool money to purchase a property. Once they contribute capital, their role in the deal becomes completely passive. The real-estate syndicator is responsible for finding the deal, executing the transaction, and, ultimately, delivering returns to the investors. "You lose control from that aspect. You don't really have control over how that performs," said Schlagbaum, who invests in five multi-family syndications. But if you work with a syndicator with a good track record that you trust, "I think it's one of the best ways for somebody that hates real estate but understands the tax benefits of real estate to get in, because you don't have to do anything." A small sliver, 1-5%, of the couple's portfolio is in bitcoin. "We have 1.5, and that position is sitting at $150,000 based on the price right now," said Schlagbaum. "But it's really just 1.5 bitcoin in general. That's going to move with whatever the pricing is, but that's been a huge grower. We were buying at around 15,000, and now it's at 100 plus thousand." When it comes to highly speculative assets, he believes in having a number of things in order before investing: "Bills paid, emergency fund intact, bad debt paid off, retirement secured, non-retirement invested, all other financial goals are handled — and then, if you have extra money, I think bitcoin is a solid buy."

Title: Wishes, love, and reshuffling (afterwards): The Arrival of Pavlos and the… royal matters, the forgotten bank amendment, Viva’s battle in London

Time Published: 2024-12-18T09:33:06Z
Full Content:
Hello! So, a few days ago, I wrote to you about the Christmas spirit making its timely appearance (right on cue as we approach the holidays…). It has been felt in political life, suddenly in the media (let’s see how long that lasts), and, as of yesterday, among the MPs of New Democracy. The meeting of K.M. (Kyriakos Mitsotakis) with them went very well—smiles, selfies, and casual chit-chat about this and that (a little Lebanon, a little Syria, a little Recovery Fund)—and we’re all one big happy family, waiting for:a) The selection of a President of the Republic (that we all need to vote for), andb) The subsequent cabinet reshuffle, in which it’s hoped that around 7-10 MPs will be promoted to deputy ministers, and maybe even ministers, replacing some of the non-parliamentary ministers currently holding office but not contributing much. And the Reshuffle?So, now you might ask, what kind of reshuffle is this going to be? Well, the answer is that I could list everything I’ve heard, you could read it, and then recycle it over festive dinner conversations—but that doesn’t mean Mitsotakis will necessarily follow through with it. Honestly, I think the thread of the reshuffle starts with Gerapetritis and whether K.M. will bring him back to the Maximos Mansion (the Prime Minister’s office) or not. One source tells me that Gerapetritis himself is very keen on returning to his old position, which of course matters. If that happens, there’s one scenario in which Hatzidakis moves to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Pierrakakis to the Ministry of Economy, and Christos Dimas to Education, etc., etc. But let me tell you, I personally wouldn’t hold my breath for such predictions. Columns like this are meant to feature such entertaining reports—or “reports”—that often turn out to be baseless chatter and are far from official government gazettes. The Arrival of PavlosA major stir was caused by yesterday’s revelation that Pavlos (the eldest son of the former King of Greece) has decided to apply for Greek citizenship—a development that constitutes… a great victory for Democracy, considering that he will finally acquire a last name. I’d argue that this is a collective national fixation we’ve failed to resolve for 50 years—unlike every other civilized Western country. As of yesterday, the firstborn son of the former King is in Athens, and it’s not unlikely that he’ll head to the Athens Registry Office with Nikolaos, as it seems acquiring citizenship is a family decision. What Pavlos hasn’t shared with his interlocutors, however, is which surname he has chosen, as this is a prerequisite for identification along with recognition of the Constitution, the form of government, and the 1974 Referendum decision. The entire family will have to file similar applications, and any grandchildren born after citizenship is acquired will automatically inherit it. Pavlos’s Last NameA reliable source tells me that the surname Pavlos has chosen for his family is “Di Grecia,” as it appears on the Danish passports held by members of the former royal family. Of course, when asked about this, Pavlos offers “no comment,” avoiding delving into the issue while not denying the information either. The Banks and the FalloutThe greatest loss for the banks from the recent measures isn’t financial—though it’s not negligible—it’s the communication storm they faced from the political leadership and the press. This has tarnished the industry’s image in a way that cannot be immediately repaired. To be fair, the €100 million for the property entity, as well as the €100 million for schools, had already been put on the table by the banks. Another issue they raised was related to the procedures for the “My Home” program. Specifically, on July 5, 2023, the banks proposed to the government that the engineering certificate requirement be waived for applicants seeking to purchase apartments under the “My Home” program. They even submitted two alternative amendment drafts for this waiver, which would apply only to program beneficiaries. The proposal was made because the banks had identified that “My Home” required contract signings to be completed within 6 to 8 months of eligibility approval—a timeframe often insufficient for property legalizations due to bureaucracy. The Battle for Viva Continues in LondonThe legal battle between WeRealize (WRL), owned by Haris Karonis and Makis Antypas, and JP Morgan over Viva continues unabated. The two shareholders of the Greek fintech filed an appeal against the London High Court’s June ruling on the fair valuation of the company. According to the legal-focused Law360, both sides took issue with aspects of the initial decision. The appeal hearings began on Monday in London, where JP Morgan’s legal team (Freshfields law firm) argued that Viva’s valuation should not include a future U.S. expansion plan. Meanwhile, WRL’s lawyers (from Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan) claimed that JP Morgan has blocked Viva’s U.S. entry and hindered updates to its business plan, which would significantly boost the fintech’s valuation. The dispute centers on Viva’s valuation and which financial figures independent appraisers should use to determine its fair value in a potential sale, as well as the weight of the current business plan. It was revealed in court that any changes to Viva’s business plan require the consent of both shareholders. WRL argued that JP Morgan vetoed any modifications to the plan. The clash essentially revolves around the terms of the call option as part of JP Morgan’s acquisition of 48.5% of Viva, announced in 2022, which valued the fintech at €1.7 billion. According to disclosed terms, WRL forfeits its right to reject any Viva acquisition by JP Morgan if Viva’s valuation falls below €5 billion by the end of the fourth call option period in July 2025. The hearings continue. Signatures for the VOAK before the end of Q1 2025 Demanding procedures and a tight timeline are in place for the implementation of the major concession project Chania-Heraklion, which will become the most complex closed highway constructed in Greece in the coming years. The Northern Road Axis of Crete (VOAK) took center stage recently, as it was the focus of discussions during meetings between the Prime Minister and the political leadership of the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport in Crete. According to the latest plans, the contractual documents for the Chania-Heraklion section are nearing completion and are expected to be finalized by the end of January. At this stage, the provisional contractor, GEK TERNA, is submitting the necessary information to secure its designation as the final bidder. The relevant documents have already been sent to the European Commission for Competition to provide an opinion on the project, and it is estimated that the contract will not be signed before the end of Q1 2025. Industry insiders describe VOAK as a highly challenging project due to the lack of studies and the need for a new route design to address construction difficulties and local opposition. This complexity is one of the reasons why construction companies (GEK TERNA, AKTOR, and METKA) have reached an agreement on managing the project and dividing their shares in both construction and the concession. This agreement is expected to be formalized after the contract signing, meaning after April 2025. It should be noted that both GEK TERNA, which is currently the provisional bidder, and METKA have been part of the project concession from the beginning of the tender, which is expected to exceed €2 billion. AKTOR entered the game later, following its acquisition by the administration of A. Exarchou. Public Proposal Today marks the final deadline set by law for mandatory public offers. Consequently, the informational memorandum by Masdar for TERNA ENERGY is expected to be submitted to the Hellenic Capital Market Commission. Interest from… India… for co-production at HDS At Hellenic Defense Systems (HDS), beyond the matter of the consortium with the Czech group CSG (for which a decision by the Council of State on the injunctive measures is expected any day now), there is considerable activity. Recently, major business groups from… India have expressed interest in producing ammunition at HDS that could be sold in the Middle East, Europe, and Africa. This interest was demonstrated both during a visit by Indian entrepreneurs to Athens 20 days ago and in a meeting between prominent Indian businessmen and the Prime Minister at the Greek ambassador’s residence in London in early December. Moreover, HDS is currently receiving interest in other projects as well, such as the maintenance of Patriot missiles and participation in the IRIS-T missile program, which will expand with new orders worth an additional €50 million. ADMIE and Google The recent, sudden announcement by ADMIE that it has reached an agreement with Serverfarm, a leading data center management company, to create the Gemini joint venture aimed at developing and operating hyperscale-ready data centers in Greece (up to 130MW), now has its explanation. It seems that ADMIE has secured its first major “hyperscale-ready” client for this data center, rumored in the market to be Google. Having already completed 15 years of presence in Greece, Google is ramping up its investments in the country, particularly in the Cloud and Artificial Intelligence sectors. The demand from the private sector for such services is increasing, while the government has also agreed to integrate AI into public services and sectors such as Civil Protection and Health. Meanwhile, ADMIE’s stock is soaring to unprecedented levels, with a market capitalization of €585 million and a price of €2.5, representing an 18.6% increase compared to six months ago. EYDAP is Planning (and Staying Quiet About It) Not a single word escaped the lips of EYDAP’s management yesterday regarding the highly anticipated—and nearly obligatory—placement of shares into institutional portfolios. This move is aimed at ensuring the necessary dispersion of ownership as well as boosting liquidity ahead of the company’s very large and ambitious investment plans. EYDAP’s top priority is to ensure that Athens does not run out of water, which is why it is rushing to finalize the details of connecting the Kremasta Lake with the reservoirs of Evinos and Mornos. Completing this project will require at least two years. Desalination, while considered an expensive (three times the cost) and often ineffective process by EYDAP’s management, could still be used in areas like Thisvi, Aspraspitia, or Itea, where infrastructure and industrial facilities already exist. For the water supply needs of the Hellinikon project, EYDAP plans to follow the successful model used on Aegina. Major parks, such as “Tritsis” and “Hellinikon,” will be irrigated using recycled water, which, however, requires a specialized network. Awaiting the Three Witches of Friday and… Santa Claus Just seven trading sessions remain until the end of this year’s stock market season, and the General Index is just over 3% away from reaching the psychological target of 1,500 points, spurred by the traditional “Santa Claus rally.” On the flip side, without genuine buying interest, most market moves are aimed at “locking in” profits and polishing up the valuations of professional portfolios. Banks continue to offer no support to the General Index, and yesterday other heavyweight stocks faced selling pressure as investors liquidated to increase their cash reserves ahead of the new year. This Friday marks the expiration of derivative contracts across stocks, indices, and commodities, which is why everyone is talking about December’s “triple witching.” Additionally, the FTSE index rebalancing will be finalized, with Autohellas departing after celebrating its transition with a +1.74% gain yesterday. The General Index closed at 1,452.8 points yesterday, losing -0.8%, with a trading volume of €122.14 million, of which just €7.2 million came from block trades. Banks are not seeing strong buying interest, but neither are they facing aggressive sell-offs. OTE, PPC, OPAP, and Jumbo saw losses exceeding 2% yesterday, driven by investment strategies. TITAN (+1.41%) at €39.45 was the only stock managing to offset the weight on the General Index, albeit modestly. How Likely is a Global Debt Crisis Today? Most economists today estimate that the probability of a serious global debt crisis over the next three years does not exceed 30%. Is this figure reassuring? Perhaps. The fact remains that, since we avoided a major debt crisis over the past two years—when public debt skyrocketed (in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic) and central banks dramatically raised interest rates to combat hyperinflation—the likelihood of a global debt crisis is now receding as things calm down. However, there are causes for concern. China, with total public and private debt at 290% of GDP (and half of its population on the brink of poverty), poses a significant risk. Still, China’s debt is almost entirely domestic, denominated in yuan. With inflation under control, its central bank could leverage its balance sheet to buy bonds and stave off a debt crisis if necessary. In the U.S., the fiscal deficit has reached $1.8 trillion in 2024 (6.4% of GDP), with official interest expenses exceeding $1 trillion annually. The spark for a global public debt wildfire could ignite in one of the emerging economies prone to fiscal mismanagement. Finally, serious problems may lurk in the “less transparent” corners of global debt and derivatives markets. There, we can only hope that the lesson of Lehman Brothers has been learned. From France to Germany: Disappointment Continues Germany is far from forming a functional government, and this is already reflected in its business confidence indices. The well-known Ifo Business Index dropped to 84.7 in December, down from 85.6 in November. This is the lowest level for the Ifo since May 2020, significantly below the long-term average of 96.6, with disappointment visible even when compared to recent years. Since the start of the war in Ukraine, the index has averaged just 88.2. The plunge in the Ifo Index is attributed to a sharp drop in expectations, which fell from 87 in November to 84.4 in December. The Lonely Party of the “Magnificent Seven” The Magnificent Seven was a classic 1960s Western directed by John Sturges, depicting the gritty journey of seven gunfighters in the Wild West. In today’s glamorous world of Wall Street, the term “Magnificent Seven” has been repurposed by Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett to describe the seven tech giants: Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook), Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Tesla—which, while not just an automaker, is now regarded as a high-tech company. These seven stocks are currently worth over $18 trillion. They have recorded gains of around 50% since the beginning of the year, compared to the 20% gains of the other 493 stocks in the S&P 500 and the index’s overall +28% increase. This is happening while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has recorded its ninth consecutive losing session as of late last night, marking the longest downward streak since 1978.

These 11 economists, strategists, and analysts made prescient calls that defined financial markets in 2024 In many ways, market trends in 2024 seemed like a continuation of those in 2023. The US economy remained on its path to a soft landing. Artificial intelligence companies retained their dominance and repeatedly beat earnings. And it increasingly looks like the S&P 500 is due to post another year of 20%+ returns. But that doesn't mean there weren't new developments in various corners of the market, or that these trends were particularly easy to predict. That's where Business Insider's 2024 Oracles of Wall Street list comes in, highlighting strategists, analysts, and economists who were on the money with their calls this year. Selections were made based on internal and external nominations, and those whose calls were both accurate and against consensus at the time were given the most weight. The list, of course, is not exhaustive, but it aims to lift some of the most impressive calls recently for some of the biggest trends in markets this year. Below, we break down how each selectee made their calls and share their top forecasts for 2025. The S&P 500 has continued on its torrid pace in 2024, posting 27% gains so far in 2024. Investors have cheered on rate cuts, artificial intelligence investment, economic stability, and Trump's election victory, lifting the index beyond most expectations. As the index sits just below 6,100, some strategists were closer than most with their predictions. Last December, the median 2024 year-end price target among top Wall Street strategists was just 4,500, according to Bloomberg data. In December 2023, DeGraaf said the S&P 500 could hit 5,800 in the year ahead based on a few pieces of evidence he saw. His proprietary cycle clock indicator, which considers inflation and growth trends, was bullish based on the premise that inflation was expected to stay cool while growth would be moderate enough to induce monetary stimulus. On top of that, investor sentiment was below where it should have been for how the market was performing in 2023, he thought. "Sentiment was ridiculously bearish for the kind of year we were having," DeGraaf said. "That's usually bullish. We call it the skeptical advance." His also-proprietary "thrust" indicator, which considers market momentum gauges, showed a 22% return over the following 12 months as the average outcome given momentum conditions at the time. "We just said, 'Look, this combination of things taking place certainly look bullish," he said. Next year, DeGraaf sees the S&P 500 delivering returns closer to 15%, a bit lower than the 28% gains so far in 2024. "We still like what we see," he said. Back in March, Bartels also predicted that the S&P 500 would rise to 5,800 by the end of the year. Bartels has been bullish since the stock market bottomed out in late 2022. Even when the market saw minor pullbacks in 2024, she pointed to strong corporate earnings and the continued leadership of the technology sector as tailwinds propelling stocks higher. With the index now north of 6,000, that optimism has proven correct. In particular, Bartels strongly believes that AI can transform the economy to the same extent as previous innovations, such as the personal computer. Similar to the early days of the tech boom in the late 1990s, Bartels believes many strategists don't know how to fully price in the impact of AI. "I think people are underestimating the improvement in productivity from AI," Bartels told Business Insider. "Productivity will continue to improve just like we saw from 1995 to 2000." Bartels is confident that the S&P 500 will continue to smash expectations in 2025. She's predicting the index ends next year at 7,200 to 7,400, and she doesn't expect the bull run to fizzle out beyond next year, either — Bartels believes that the S&P 500 could go as high as 10,000 by the end of the decade thanks to pro-business legislation, lower interest rates, and AI. Richey was another strategist who saw the S&P 500 climbing well above consensus. Building on Sevens Report founder Tom Essaye's bullish fundamental outlook, Richey compiled the technical indicators he watches and concluded in February that the index could hit 6,000 by the end of 2024. For example, the S&P 500's relative strength index, which measures price momentum, had stayed in "overbought" territory for three weeks at the time. When that has happened in the past, it's meant that the trend could continue for several months, Richey said. Investor sentiment was also bullish but not over-extended. And the yield curve was still inverted despite no sign of recession. "Some of the biggest gains in the bull market — statistically, it's measurable that they occur during yield curve inversions such as the late '90s and 2006-2007," he said. Going into 2025, however, Richey sees signs that the rally could face hurdles if a negative catalyst comes along. "Looking ahead, the collection of market indicators and cyclical signals we monitor suggest all the pieces are in place for this bull market to end in the weeks or months ahead and for a cyclical bear market to begin," Richey said in an email. But he added that: "There is nothing in the current fundamental backdrop that suggests a bear market in stocks is a sure thing or even likely for that matter." As we start to approach the midpoint of the 2020s, it's becoming increasingly clear that the US economy is in another "Roaring '20s" era a century after the first. Fiscal and monetary stimulus have fueled an extremely robust economic recovery following the pandemic, and artificial intelligence is expected boost profit margins and productivity. One strategist first called this a few years ago, and stuck with it even as recession fears swirled: In late 2021, Draho said in a client note titled "Rose Colored Glasses" that the US economy would enjoy a strong decade ahead. And even as recession fears became consensus in the market in 2022, he stuck with his call, arguing that government spending, artificial intelligence investment, and other factors would boost economic growth and create another "Roaring '20s" era. Three years later, Draho's prediction is well on its way to coming true. The economy has survived a bout of inflation and subsequent Federal Reserve rate hikes, multiple spending packages have been signed into law, and AI has disrupted the market landscape in full force. In 2025, Draho thinks GDP growth will remain higher than 2%, and the S&P 500 will climb to 6,600. "The way things have been trending, it's quite possible that by early 2025 only the most pessimistic investors will need rose-colored glasses to see a clear path to a Roaring '20s outcome," Draho wrote in a September 30 note. The first 50 basis-point cut in 16 years was one of the year's big surprises. Even after the call temporarily became consensus in August, the move at the September FOMC meeting still came unexpectedly to most. But at least a couple of economists stuck to their guns. Many in the market pushed back on Feroli's prediction that the Fed would start off its easing cycle with a 50 basis point cut in September. Other experts argued that such a cut would send the markets into panic by signaling that the economy was in a bad place. However, Feroli, who previously served as an economist at the Fed, believed that a more significant reduction in interest rates would be necessary to strengthen the labor market — and that the Fed would prioritize economic policy over the optics of a 50 basis point cut. Feroli thought the Fed should have started cutting in July, so a larger rate cut in September was one way to help the Fed catch up on its quest to bring interest rates into less restrictive territory. Going forward, Feroli believes 2025 could very well be an uneventful year for both growth and inflation. Trump's reelection means that there's already a playbook for investors of how things went down the first time, he said. However, a change in the White House is still bound to introduce some unknowns to the economy, especially regarding potentially inflationary policy proposals like tariffs and tax cuts, which is why Feroli believes the Fed will cut at a less aggressive pace next year. Feroli doesn't see any more jumbo-sized cuts in the future, and expects a 25 basis point cut in December. Dutta was another economist that stayed with his 50 basis point cut call for the September Fed meeting. He first argued that the Fed would cut by 50 basis points in August, when the Sahm Rule unemployment recession indicator triggered. That quickly became the consensus, but that view quickly faded in favor of a 25 basis point cut after August's inflation data showed continued cooling in price growth. Dutta, however, kept with his call. "The case for 50 is strong, so we are sticking with it," he wrote in a September 15 note. "Powell is more cautious than his counterparts. The most memorable line from his August 23 Jackson Hole speech was, 'We do not seek or welcome further cooling in labor market conditions.' Since then, labor market data has surprised uniformly to the downside." For 2025, Dutta said his highest-conviction view is that investors are overestimating the amount of fiscal stimulus that Congress will approve. "I think the most you can really expect is an extension of the tax law," he said. "Because it's a very thin majority in the House, it's going to be very, very challenging to ram things through." While investors expected rate cuts in 2024, most thought they would come much sooner than they did. A couple of experts, however, argued late last year that the market wasn't appreciating the degree to which the Fed was going to have to put off slashing their benchmark rate as the economy continually proved resilient. This time last year, the market was pricing in a near-0% chance that interest rates would still be above 5% in July 2024, with the expectation that the Fed would begin cutting rates as soon as March 2024. At the time, the federal funds rate was 5.25%-5.5%. But Osmani didn't agree with the overwhelming consensus. Instead, he said in November 2023 that the Fed wouldn't start cutting rates until the second half of 2024. Osmani based his call on the view that central banks would fail to reach their inflation targets. Specifically, wage inflation would continue to be an issue as consumers sought pay raises to keep up with rising prices, further fuelling stickier-than-expected inflation. When July came around, the fed funds rate had remained unchanged from the start of the year, proving Osmani's outlook correct. Looking towards 2025, Osmani believes that inflationary pressures will increase thanks to the impact of tariffs on top of already elevated wage inflation levels. As a result, expect the Fed to behave like a "hawkish dove," he said, meaning that while the Fed won't reverse course on rate cuts, it'll slow the pace of easing. Colmar was also in this camp, defying overwhelming market consensus that the Fed was poised to slash rates early in the year. He argued in January this year that the economy didn't need rate cuts, and that the Fed signaling them would essentially lead to a scenario where financial conditions eased on bullish sentiment, making inflation stickier, further hindering their leeway to cut. Realizing this, the Fed would then need to push rate cuts out as it sought to justify them, he said. Colmar said the Fed would end up cutting by 50-75 basis points in 2024. The central bank has cut by 75 basis points so far, and is expected to drop them again in December, but the market at the time was pricing in more than an 85% chance that rates would be even lower by the end of 2024. Plus, rate cuts have come far later than the market originally expected. "Our view was that interest rates weren't restrictive. Powell had just said that it was very restrictive, and we need to cut rates to bring it back down to equilibrium not to put us into recession. The market seemed to buy into that, and we said, 'No, no, no, he's got it wrong.'" In 2025, Colmar said he sees inflation hovering around 3%, above the Fed's 2% target. After lagging the S&P 500 for the first half of the year, small-cap stocks kicked off a furious rally in July as investors saw rate cuts on the horizon. Small-caps' sudden jump in anticipation of lower borrowing rates and an economic acceleration was one of the biggest moves in the market in 2024. Jonathan Golub saw it coming. The UBS strategist published a client note titled "Small Caps to Outperform Over Near Term" on June 18, and the sector surged just weeks later, with the Vanguard Small-Cap Index Fund ETF (VB) rising 8.5% from July 9-July 15, and 17% in the second half of the year. "Over the past year, Small Cap stocks have outperformed when Treasury yields have declined, and underperformed as they've risen. When this relationship has become disconnected, it has quickly reverted," Golub wrote in June. "Since May 30, Large Caps have outperformed by 6.2% despite falling interest rates, a much larger disconnect than the one experienced earlier in the year. This represents the potential for mid- to high-single-digit Small Cap outperformance over the near term." Heading into 2025, Golub argues in a recent client note that currently high stock valuations are justified. He has overweight ratings on the financials, Industrials, technology, and utilities sectors. Nvidia had an incredible year in 2023, and its share price only flew higher in 2024, rising 180% thanks to impressive earnings beats amid strong demand for its graphics processing unit products. In December of last year, Nvidia was Ramsay's top chip stock pick for 2024. The stock had already appreciated 220% to a price of around $500, and Ramsay was confident that it had another 40% upside, giving it a price target of $700. One year later, Nvidia has broken record after record and Ramsay has repeatedly raised his target. After Nvidia's 10-for-1 stock split in June, Ramsay set the chip giant's price target to $140, up from $120, by year-end. Nvidia's flagship GPU product is used by every leading cloud service provider and AI company — including Google, Meta, Microsoft, Tesla, and OpenAI — to train their large language models. "The suite of superior technology, long pedigree of innovation, and extensive growth-oriented investments should allow for strong, sustained, above-peer growth across a widening set of verticals," Ramsay wrote in a June 9 client note. While Nvidia GPUs are most well known for their use in data centers, Ramsay also mentioned a promising up-and-coming business line: autonomous driving, which became a billion-dollar component of Nvidia's business at the end of fiscal year 2024. Other growing end markets for Nvidia chips include gaming, healthcare, and robotics. Nvidia has smashed analyst estimates every quarter this year, most recently posting $35 billion in revenues last month for fiscal year 2025 Q3. TD Cowen has now upped Nvidia's price target to $175 for the next 12 months, citing sustained customer demand for the company's new Blackwell chips, released in March of this year. Ramsay recently left TD Cowen, the firm said. The price of gold also went on a tear this year, beating the S&P 500 so far thanks partly to rate cuts and global central banks buying up the asset. In July of this year, Milling-Stanley saw a plethora of signs pointing to a rally in the price of gold. At the time, gold was trading at around $2,370 per ounce. Milling-Stanley set a target price of $2,700 by the end of the year, representing 14% further upside. Gold has historically performed well in times of economic uncertainty, and there was plenty of uncertainty in the markets this year. Impending rate cuts, US dollar depreciation, sticky inflation, and geopolitical conflicts all signaled an increased appetite for the yellow metal, as investors sought to put a bigger portion of their portfolio in what has historically been deemed a safe-haven asset. Additionally, central banks in emerging markets began upping their allocation to gold, leading to a spike in buying behavior. The price of gold hit an all-time high ahead of the election on October 30, closing at $2,788 an ounce. It's up 30% overall this year for a price of $2,721 per ounce, in line with Milling-Stanley's prediction. With the potential of several inflationary policies being implemented under Trump, Milling-Stanley doesn't see demand for gold going anywhere in the year ahead. Tariffs, tax cuts, and increased government spending are all inflationary policies that will heat up the economy and increase prices, he said. The increasing national debt will be another factor supporting the price of gold as the dollar weakens, Milling-Stanley said. He predicts an 80% probability for the price of gold to stay at current levels or go higher — potentially as high as $3,100 an ounce by the end of next year. Jump to

We recently published a list of 10 Important AI Announcements for Investors. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Datadog, Inc. (NASDAQ:DDOG) stands against other important AI announcements for investors. Blue Whale Growth, the investment fund supported by billionaire Peter Hargreaves, has reduced its holdings in major US tech firms, mentioning concerns over their substantial AI-related spending. Financial Times reported that fund manager Stephen Yiu highlighted a significant reduction in Microsoft shares, which dropped out of the fund’s top ten holdings for the first time since 2017. He noted that the return on invested capital for the company might decline due to AI investments and hinted at potentially exiting the stock entirely if AI costs exceed cash generation. The “Magnificent Seven” tech giants have faced growing scrutiny over their rising capital expenditures on AI infrastructure, with Wall Street increasingly wary about returns. Yiu has also reduced stakes in Meta and previously exited Amazon and Alphabet, expressing concerns over AI-driven spending outpacing profitability, the report states. While the fund remains optimistic about Nvidia, which now represents around 10% of its portfolio, Yiu expressed less confidence in the other six companies. He also supports Broadcom, benefiting from AI infrastructure development. According to the report, Blue Whale Growth, managing £1.3 billion, has returned 24% this year, outperforming peer funds, but has reduced its exposure to US tech stocks significantly compared to benchmarks.

In stark contrast to the caution seen in Western markets, Southeast Asia’s emerging economies are racing to establish themselves as key players in the global AI landscape. According to CNBC, the region benefits from a youthful, digitally savvy population and growing government support for AI initiatives. While Singapore has already made significant strides in AI adoption, other countries, such as Vietnam, Indonesia, and Malaysia, are also accelerating efforts to harness AI for a range of industries, from agriculture to manufacturing. This growing focus on AI offers immense potential for economic growth, creating new jobs and boosting productivity. However, as these countries ramp up their AI strategies, they face challenges related to infrastructure, digital literacy, and the need for skilled workers. As experts point out, the AI race in Southeast Asia is not just about adoption but about tailoring technology to the region’s unique needs. Despite the hurdles, the region is positioning itself as a promising center for AI innovation, and many expect that ASEAN’s commitment to AI could help its economies thrive in the global tech ecosystem. Meanwhile, SoftBank Group CEO Masayoshi Son is making a bold move to accelerate AI development globally. Son plans to invest $100 billion in the U.S. over the next four years, with a significant focus on artificial intelligence and related infrastructure. His goal is to create 100,000 AI-related jobs before the end of President-elect Donald Trump’s term, as reported by Reuters. Known for his strong advocacy for AI, Son has already made notable investments in AI companies such as OpenAI and Graphcore, further signaling his commitment to the sector’s growth. This massive investment, paired with Southeast Asia’s rising AI ambitions, highlights the growing global momentum behind artificial intelligence. For this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. We listed the stocks in ascending order of their hedge fund sentiment taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 900 hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

(NASDAQ:DDOG) provides a cloud-based platform that offers monitoring and security solutions for applications and infrastructure. The company leverages AI to improve performance analysis, improve security management, and streamline workflows across cloud environments. Mizuho analyst Gregg Moskowitz upped his price target for Datadog (NASDAQ:DDOG) to $170, up from $155, while keeping an Outperform rating on the stock as part of his outlook for the software sector in 2025. This adjustment reflects the broader trend of increasing valuations for several companies, driven by higher comparison multiples. Moskowitz noted: “DDOG remains a clear leader in the observability market, with multiple businesses at scale, and with potential tailwinds in the form of digital transformation, cloud migration, and GenAI.” The firm expressed a more optimistic view than many regarding cloud adoption in the coming years, mentioning both existing on-premise customers and new clients as key drivers. This was part of its detailed 2025 software sector outlook. Overall, DDOG ranks 6th on our list of important AI announcements for investors. While we acknowledge the potential of DDOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Title: CFOs Are Paid More, But Have Less Job Security

Plus: Signet Jewelers CFO Talks About Her Strategy To Boost Top Line Growth, Rate Cut Is Likely This Week, SoftBank Makes Huge U.S. Investment Pledge, A Tax Deductible Executive Security Plan The CFO’s role is becoming more important to the company overall. In recent years, CFOs have played a more active role in creating strategy for the company overall, not just tallying up the funds but devising new programs, structures and tech investment plans to help the company’s bottom line. A new study from Datarails finds that average CFOs are becoming better compensated for their work. The average CFO salary, from an analysis of SEC filings for 1,657 publicly traded U.S. companies, was $3.8 million in 2023, up 9% from 2022 and one of the highest in the C-suite. CEOs and CTOs are the only positions that make more, with the average CTO salary only slightly more at $3.9 million. But the CFO also has the worst job security in the C-suite. In the last five years, the average CFO was at a company for only 3.1 of them. Datarails found that 48% of the companies it included in the study—771—had at least one CFO turnover in the last five years. Twenty-two had four CFOs in five years, while 152 had three. Breaking it down by industry, the average utility company CFO is there just over two and a half years. “The CFO position has become less a destination and more a crucible,” the report says. “Success can launch careers to new heights.” And that is true for some: The report found 15 CFOs who were promoted to CEO at their company in 2023. And, the report says, this underscores the new power of the CFO’s position. While it can have tenuous security, it’s a real opportunity for leaders to be forged, proving their acumen in both finance and strategy, and eventually rising to the top. Joan Hilson, chief finance and operating officer of Signet Jewelers, knows all about building strategy to drive better operations and sales. After coming to the world’s largest diamond retail company in 2019 as part of a strategic overhaul, she reformulated the financial and operational arm of the company to operate better in today’s consumer reality. I talked to her about these moves, and an excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter. Forbes CFO will be taking time off for the holiday season. This is our last newsletter of 2024. We’ll be back in your inbox on Tuesday, January 7. Happy holidays! The Eccles Building in Washington, D.C., where the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Federal Open Market Committee are headquartered. In the run-up to the last Federal Reserve Open Market Committee meeting of the year, which begins today, indicators have been mixed. Inflation remains sticky, with last month’s consumer prices 2.7% above where they were in November 2023, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics last month. Core inflation—excluding food and energy costs—was 3.3% higher than a year ago. The CPI met analysts’ expectations, though it’s a tenth of a percentage point higher than October’s 2.6% inflation rate—but both are above the 2% Federal Reserve target. These figures show a high likelihood that the Fed will cut its target interest rate for the third straight time since September. According to CME FedWatch, 97% of economists predict a quarter percentage point cut, down to 4.25%. While the rate cut trend has continued, Forbes senior contributor Simon Moore writes that in 2025, the trend may slow down, especially if inflation doesn’t start coming down more. Inflation is only one piece of the puzzle—job growth and the overall economy are also taken into account—but persistent inflation held interest rates at the two-decade high of 5.25% for more than a year. The stock market had a big week as well, with the Nasdaq composite exceeding 20,000 for the first time ever on Wednesday. The inflation report, as well as big tech stocks and AI confidence, buoyed the market rally, and the index again exceeded 20,000 on Tuesday morning. But all companies did not have a good week. Chipmaker Nvidia found itself in correction territory Monday, posting a more than 1.6% loss—11% below its all-time closing high of $149 on November 7. While nothing new happened with Nvidia on Monday, the continued dip may be residual hesitancy based on Chinese authorities announcing last week an antitrust investigation into Nvidia for issues stemming from its 2020 acquisition of Israel’s Mellanox Technologies, writes Forbes senior contributor Dan Runkevicius. SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son delivers remarks alongside President-elect Donald Trump and his choice for Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort. Japan’s SoftBank announced a huge investment in the U.S. on Monday. At a joint event with President-elect Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort, SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son announced the tech funder would invest $100 billion in the United States over the next four years, doubling the $50 billion investment SoftBank made during Trump’s first term. Son said the investment will bring about 100,000 jobs in AI and related industries to the U.S. “President Trump is a double down president, I’m going to have to double down,” Son said at the joint press conference. However, Forbes’ Richard Nieva notes there could be an issue with that commitment: SoftBank doesn’t have $100 billion right now. Its market cap is close—$97 billion as of Monday, Nieva writes—and the commitment is for investments over four years, meaning there is time for SoftBank’s funds to grow. SoftBank’s commitment comes on the heels of many Big Tech executives kowtowing to the president-elect—and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman all announcing $1 million donations to Trump’s inaugural fund. Police place bullet casing markers outside the hotel in New York City after United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson was fatally shot December 4. Since the shooting death earlier this month of United HealthCare CEO Brian Thompson as he walked into the annual Investor Day meeting in New York City, C-suites and boardrooms have been buzzing about executive security. While some companies have taken immediate measures like removing executive pictures and profiles from their websites, others are beginning to look at actual security details to protect the executives—something that just over a quarter currently have. But executive security is a costly proposition. Last year, Apple spent $820,300 on personal security for CEO Tim Cook, as well as $1.6 million on his private aircraft travel, writes Forbes’ Kelly Phillips Erb. However, she writes, there are ways for companies to get tax breaks on executive security. According to tax law, essential security measures for an executive—those provided in response to “bona fide business-oriented security concerns” that are provided as part of a plan pursuant to independent security studies—can be deducted by the company. (The SEC considers executive security to be reportable compensation, so they are disclosed.) Signet Jewelers Chief Financial and Operating Officer Joan Hilson. The fine jewelry industry has seen big changes recently, and Joan Hilson has been there to lead the way. Since 2019, she’s been CFO of Signet Jewelers, the world’s largest diamond jewelry retailer that is the parent company of Kay Jewelers, Jared, Zales, Blue Nile and Banter by Piercing Pagoda. She was recently promoted to chief financial and operating officer. I spoke to Hilson about how Signet Jewelers’ new strategies, both before and since the Covid-19 pandemic, have helped the company cut costs and increase sales. This conversation has been edited for length, continuity and clarity. A longer version is available here. When you first came to Signet in 2019, you focused on restructuring the finance department. Why was this important, and how did you do it? Hilson: I joined Signet in 2019, as we were working to transform the overall company. The transformation was cultural, strategic and, at its core, financial. My job was to link arms with our [then-]CEO Gina Drosos and the senior leadership team to be one of the key drivers and an architect of our future growth plans. When I came in as CFO, Gina started to disassemble some of the top-down culture that needed to change. I was excited to dig into the financial side, the forecasting, and bring goals and an understanding of those goals to the team so that they can realize what we needed to achieve to drive a strong framework for our future. We rolled out [strategic plan] “Path to Brilliance” in 2018, and because of the progress we made on those goals, we accelerat[ed] to the “Inspiring Brilliance” strategy, which focused on enhanced capabilities. One of the things that I focused on as the financial leader of the company was: What do we need to do to drive top line growth and recognize that our banners span 80% of U.S. jewelry customers. By focusing on our core banners, we can drive that top line growth, which was critical to our strategies. We also focused on expanding our operating margins. That came along with developing a high-margin jewelry services business, which can take care of all of our customer needs, in terms of love and care for their jewelry. Along with that, we focused on a cost-savings initiative that drove out costs over $900 million since 2019. We did that by not just focusing on cutting costs that the customer doesn’t see or care about, but by changing processes and understanding how to simplify and what’s important to the overall growth of our business. Those efficiencies included the labor scheduling model we have in our stores. We have over 2,500 stores. With investments in data and analytics, we were able to bring forward labor scheduling models that enabled the strongest jewelry consultants to be in the stores at peak hours. We were able to look at locations by hour and by jewelry consultant to understand the best productivity opportunities. Our sales per labor hour is a key metric. [It] was up more than 40% versus pre-pandemic. It was a huge improvement in leveraging analytics and labor scheduling to serve our customers ultimately in a better way. The next big focus was our real estate strategy. Over my tenure, we closed over 1,000 stores. We did reopen stores in optimal locations for our business, but the net was a 630 [store] closure. It improved our gross margin leverage by 400 basis points by optimizing our fleet and then putting stores in the right locations within markets. We also moved from in-mall to off-mall to better serve some of the smaller markets in the U.S. While doing that, the savings that we were able to achieve we invest[ed] in our digital capabilities. With this change, we were able to grow our e-commerce business significantly over the five years from 2019. We went from 5% penetration to 20% penetration. We brought Signet into the digital and technology world and proved that jewelry and high-price-point items can be purchased online. In general, consumer spending across many categories has been down for about the last year and a half. How has Signet made it through that? We have a value-oriented consumer and they are looking for a value in whatever they purchase. We brought an assortment that can speak to the different economic circumstances of our customers. We have a portfolio that spans from Banter by Piercing Pagoda to Diamonds Direct and Blue Nile at the accessible luxury end of our business. Within each of those banners, we have good, better, best price points based on overall design and content of precious metals. We’ve addressed it with assortment architecture and bringing our customers price points that serve wherever they are at that time of year or their circumstance.

Just in time for Christmas - and you get three free games When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Meta Quest 3S and Apple Vision Pro sure have hogged the VR limelight this year, but there's another headset that I think you should know about if you're shopping for a new mixed-reality device this Christmas. The Pico 4 Ultra launched only a few months ago, and it has some specs that are even more powerful than the Meta Quest 3. I was scrolling through Christmas-time deals at Amazon today when I came across its first-ever major discount - to the tune of a £60 reduction. That means that for a limited time, you can get the Pico 4 Ultra for just £469 at Amazon, which is the same price as the 512GB Quest 3. Because this VR headset is so new, the discount isn't all you get. You can still make the most of the Pico 4 Ultra's launch bundle, which gets you three free games (try saying that a few times out loud) with your purchase for no extra cost. Those games are packing serious heat: Blade & Sorcery, Pistol Whip, and Synth Riders, as well as a one-month subscription to VRChat Plus. That's quite tempting versus the one free Batman game you get when buying the Quest 3. Pico 4 Ultra 256GB + 3 Free Games + VRC+ Subscription | £529 £469 at AmazonSave £60 - This is the first time that the Pico 4 Ultra has dropped in price since its launch earlier in the year. Its pre-order bonus offer is still available, which means you can get three free games with your purchase, two of which are Blade & Sorcery and Pistol Whip, which are two of the best VR games ever made in my opinion. Buy it if ✅ You want a powerful standalone VR headset✅ You want something that's better than the Meta Quest 3✅ You want to play on PC✅ You want three free games to get you started Don't buy it if: ❌ You'd prefer a Meta Quest headset❌ You already own a PS5 Now priced at the same level as the Meta Quest 3, the Pico 4 Ultra finds itself in a straight shootout. I've had the good fortune of reviewing both headsets and although both are plenty capable of giving you mixed reality goodness and VR gaming fun, there's one I'd probably choose over the other. Pico 4 Ultra has 12GB of RAM, more than the 8GB you get in the Meta Quest 3. In addition, it has a really lightweight feel on your head because the head strap you get out of the box is a bit more substantial than the stock one Meta gives you. This spreads the weight a bit better, meaning it's more comfortable to wear for longer sessions. One of my biggest concerns with Pico's OS was that it might have a smaller library of games than the popular Quest options. While that is true, I was surprised that the 4 Ultra still had access to lots of great titles, and many of the best VR games are present. In standalone mode, the Pico 4 Ultra uses the same processor as the Quest 3, the Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2, but with its beefier memory, larger battery, faster Wi-Fi, and crystal clear frontal cameras, I'd probably pick the Pico 4 Ultra. You may think the opposite is true when you consider the Quest 3's increased 512GB storage or slightly wider field of view, but I'd disagree. Memory makes more of a difference to gaming performance in a VR headset, and a longer battery life will be a big factor for you. VR games are bizarely small in terms of storage sizes, and in over a year of owning my Quest 3, I've not come close to filling up its 512GB drive. Of course, if you're on a budget, you might want to opt for the cheapest alternative, which will be the Meta Quest 3S. It also shares the same chipset as the headsets above, although does cut some corners with other internal specs. Still, it only costs £299, so if you need to keep costs down at this time of year (I wouldn't blame you), that headset might suit you better.

Title: AppLovin has rocketed to a $100 billion valuation. Some industry insiders are skeptical its run can last.

Shares in the mobile ads and gaming company AppLovin have been running wild — and advertising industry insiders have a lot of questions. AppLovin entered the Nasdaq 100 in November, with its market value surpassing the $100 billion milestone and shares up more than 780% so far this year. It's a remarkable ascent for any company, but especially for one that had flown fairly under the radar until recently, even within the ad industry itself. At its current valuation, AppLovin dwarfs even The Trade Desk, long considered adtech's star performer, which has a market capitalization of around $65 billion. AppLovin — which helps app developers make money through advertising and find new users through ads — has grown its share to 42% of the mobile gaming market, per analysts at Piper Sandler. But there's one key new development that's driving its stunning stock run: e-commerce. Bullish analysts say AppLovin has room to grow further and do for e-commerce marketers what it has for gaming companies, taking on Meta in the process. "In all my years, it's the best product I've ever seen released by us, fastest growing, but it's still in pilot," AppLovin CEO Adam Foroughi said of the company's new e-commerce product on an earnings call last month. With its stock riding high, some industry insiders also think AppLovin could make a transformative acquisition that would make it a household name. Still, others in the ad industry say AppLovin's business model deserves some skepticism amid its meteoric rise. 22V Research analyst John Roque wrote in a recent note that AppLovin was the most overbought stock in the Russell 3000. AppLovin declined to comment on a list of detailed questions about its business. Wall Street's interest in AppLovin soared this year as the company unveiled a plan to go after a new target customer outside the mobile gaming community: e-commerce advertisers. The move opened up a total addressable ad revenue opportunity of around $120 billion, two to three times the size of the $40 to $50 billion mobile games user acquisition market, according to Macquarie Equity senior analyst Tim Nollen. Nollen recently raised the firm's target share price for AppLovin to $450 from $270, citing its e-commerce push. Cody Pfloker, chief marketing and revenue officer for Jones Road Beauty, which is testing AppLovin, said direct-to-consumer advertisers are excited by the prospect of a new player in the market. "Meta has been the dominant customer acquisition channel for brands and while other platforms have come up like TikTok a few years ago, none are either as efficient or scalable," Pfloker said. "Nothing has been able to dethrone Meta." AppLovin says it can reach a potential audience of 1.4 billion daily active users across mobile apps and connected-TV devices — an audience comparable to Meta or Google's apps. Pfloker said part of the appeal is that e-commerce advertisers can easily repurpose their Meta ads into ads for AppLovin's mobile games and other apps. AppLovin is only inviting e-commerce advertisers that spend upward of $20,000 a day on Meta ads to try its product, and it's incentivizing some of those buyers with $10,000 ad credits, multiple industry insiders told BI. They, like some others in this story, requested anonymity to preserve business relationships; their identities are known to BI. Prescient AI, a marketing measurement company, ran an analysis in October that found AppLovin delivered a 1.5 times higher return on ad spend for its customers than Meta and Google Adwords, on average. "A pretty startling thing is happening," said Will Holtz, VP of strategy and operations at Prescient AI. The top spenders are spending 25% to 30% of their budgets on AppLovin, he said, something Prescient hasn't seen before on a new channel, except for something like TV where people bulk up spending over the holidays. What's more, Holtz added: "They're spending incremental dollars; they're not just shifting budget away from channels like Meta." It's worth noting that the ads are full-screen and can't be skipped, which also likely boosts some performance metrics compared to other platforms. The results are also early and could fluctuate as more advertisers come on board. Despite the enthusiasm from some customers, others in the digital ad community have raised concerns about AppLovin. Some industry insiders attribute AppLovin's performance to its cornering of every part of the mobile app ad transaction. AppLovin operates AppDiscovery, the technology that advertisers use to buy the ads; the MAX mediation technology developers use to sell their ads; and the ALX exchange that connects the two. It also has Adjust, its ad measurement platform, and AXON, an AI engine designed to improve the performance of its ads. This could give AppLovin a unique view of the market and allow it to see what different advertisers and buying platforms are bidding. Theoretically, AppLovin could use this intelligence to refine its own ad bidding strategies. "It's one company for monetizing your app, growing your userbase, and then grading its own homework," a mobile ad veteran told BI. "They say there's a firewall and 'we don't talk,' but it's hard to prove otherwise." If that sounds familiar, it's because it's similar to how people often describe the approach that helped Google dominate advertising on the web. A judge in Google's adtech antitrust trial is currently weighing whether that strategy, as well as its use of other auction tactics, amounted to Google operating an illegal monopoly. Google denies this and has said the adtech market is fiercely competitive and that its innovations have brought benefits to consumers, publishers, and advertisers. Jeromy Sonne, the founder of marketing AI technology company Simbiant, has been monitoring the early AppLovin e-commerce results. He said he'd seen an "extremely high correlation" between when AppLovin sees a spike in conversions and when Meta sees an increase in ad spend. He said he hadn't seen a similar trend when comparing Meta and Google or AppLovin and Google. He said that made him wonder if AppLovin was driving real incremental value or whether its campaigns were just reaching the exact same audience as Meta in some way. He said he'd also seen a "concerning overlap" where Shopify sales purportedly driven by AppLovin have a very high geographic overlap with where Meta ad website traffic was coming from. Separately, Prescient AI's analysis found that brands spending between 25% to 30% of their digital ad budgets on AppLovin acquired fewer incremental new customers than brands in the 5% to 10% range. While reacquiring some old customers isn't necessarily a bad thing, the finding raises questions about the appropriate level of spending advertisers should devote to AppLovin, Prescient AI's Holtz said. Other advertisers have questioned why AppLovin doesn't share granular data about exactly where their ads ran. "It's a little bit of a black box — we have no idea where our ads are appearing," Pfloker said of AppLovin. "There's a lot to be excited about, but there's a lot to be skeptical about." AppLovin recently paid more than $150 million to add developer Zynga's portfolio of games to its MAX ad exchange as part of Zynga's divestment of its adtech platform Chartboost, three people familiar with the matter told BI. This boosted AppLovin's already huge audience of gamers. A spokesperson for Zynga owner Take-Two declined to comment. Some in the industry think AppLovin could make an even bigger move. The company recently sold $3.5 billion in bonds, which Bloomberg reported were to pay down debt "and for general corporate purposes." Could that include an acquisition? Alex Merutka, an early AppLovin employee who now runs his own digital marketing company, Craftsman+, thinks AppLovin should make a bid for a social network — a particularly valuable sector of apps because users tend to be logged in, visit often, and share useful data. People who use mobile games don't usually hand over data like phone numbers or email addresses, vital pieces of information for marketers to help connect their ads to outcomes, and to retarget users with ads. AppLovin is already trading at a larger market capitalization than Snap, Pinterest, and Reddit combined. Years ago, Snap held informal, early-stage talks about potentially acquiring AppLovin, a person familiar with the matter told BI. Perhaps the roles could be reversed this time around. While Snap posted a revenue growth bounceback in its latest quarter, it's struggled to keep momentum amid fierce competition from the likes of TikTok. AppLovin could theoretically help optimize Snap's ad platform for performance advertisers to better compete with Google and Meta. "If Adam was in control, Snap could be a $100 billion business — a $200 billion, $300 billion company — and AppLovin would be stronger too," Merutka said, referring to AppLovin CEO Adam Foroughi. "There's a lot of opportunity there." However, AppLovin execs said onstage at the Nasdaq Investor Conference earlier this month that M&A wasn't a near-term priority and that the company was keeping a close eye on its head count and margins. "It's much harder than people realize, and it's exceptionally hard for a company that's structured like us," Foroughi said of M&A and the difficulty of absorbing different company cultures, according to a transcript provided by the market intelligence platform AlphaSense.

Title: What's Happening With Broadcom Stock?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/12/17/whats-happening-with-broadcom-stock/
Time Published: 2024-12-17T14:07:18Z
Full Content:
SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA - DECEMBER 12: A sign is posted in front of a Broadcom office on December 12, ... [+] 2024 in San Jose, California. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ: AVGO), a semiconductor, enterprise software, and security solutions provider, has seen its stock surge over 40% in a week. This can be attributed to better than expected earnings and outlook, followed by stock upgrades from some of the large Wall Street institutions. Also see, Buy, Sell, Or Hold Bitcoin? Broadcom recently reported its Q4 fiscal 2024 results (fiscal ends in October), with revenues of $14.05 billion and earnings of $1.42 per share, versus the consensus estimates of $14.09 billion and $1.38, respectively. Broadcom is seeing a stellar demand for its AI products, a trend expected to continue in the coming years. Let’s dive deeper into the company’s recent performance and the impact on its stock price. Separately, if you want upside with a smoother ride than an individual stock, consider the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P, and clocked >91% returns since inception. Broadcom’s revenue of 14.05 billion in Q4 was up a stellar 51% y-o-y. This can partly be attributed to the contribution from VMware, which it acquired for $69 billion last year. Apart from VMware, Broadcom’s AI products contributed to its top-line growth. The company’s AI revenue in fiscal 2024 stood at $12.2 billion, reflecting a whopping 220% y-o-y growth, driven by strong demand for its AI XPUs (Broadcom’s custom AI accelerators) and Ethernet products. Broadcom is benefiting from the generative AI boom, with its wide suite of networking and storage solutions, cybersecurity, and semiconductor offerings. Broadcom also announced that it’s developing AI chips with three large cloud companies, which reportedly include Google and Meta. The company’s outlook of $14.6 billion in Q1 fiscal 2025 also reflects a strong 22% y-o-y growth. Not only did the company post strong revenues in Q4, its adjusted operating margin expanded 90 bps y-o-y to 62.7%. Higher revenues and margin expansion resulted in the bottom line of $1.42 on an adjusted basis, versus $1.11 in the prior-year quarter. Also, look at What's Behind The 500% Rise In RGTI Stock? Admirably, AVGO stock has generated better returns than the broader market in each of the last 4 years. Returns for the stock were 56% in 2021, -13% in 2022, 104% in 2023, and 104% so far this year. Similarly, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, is considerably less volatile. And it has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride, as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Broadcom’s solid growth for its AI products and guidance prompted an upward revision for its stock price by several Wall Street analysts. That said, most of the estimates are now met, after a large 40% move seen in a week. At its current levels of $250, AVGO stock now trades at 23x trailing revenues, versus the stock’s average P/S ratio of 5x over the last three years. Now, the company’s acquisition of VMware, the massive opportunity in generative AI with its chips, as well as networking products, and strong profitability does warrant a meaningful upward revision in valuation multiple. After its recent rally, AVGO has now become the eighth stock to exceed the $1 trillion market capitalization. Notably, the $226 average of analysts price estimate for AVGO stock implies that it’s now fully valued. While AVGO stock looks like it is fully valued, it is helpful to see how Broadcom’s Peers fare on metrics that matter.

Title: Meta Quest 3S review: “Maybe the best entry-level VR device ever created”

Time Published: 2024-12-17T11:18:38Z

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The Meta Quest 3S isn’t like other Lite hardware, because it actually feels like the flagship Quest 3 and you really need to look to see the differences. This will give most players everything in a VR headset they’ll want, and it’s not going to break the bank like this technology usually does. In short, it continues the mission of the Meta Quest 2 by bringing great standalone gaming, mixed reality, and a huge wealth of games and apps to the masses at a reasonable price point. Approachable price tag Huge library of games A lot of spec similarities with the Quest 3 and… …It actually feels like an affordable Quest 3 Controller tracking isn’t great Battery life is fine Fresnel lenses do feel like a downgrade No audio jack Why you can trust GamesRadar+ Our experts review games, movies and tech over countless hours, so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about our reviews policy. I’m going to level with you and admit that, even for someone like me who has tried a number of different VR headsets through the years, it can be hard to tell the difference between the Meta Quest 3S and its full-fat sibling. Yes, there are a few obvious comparisons you can make, but for their respective prices, the Quest 3S does a very impressive imitation. And that’s a good thing. A lot of the time an “S” device that comes in cheaper than a flagship model feels half-baked because the manufacturer really wants you to spend money on the more expensive version. The Quest 3 is one of the best VR headsets out there at the moment, but it didn’t exactly continue the Quest 2’s mission of making virtual reality technology affordable for all. The Meta Quest 3S remedies that because it comes in two sizes (128GB and 256GB) and costs only $299.99 / £289.99 or $399.99 / £379. That lower MSRP is the same price as the Quest 2 before it was discontinued. Pandemic launch or not, that headset made a name for itself by making a mainstream VR device approachable, and the Quest 3S may see major success for the same reason. Not only does the Meta Quest 3S feel like the proper spiritual successor to the Quest 2, but it sort of looks like one too. It has the same rectangular look with sharper corners that make it look a bit more refined. If it weren’t for an upgraded frontal camera module, the Quest 3S would look eerily similar to the Meta Quest 2. For a “Lite” model of the Meta Quest 3, it does make me laugh that Zuck’s engineers have only managed to shave one measly gram off the Quest 3’s weight. It’s the equivalent of taking a feather out of your inventory in Skyrim and suddenly not being over-encumbered, and it’s hilarious that Meta is actually marketing it for its “lightweight design”. Nice try. The Quest 3S comes with the same cleverly designed head strap as the Quest 3. It’s definitely a basic, stock option, but it does the job with a top velcro strap that can be adjusted to your head size, as well as some loops around the back to tighten or loosen the fit. Thankfully, the design of the Quest 3S has been thoughtfully executed, since the best Meta Quest accessories made for the original will fit either headset - no need to buy specially fitted ones for either device. Out of the box, the facial interfaces of both feel identical, with some fabric upholstery and quite plush cushioning for your cheeks and forehead. It’s no surprise that the Quest 3S connects to a charger or gaming PC through USB-C, although it misses out on the Quest 3’s 3.5mm audio jack, which is a shame. I’m not sure this would cost too much more to add in 2024, and since budget buyers are far more likely to use it than wireless or Bluetooth headsets, it feels like a glaring omission. Thankfully, you get the additional onboard buttons for when your controllers inevitably run out of battery. Some volume adjustment keys and a handy action button lie on the headset’s underside, which should always be present on standalone headsets like this. There’s also the standard power button on the 3S’s left-hand side. Even when you’re looking at the spec sheets comparing the Quest 3 and 3S, you need a trained eye to figure out the differences, because, in truth, there aren’t many. Both feature the same Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 processor, which is one of the biggest wins of this more affordable headset. It’d be all too easy for Meta to scale back on power for the lighter model, but with so much competition in the VR world at the moment, the use of this processor feels like they’re rolling up their sleeves. The Pico 4 Ultra also launched this year, touting that same APU but even more RAM than the Quest 3. Despite Meta’s financial footwork to get around it when the Quest 3S launched, the Pico 4 Ultra is still a serious rival in Europe, so this processor is more important than a lot of shoppers realize. If you think about it, the Quest 3S gets you the processing power of the Quest 3, the Pico 4 Ultra, and even the new HTC Vive Focus Vision for undeniably cheaper than any of those devices. The latter will set you back $999 / £999, and although it’s designed to harness the power of the best graphics cards, that’s still a massive win for people buying the Quest 3S. The biggest talking point for most is that the Quest 3’s pancake lenses are missing from the Quest 3S. For me, this is perhaps the most noticeable change when using either headset. The wider area of focus really does make a difference in gaming and mixed-reality menu hopping. Combine that with a lower per-eye resolution, and the Quest 3S does start to feel more like a budget option. Still, with the same 8GB of RAM, integrated spatial audio speakers, and variable refresh rate, the Quest 3S has more than enough to make first-time VR buyers swoon. Another spec disparity of note is that the Quest 3 has an integrated depth sensor which can help with passthrough clarity as well as room tracking and mapping. The Quest 3S omits this, instead using a few InfaRed projectors to map out a room and your position in it. I didn’t notice less accurate tracking in my side-by-side tests of the 3 and 3S, but it might be worth taking into consideration if you play in a more sensitive area of your home with lots of breakable goodies near you. Similarly, if you play in darker rooms, the Quest 3’s depth sensor might be better for low-lighting conditions. Battery life is technically better on the Quest 3S, despite its mAh being smaller. Depending on what you use either headset for in one session, you’ll get a similar 2-hour battery life without a pro headstrap. I’ve found just over 2 hours for either is an accurate statement, with gaming being the more intensive activity that brings it down closer to that baseline. Neither is particularly impressive in terms of lifespan because they’re just short enough to feel like an inconvenience. If you don’t charge up between uses, you’re probably going to be cutting your next Power Wash Sim session short. What is constantly disappointing is that the controllers have an even worse battery life, and will often run out of charge between uses. For that reason, I can highly recommend charging docks to keep the controllers ready to go for your next session - unless you have an unlimited budget for AA batteries. I want to state right now that the Quest 3S is a very impressive VR gaming device for the money. Most of the performance notes I have are about the few times I paid attention to the man behind the curtain, noticing where the Quest 3 does things better. That’s probably going to be the case for most “Lite” model reviews because it’s where the natural comparisons are going to sit. That said, it doesn’t mean the Quest 3S isn’t worth buying. I’m really looking for the nitty gritty details I’ll mention below, and I’ll admit that they were quite tricky to find. Normally, I wouldn’t actually compare two devices so closely when they have a two-hundred-dollar price disparity, but the fact I feel those comparisons are valid says a lot of good things about the Quest 3S on its own. Even five years ago, the idea of an “entry-level” VR headset was pretty alien. The idea of a headset under $450 with full-color passthrough, genuine standalone gaming power, and loads of mixed-reality potential was so out of reach that it was a fantasy. For the first few weeks of testing this headset, I wasn’t actually sure what I was going to say in this review. Unless I really looked for the slight differences between the 3 and 3S, I couldn’t find them. I could boot up a game and play for hours without any immersion-breaking performance hiccups to give away that I was using a “budget” device. Especially if you’re not used to playing VR games, this headset will be very capable of making your jaw drop. Like the Quest 2 before it, it can immerse you to a degree that you’ll come out of a longer session and need to take a second look at your real hands to know you’re out of the Matrix. The resolution per eye may be weaker than the Quest 3 512GB, but when it’s that close to your eyeballs you don’t need to suspend your disbelief like you might need to on a big TV these days. In truth, it took me diving into the same levels in both headsets to really understand the weak points of the 3S. The Quest 3’s colors and display seem more vivid and colorful overall. Maybe this was the pancake lenses showing their worth, or the fact that two LCD displays are better than one. Perhaps it was a combination of these things and the Quest 3’s boosted resolution. Regardless, things just seem more focused, and colors appear clearer on Quest 3. The Quest 3S still does a great job though, making it easy to spot the tiny bits of grime that still needed washing away in Power Wash Sim. I must say, both headsets come up a bit short in Blade & Sorcery Nomad when it comes to jaggy lines - something the Pico 4 Ultra has them both beat on. Doing more formalized tests really solidifies the value of extra RAM in that headset, especially because environments and details in surroundings pop in much more noticeably on the Quest 3S. Controller tracking is also a bit disappointing, which makes some weapons in the game unusable. The Pico 4 Ultra suffered similar issues, but I felt much more immersed in my sequences of fantasy mass murder on Pico’s headset than I do on the Quest 3S. The increased resolution of the Quest 3 really shows its worth in Asgard’s Wrath 2, with even its softer, more illustrative art style appearing clearer on the flagship model. To a layman, these environments will still be plenty expressive on the 3S, but you definitely notice a difference with some beefed-up resolution and an extra display panel. The same great audio quality from the Quest 3 carries over to the 3S though, so I can’t make any complaints about how immersive and high-quality games sound. I’m not one for mixed-reality spatial computing, but I did a bit more testing with this headset than I usually do. I can see it being a big draw for people who like the look of the Apple Vision Pro but are attracted to a much more affordable device. Hand tracking works fairly well for the most part, allowing me to pinch my fingers to interact, or get physically closer to a virtual menu and use them like I would a touch screen. The fact that Meta's Quest OS windows now operate within real spaces is pretty clever. Going upstairs in a friend’s house, then looking down at the ground, only to see the headset’s app library window still open through the floor was a bit wild, and something people are bound to get a kick out of. Watching content on YouTube and streaming services was where I found the Quest 3 to be a much more versatile option because focus is such a priority for big virtual cinema-like screens. With Pancake lenses, you definitely get a wider area of a virtual cinema screen in clarity without needing to move your head. Similarly, the Quest 3S’s narrower FOV makes itself known in these instances where you aren’t fully immersed since it can be harder to zone out the black borders around your content. Either way, PSVR 2 and the detail and vivid colors its OLED displays can throw at your eyeballs is much better. Not least because the inky black surroundings of any virtual screen in cinematic mode help you to feel more immersed. Keep in mind that I’m making these comparisons from the point of someone who has tried lots of VR headsets and that I’ve really been looking for holes to pick in the 3S. Even five years ago, the idea of an “entry-level” VR headset was pretty alien. The idea of a headset under $450 with full-color passthrough, genuine standalone gaming power, and loads of mixed-reality potential was so out of reach that it was a fantasy. The Quest 3S has all of that, and the fact I can nitpick those features in a device at this price point is excellent. If you haven’t yet owned a modern, standalone VR headset, this is a fantastic option that gets you so many of the Quest 3’s software tricks and lots of its internals for a decent price. Enthusiasts who have played a lot of VR games before, on either a Quest 2 or PC VR headset, will probably want more than the 3S can provide, so I’d be inclined to recommend the full-fat Quest 3, or the Pico 4 Ultra. If you do have more budget to play with, maybe consider a PC option like the HTV Vive Focus Vision - not least because my concerns with how Meta collects our data still make me hesitant to recommend its hardware (see my Meta Quest Pro review). Still, this is maybe the best entry-level VR device ever created. Both in looks and spirit, it’s the spitting image of its father, the Meta Quest 2. However, with updated internals and software perks to its name, it’s potentially more worth a buy than its parent ever was. I tested the Meta Quest 3S for just over a month before writing this review. In that time I’ve used it for plenty of VR gaming, as well as watching some streaming content and general spatial computing tasks. I played a lot of Blade & Sorcery Nomad, Power Wash Sim VR, and Asgard’s Wrath 2 on the Quest 3S to test its gaming potential. To compare it with the Quest 3, I loaded up the same levels in each game and played them one after the other to take notes.

2024 Marked by Strategic Repositioning to Spatial Core AI and Cloud Based Revenues, Significant DoD Contracts, and Positioning Toward Revenue Growth and Profitability NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / December 17, 2024 / The Glimpse Group, Inc. ("Glimpse") (NASDAQ:VRAR)(FSE:9DR), a diversified Immersive Technology platform company providing enterprise-focused Virtual Reality ("VR"), Augmented Reality ("AR") and Spatial Computing software and services, today issued a letter to shareholders from its President & CEO, Lyron Bentovim, summarizing key Glimpse developments for Calendar Year 2024. Dear Shareholders: 2024 was a transformational year for Glimpse, in which we made significant strides in our strategic transition to focus on providing enterprise-scale Spatial Computing, Cloud and AI driven Immersive middleware software and solutions ("Spatial Core") - led by our subsidiary company Brightline Interactive. This successful transition included major contracts with leading U.S. Department of Defense ("DoD") and other large entities, while working directly with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Cesium and many others. In parallel, we streamlined our organizational structure and reached a point where we are cash flow profitable from operations. We achieved this milestone without raising capital and while maintaining a clean balance sheet with no debt, converts or preferreds. In fact, we expect our cash balance on December 31, 2024 to match and potentially exceed our cash balance on September 30, 2024 - the first time that has occurred in our history as a public company from internal operations only. The Immersive industry itself also made important progress in 2024, with major initiatives and products announced by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta (NASDAQ:META), Nvidia, Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Samsung (KS:005930), Snap and others. These bode well for the Immersive industry in general and for Glimpse in particular. Spatial Core Summary: In 2023 we commenced on a strategic transition, focusing our investment on Spatial Core. This transition was largely completed during 2024 and Spatial Core is now Glimpse's primary growth engine and value driver. Spatial Core has tremendous potential and has gained strong traction during the year. We are working with some of the leading companies in the world to develop the Immersive middleware that takes in huge amounts of 2D data, creates detailed and life-like digital twins in 3D and then on top of that 3D data makes complex computations inside the digital twin environment while also adding important utility functions, all via the Cloud, in large scale and in real time.Spatial Core is highly relevant and powerful in industries where there is complex 2D data that can be utilized far more effectively in a 3D setting with multiple use cases in Enterprises, Manufacturing, Engineering/Architecture, Oil/Gas, Robotics as well as in Government and the Military.AI is a key element in Spatial Core:Automate the generation of digital twin environments - 2D to 3D, utilizing machine learning and computer vision.Generative AI inside a Spatial Environment - utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to ask functional questions about a descriptive environment. For example, "If I place a building in this location, will I be able to see the other building".Neuro Learning Networks - learn in an immersive environment by performing a function repeatedly, based on visual inputs, and then distribute that learning to all other participants. For example, robots learning to do complex tasks.These AI capabilities, combined with the vast and real time computing available via the Cloud, and delivered via 5G networks are transformative in our ability to create complex and powerful simulations and scenarios, in a cost effective, scalable and effective manner.I encourage you to view the Spatial Core webinar we hosted earlier this year: "The intersection of AI and Spatial Computing, bringing the power of bringing AI into the 3D world": https://www.webcaster4.com/Webcast/Page/2934/51186 Examples of Spatial Core traction include:Signed a $4MM+, 12-month contract with a Department of Defense entity for a Spatial Computing ecosystem, integrating AI workflows and accelerated compute for a variety of defense use-cases.Entered into a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the US Army Combat Capabilities Development Command, Command, Control, Communication, Computers, Cyber, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Center, to develop, assess and improve workflows to create and augment synthetic imagery for use in training and assessing AI and machine learning Machine learning algorithms.Extended partnership with a Fortune 500 government Systems Integrator for VR Training in Digital Twin Environments to a key U.S. government agency with over 45,000 employees on a mid six figure contract.Brightline Interactive, Cesium & NVIDIA teamed up at the GEOspatial INTelligence Symposium 2024 to introduce Brightline's Spatial Core which uses AI workflows for complex computations on top of real life data sets, enabling powerful real time, massive data driven, digital twin and simulation applications.Successfully Completed the Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the US Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division for the adaptation of immersive technologies.Completed a contract to support a major immersive technology hardware provider to accelerate their computing interfaces into GPU-enabled cloud, with streaming and visualization capabilities.We are at an advanced stage of securing several additional multi-million dollar Spatial Core contracts with multiple Government, DoD and large enterprise customers. The short-term aggregate value for these contracts is in the $5-10 million range.Each of these potential contracts has significant growth elements built into them that could lead to significant annual recurring software revenue once the original contracts have been successfully performed.Other Glimpse Entities Summary: In parallel to Spatial Core, our other Immersive businesses continued their positive momentum. Some examples:Foretell Reality entered into a 6-figure partnership with a large University to develop an AI-driven VR training system enabling students and trainees to learn various professional skills through conversation-centric simulations with an AI-based avatar in different immersive settings.Glimpse Learning entered into a two year, mid-six figure contract with the College of Staten Island CUNY ("CSI") Technology Incubator for the design, deployment and integration of a suite of immersive technologies in its new Innovation Hub. This is a cross Glimpse effort, with a significant software license componentIn recent months, we have experienced an increase in our revenues with Snap for AR 3D models and lenses.Sector 5 Digital ("S5D") entered into a 6-figure engagement with one of the world's largest architecture firms to visualize in AR the new business campus of a multinational retail company; a mid-six figure contract with a global water and hygiene infrastructure company for an augmented reality (AR) solution; and a mid-six figure contract with a global energy company for Immersive content.Glimpse Learning entered into a multi year, mid-six figure contract with a state district for Immersive education.Immersive Industry: While the Immersive industry, and Glimpse as a significant participant in it, has faced challenging headwinds over the past two years, we are now seeing and experiencing concrete positive growth indicators in both our business and the Immersive industry. We believe that the Immersive industry is poised for significant growth, driven by:Meta's VR gaming platform continues to grow, and their new Ray-Ban AI glasses have exceeded expectations, demonstrating consumer appetite for discreet wearable tech.Apple boldly entered the headset market with the Vision Pro, its initial Spatial headset, signaling their intent to lead the next digital era.Samsung's recent re-entry to the market, leveraging Google's new Immersive operating system, signals a competitive resurgence and further industry maturation.Perhaps the most significant development lies in Meta's "Orion" concept AR headset. This vision of seamlessly integrating digital experiences into the real world represents a fundamental shift in human-computer interaction. This vision is directly correlated with our vison for Spatial Core.Specifically, as it relates to Spatial Core, the following are key industry developments:Matured AR Cloud and Interoperable Standards for Enterprise and Government Workflows: standardized "AR Cloud"- open standards and protocols enable seamless interoperability, allowing different contractors, departments, and partners to integrate and share geospatial data, maintenance records, and situational guidance without being locked into proprietary ecosystems.Enhanced On-Device Spatial AI for Operational Efficiency and Security: Spatial computing devices can now perform advanced AI-driven tasks directly on their own hardware, enabling real-time environmental understanding, object recognition, and anomaly detection without constant cloud connectivity. Use cases: secure border monitoring, emergency response planning, infrastructure maintenance and technical troubleshooting.Industry-Grade Mixed Reality Headsets and Toolchains for Scalable Enterprise Solutions: High-performance mixed reality headsets, offering comfortable wearability, robust tracking, and industrial-grade durability, became standard gear in many professional fields letting enterprises rapidly create, deploy, and maintain applications - ranging from advanced training simulations for defense personnel to augmented production workflows for automotive manufacturing lines.We believe that these industry developments, coupled with ongoing technological advancements, position the Immersive industry for potential rapid adoption and substantial market expansion in upcoming years. 2025 Expectations:Looking forward, we expect overall revenues to be significantly higher in the coming quarters compared to the past year, resulting in above $3 million/Q revenue on average in the coming quarters. We expect that revenues for 2025 will be well above our revenues for 2024 (for reference, we previously disclosed that we expect our aggregate revenue for FY '25 - ending June 30, 2025 - to be in the $11-12 million range). This expected growth will be primarily driven by an increase in Spatial Core revenues, as well as potential growth in our other businesses.Our Gross Margin should continue to be in the 60-70% range.Post operational restructuring, our current operating cash expense base (pre revenue) is now less than $1 million per month.We expect to be cash flow positive and increase our cash balance throughout the upcoming calendar year, without the need for a capital raise.VRAR StockThe transformational and positive developments achieved in 2024 are not currently reflected in our stock price, creating what we believe is a very significant disconnect between our intrinsic value and our public company valuation.We have a strong position in the Immersive technology segment, AI and Cloud driven revenues, large enterprise and DoD customers, relationships with some of the most successful tech companies in the world, strong pipeline of growing revenues, high gross margins, positive expected cash flow, a clean balance sheet, 10 issued Immersive patents, etc. - yet we have an extremely low market cap and consistent selling pressure on the stock. In essence, we are an abandoned "Nano-Cap" but with top tier customers, partners, IP and technology in an exciting growth industry.The management, board and co-founders of the Company own approximately 33% of the outstanding shares. This group has never sold a share in the Company's history, even after the Glimpse's IPO in 2021, and is determined to maximize shareholder value. It is also a key reason why Glimpse continues to maintain a clean capital structure with no debt, no convertible debt and no preferred equity - a rarity in public companies of our size.This valuation disconnect has had, and continues to have, a substantial negative impact on our ability to execute on our growth strategy. As such, the Board of Directors of the Company is exploring various aggressive strategic options to enable the business to be in a position to invest in its growth while unlocking the value inherent in our business and/or assets and may pursue such options in the future.Summary Remarks We have made major strides over the past year in repositioning and restructuring Glimpse strategically and operationally. It's an exciting time for the Immersive industry, Glimpse is positioned as a leading provider of enterprise Immersive software and services, and we are poised for revenue growth and cash profitability. However, this is not reflected in our stock price, to the great detriment of our growth potential and shareholders. Going forward, we are going to continue our focus on profitable growth and in parallel aggressively explore all strategic options with the goal of unlocking the value of our business and/or underlying assets. I thank you all for your interest in and support of Glimpse, and wish you all a nice holiday season and a happy and healthy 2025. Lyron L.

Title: SoftBank’s $100 Billion Promise To Trump Is More Than Its Entire Market Cap
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardnieva/2024/12/16/softbank-trump-masayoshi-son-100-billion/
Time Published: 2024-12-17T00:35:35Z
Full Content:
The Japanese tech conglomerate has assets, like a majority stake in British chip company Arm, but hasn’t detailed how it will pony up. SoftBank announced a $100 billion commitment to U.S. projects over the span of Trump's presidency. On Monday, SoftBank Group CEO Masayoshi Son and President-elect Donald Trump jointly announced a bold commitment: The Japanese tech conglomerate aims to invest $100 billion in U.S. projects over the next four years. It was a glitzy pledge from a global tech leader, teaming up with the incoming president with a promise to create at least 100,000 new American jobs in artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies. The announcement eclipses a similar one Son made in 2016 as Trump first took office — a $50 billion pledge and 50,000 jobs. “President Trump is a double down president,” Son said during a press conference at Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s private residence in Palm Beach, Florida. “I’m going to have to double down.” There’s just one hitch: SoftBank doesn’t actually have $100 billion at the moment. As of market close on Monday, its entire market cap was $97 billion, and it has $29 billion in cash on hand. It’s unclear how the company would finance its pledge and Son didn’t bother to detail how during its announcement. The commitment is over the span of Trump’s presidency, so SoftBank will have years to make good on its promise. The company did fulfill its 2016 vow of $50 billion, with investments in dozens of companies including Slack and DoorDash. It’s more difficult to determine if it created that number of jobs, and the company did not provide an estimate at the end of Trump’s last term. SoftBank didn’t respond to a request for comment. The company’s most valuable asset is a majority stake in Arm Holdings, the British semiconductor company that went public last year. Arm’s market cap is currently $152.6 billion, with SoftBank’s roughly 90% stake valued at $137.3 billion. If liquidated, it would easily cover the company’s commitment. It’s unlikely, of course, that SoftBank would sell off its entire stake. Offloading large amounts of stock would probably cause the share price to crater. It could use its Arm stock as leverage to take out debt that would finance this commitment; but SoftBank has already taken out $8 billion in margin loans against its Arm stock. In reaching into the Arm piggy bank, SoftBank doesn’t want to repeat missteps it took with Alibaba. In 2000, SoftBank invested $20 million in the Chinese ecommerce company, which went public in 2014 in the largest tech IPO ever, raising $25 billion. SoftBank reportedly owned 24% of the company at the time — a stake that dwindled to 7% in 2022, and down to half a percent by last May. SoftBank’s announcement comes as several tech executives have tried to curry favor with Trump as he returns to power. In the last few days, Facebook parent Meta, Amazon and OpenAI have reportedly promised to donate $1 million each to Trump’s inauguration fund. With key supporters like Tesla CEO Elon Musk and venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, Silicon Valley has struck a different tone from when Trump first took office four years ago. Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg recently made a visit to Mar-a-Lago, and Google CEO Sundar Pichai reportedly has a visit in the works. SoftBank is best known for its Vision Fund, a $100 billion venture fund it announced in 2017 for investing in tech companies worldwide, with half the funds raised from the sovereign wealth funds of Middle East countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. But the Vision Fund came to be known for misplaced bets, including the ill-fated coworking real estate company WeWork, and Softbank posted an $18 billion loss. In 2020, the activist investor Elliott Management bought a $2.5 billion stake in the Vision Fund and pushed for restructuring and more transparency. By the time Softbank set out to raise more money for a Vision Fund 2, the company had trouble courting investors because of the first fund’s issues. In trying to hit the $100 billion mark, the company could potentially count already-announced commitments to its tally. For example, Softbank reportedly invested another $1.5 billion in OpenAI last month through an employee tender offer. In May, the Japanese company said it would commit $9 billion a year to AI investments, though it didn’t specify where it would make its bets. Trump, who described Son as “one of the most accomplished business leaders of our time,” didn’t seem worried about where the money would come from, and even pushed for more. “I’ve looked at their books and they do have the possibility of doing more,” Trump said Monday. “I’m going to ask them to do a little bit more.” He then challenged Son to double his promise again to $200 billion. While remaining noncommittal, Son laughed and said he would “try to make it happen.” “He’s a great negotiator,” he said. Additional reporting by Iain Martin.

Title: Nvidia Stock Limps To Correction Territory As AI Leader’s Post-Election Slump Deepens

Longtime Wall Street favorite Nvidia extended a rare down stretch, as shares of the artificial intelligence colossus slipped into correction territory, a ding that comes as Nvidia’s trillion-dollar peers enjoy a robust period of gains. A Nvidia display in Shanghai. Nvidia stock fell 1.7% Monday to $132, its lowest end-of-day share price since Oct. 15. That’s 11% below the stock’s all-time closing high of $149 set Nov. 7, officially heading into a correction. Monday’s losses moved against a broader rally for technology stocks, with the Nasdaq index gaining 1.2% to a new record. And shares of each of the six other most valuable American companies – the other members of the “Magnificent Seven” group including Apple, Amazon, Facebook parent Meta, Google parent Alphabet, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla – gained at least 0.7% apiece, led by Tesla’s 6% rise. 5.7%. That’s how much shares of Nvidia are down since Election Day, far underperforming the S&P 500 index’s 5% gain during the period. Notably, the six-week stretch has been a strong one for Nvidia’s big tech peers, as each of the other Magnificent Seven stocks advanced at least 9.9%. There has been no singular catalyst for the Nvidia selloff – its earnings report last month exceeded analyst estimates across the board – though the stock has previously slumped due to geopolitical fears from Nvidia’s reliance on Taiwanese manufacturers. The recent dip for Nvidia shares may be hard to digest for investors, especially in an otherwise rosy market, but the stock’s longer-term returns are still eye popping. Nvidia’s 170% year-to-date return is the best of any company valued at more than $200 billion, according to FactSet data, with shares up a whopping 700% over the last two years. Nvidia rose to prominence over the last two years as the unquestioned market leader in designing the semiconductor technology powering generative AI, causing its market capitalization to grow from below $300 billion in late 2022 to as high as $3.6 trillion last month. Nvidia, whose clientele includes Amazon and Microsoft, translated the surging interest in generative AI into a significant upswing in its financial performance, as sales grew by more than 600% during Nvidia’s most recent quarter compared to 2022’s comparable period. Nvidia is still the third-largest company in the world by market value, trailing only Apple and Microsoft. One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

The latest rally was spurred by Broadcom's better-than-expected earnings report late Thursday, and an uplifting outlook for the first quarter. Broadcom, which sells semiconductors and infrastructure software, is seeing soaring demand from the boom in generative artificial intelligence and reported a 220% jump in AI revenue for the year to $12.2 billion. Goldman Sachs analysts, who recommend buying Broadcom shares, lifted their 12-month target to $240 from $190, citing additional large customers for custom silicon. They also referenced management's execution following the $61 billion purchase of VMware, which closed last year. "We now have even higher conviction on the company's forward revenue and earnings growth outlook," the analysts wrote in a report dated Dec. 15. Barclays raised its priced target on the stock to $205 from $200, while Truist raised its call to $260 from $245. Broadcom shares are now up 126% for the year, closing at $250 on Monday. Nvidia, which has been the primary beneficiary of the AI craze due to the popularity of its graphics processing units, or GPUs, is up more than 165% this year, reaching a market cap of $3.2 trillion. The Nasdaq has gained 34%. Broadcom refers to its custom AI accelerators as XPUs, which are different than the GPUs Nvidia sells. Broadcom said it doubled shipments of XPUs in the quarter to "our three hyperscale customers." The company does not name the customers, but analysts say the three are Meta, Alphabet and TikTok parent ByteDance.

Title: 3 Enormous Supercomputers May Now Be In The Works

A smart phone is displaying the NVIDIA Corporation stock price on the NASDAQ market, with an NVIDIA ... [+] chip visible in the background, in this photo illustration taken in Brussels, Belgium, on December 30, 2023. (Photo by Jonathan Raa/NurPhoto via Getty Images) When I wrote about XAI’s Colossus project a few weeks ago, the scale of the initiative seemed, for lack of a better word, dizzying. You can look back at the video with Patrick from ServetheHome leading the audience through the halls of a supercomputing cluster ostensibly created to power XAI’s Grok chatbot: you can see row after row, rack after rack, of processors set in powerful motion, like a massive army, marching in lock-step and served with enormous amounts of electricity and water. According to recent news, a major vendor of AI hardware is now claiming that three of its major customers are planning projects on the colossal scale of Colossus. Broadcom reports that no fewer than three of its clients may develop data centers with 1,000,000 processors by 2027. This came from the company Q4 earnings call Dec 12, where leaders cited a 220% spike in revenue for the year. "As you know, we currently have three hyperscale customers who have developed their own multi-generational AI XPU roadmap to be deployed at varying rates over the next three years," President and CEO of Broadcom Hock Tan reportedly said on the call. "In 2027, we believe each of them plans to deploy 1,000,000 XPU clusters across a single fabric." For reference, Colossus started by reporting a need of 100,000 GPUs. After quickly doubling that order, Musk then came out with the frank update: that the center would require a cool million of the Nvidia GPUs that run there. Industry leaders like Jensen Huang marveled over the breakneck pace of the data center’s construction: so did notable journalists. It seemed like a unicorn. But is this kind of project, within the next few years, going to become de rigueur? The available reporting clarifies that there are no specific identifications of who is planning these enormous designs. Ask ChatGPT, and it will confirm this, although the model does give a list of top companies that it believes are more capable of scaling up these kinds of plans, including: · Nvidia · Microsoft · Amazon Web Services · Google · OpenAI · Meta · Tesla In addition, ChatGPT cites a collection of Chinese companies that have their own large data center capabilities, including Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu. When you dig a little deeper, it looks like most of these companies are pretty far from this metric. For instance, Mark Zuckerberg has publicly said that the company is aiming for about 350,000 data center GPUs by the end of this year. Google has estimated a total of 2 million GPUs in all of its global operations, not just one center. As for major clusters at AWS, where the hardware provides B2B services, one of the official numbers is that AWS has built a virtual supercomputer performing 9.95 petaflops, which looks like it would require a couple of hundred Nvidia H100s. So a million GPUs is still a really big deal. While the news is impressive, some are likely to be less than enthused about the idea of multiple data centers of this size. If we go back to Colossus, we have critics on the record talking about what they fear in terms of resource competition by this power-hungry behemoth. For one thing, Colossus is estimated to need up to 1,000,000 gallons of water per day - where you often see per capita municipal usage of around 100 gallons per day. There’s also the use of natural gas turbines to provide all of that energy… Experts have been suggesting for a while now that the U.S. is poised to expand nuclear power infrastructure, in order to power data centers, and specifically, to locate the power sources right next to the superclusters in order to make things more efficient. But even if they’re 100% efficient, it’s obvious that the power needs are going to be immense. As key journalists and others covering this issue have been pointing out, things are moving at an incredibly rapid pace. We’re going to have to figure out what impact these supercomputers are making on our society, because even though Colossus is the only one publicly identified as in the works, others are likely to be here soon.

December 16, 2024 06:30 ET | Source: Radisson Mining Resources Inc. Radisson Mining Resources Inc. ROUYN-NORANDA, Quebec, Dec. 16, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Radisson Mining Resources Inc. (TSX-V: RDS, OTCQB: RMRDF) (“Radisson” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce results from an important diamond drill hole at its 100%-owned O’Brien Gold Project (“O’Brien” or the “Project”) located in the Abitibi region of Québec. OB-24-337 is an exploratory hole drilled to a depth of 1,700 metres, the deepest hole ever drilled at the Project and the first hole drilled directly below the historic O’Brien Mine workings. At approximately 1,500 metres vertical depth it intersected sheared and mineralized rocks of the Piché Group, the dominant host rocks for O’Brien gold mineralization, and returned 242.0 g/t gold (“Au”) over 1.0 metre within a mineralized interval that averaged 31.24 g/t Au over 8.0 metres. Matt Manson, President and CEO, commented: “Following our “Jewellery Box” re-discovery news of December 9, 2024, we are taking the unusual step of releasing assays from another single drill hole today because of its particular significance to the future of the O’Brien Gold Project. Hole OB-24-337 was intended to be a pilot hole testing whether the Project’s host geology extended below the historic mine and to be a platform for future wedging and directional drilling. The fact that this hole intersected mineralization and visible gold at such a high grade greatly exceeded our expectations. Recall that approximately 75% of our existing Mineral Resource is defined at depths above 600 metres. On September 24th we announced that drill hole OB-24-324 had intersected 27.61 g/t Au over 6.0 metres at 1,100 metres vertical depth. Now, we have new gold mineralization in a classic O’Brien setting at 1,500 metres vertical depth, a full 500 metres below the deepest workings of the old mine. It is clear that O’Brien gold mineralization is extensive at depth, implying significant future upside potential for the Project.” Figure 1: Visible Gold in Drill Hole OB-24-337 Figure 2: Long Section in Oblique View of Gold Vein Mineralization and Mineral Resources at the O’Brien Gold Project, with Drill Hole OB-337 and Other Recent Deep Drill Holes Illustrated. Table 1: Detailed Assay Results from Drill Hole OB-24-337 Notes on Calculation of Drill Intercepts:The O’Brien Gold Project March 2023 Mineral Resource Estimate (“MRE”) utilizes a 4.50 g/t Au bottom cutoff, a US$1600 gold price, a minimum mining width of 1.2 metres, and a 40 g/t Au upper cap on composites. Intercepts from drill hole OB-24-337 presented in Table 1 are calculated with a 1.00 g/t bottom cut-off over a minimum 1.0 metre core length so as to illustrate the frequency and continuity of mineralized intervals within which high-grade gold veins at O’Brien are developed. Intercepts presented in the deep drill hole compilation in Table 2 are calculated with a 3.00 g/t Au bottom cut-off, representing the lower limit of cut-off sensitivity presented in the March 2023 Mineral Resource Estimate. Sample grades are uncapped. True widths, based on depth of intercept and drill hole inclination, are estimated to be 30-70% of core length.

Seven deep drill holes or drill hole wedges have been completed since this time. Six of the seven returned instances of visible gold and five of the seven returned drill intercepts well above the Project’s grade cutoff in the March 2023 MRE. The holes were drilled at northerly declinations with initial inclinations of between -65 and -85 degrees, followed by angling to provide a high angle of incidence with the southerly dip of the Piché Group rocks and vein mineralization. Estimated true widths of drill intercepts at the point of contact with mineralization is estimated to be 30-70% of core length. Deep drill results since September 2024, summarized in Table 2, have now included: and now: The frequency and grade of intercepts returned by these deep drill holes, as well as the observed host geology, its deformation, the style of alteration, and the mineralogical association of the gold mineralization, are all familiar from the historical O’Brien mine and consistent with the modern geological model developed at shallower depths. The implication is that characteristic O’Brien style gold mineralization is extensive at depth, well below the level of the historic mine workings and the current MRE. Gold Mineralization at O’Brien Gold mineralizing quartz-sulphide veins at O’Brien occur within a thin band of interlayered mafic volcanic rocks, conglomerates, and porphyric andesitic sills of the Piché Group occurring in contact with the east-west oriented Larder Lake-Cadillac Break (“LLCB”). Gold, along with pyrite and arsenopyrite, is typically associated with shearing and a pervasive biotite alteration, and developed within multiple Piché Group lithologies and, occasionally, the hanging-wall Pontiac and footwall Cadillac meta-sedimentary rocks. As mapped at the historic O’Brien mine, and now replicated in the modern drilling, individual veins are generally narrow, ranging from several centimetres up to several metres in thickness. Multiple veins occur sub-parallel to each other, as well as sub-parallel to the Piché lithologies and the LLCB. Individual veins have well-established lateral continuity, with near-vertical, high-grade shoots developed over significant lengths. The historic O’Brien mine produced over half a million ounces of gold from such veins and shoots at an average grade exceeding 15 g/t and over a vertical extent of at least 1,000 metres. Based on drilling complete to the end of 2022, the Project has estimated Indicated Mineral Resources of 0.50 million ounces (1.52 million tonnes at 10.26 g/t Au), with additional Inferred Mineral Resources of 0.45 million ounces (1.60 million tonnes at 8.66 g/t Au). Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. Current exploration is focussed on delineating well developed vein mineralization to the east of the historic mine, with additional high-grade shoots becoming evident in the exploration data over what has been described as a series of repeating trends (“Trend #s 0 to 5”). Table 3: Drill Hole Collar Information for Holes contained in this News Release QA/QC All drill cores in this campaign are NQ in size. Assays were completed on sawn half-cores, with the second half kept for future reference. The samples were analyzed using standard fire assay procedures with Atomic Absorption (AA) finish at ALS Laboratory Ltd, in Val-d’Or, Quebec. Samples yielding a grade higher than 10 g/t Au were analyzed a second time by fire assay with gravimetric finish at the same laboratory. Mineralized zones containing visible gold were analyzed with metallic sieve procedure. Standard reference materials, blank samples and duplicates were inserted prior to shipment for quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) program.

Title: New Investment Scam Leverages AI, Social Media Ads to Target Victims Worldwide

Cybersecurity researchers are calling attention to a new kind of investment scam that leverages a combination of social media malvertising, company-branded posts, and artificial intelligence (AI) powered video testimonials featuring famous personalities, ultimately leading to financial and data loss. "The main goal of the fraudsters is to lead victims to phishing websites and forms that harvest their personal information," ESET noted in its H2 2024 Threat Report shared with The Hacker News. The Slovak cybersecurity company is tracking the threat under the name Nomani, a play on the phrase "no money." It said the scam grew by over 335% between H1 and H2 2024, with more than 100 new URLs detected daily on average between May and November 2024. The attacks play out through fraudulent ads on social media platforms, in several cases targeting people who have previously been scammed by making use of Europol- and INTERPOL-related lures about contacting them for help or getting their stolen money refunded by clicking on a link. These ads are published from a mix of fake and stolen legitimate profiles associated with small businesses, governmental entities, and micro-influencers with tens of thousands of followers. Other distribution channels include sharing these posts on Messenger and Threads, as well as sharing deceptively positive reviews on Google. "Another large group of accounts frequently spreading Nomani ads are newly created profiles with easy-to-forget names, a handful of followers, and very few posts," ESET pointed out. The websites these links direct to have been found to request for their contact information and visually imitate local news media; abuse logos and branding of specific organizations; or claim to advertise cryptocurrency management solutions with ever-changing names such as Quantum Bumex, Immediate Mator, or Bitcoin Trader. In the next step, cybercriminals use the data gathered from the phishing domains to directly call the victims and manipulate them into investing their money into non-existent investment products that falsely show phenomenal gains. In some cases, victims are duped into taking out loans or installing remote access apps on their devices. "When these victim 'investors' request payout of the promised profits, the scammers force them to pay additional fees and to provide further personal information such as ID and credit card information," ESET said. "In the end, the fraudsters take both the money and data and disappear – following the typical pig butchering scam." There is evidence to suggest that Nomani is the work of Russian-speaking threat actors given the presence of source code comments in Cyrillic and the use of Yandex tools for visitor tracking. Similar to major scam operations like Telekopye, it's suspected that there are different groups who are in charge of managing each and every aspect of the attack chain: Theft, creation, and abuse of Meta accounts and ads, building the phishing infrastructure, and running the call centers. "By using social engineering techniques and building trust with the victims, scammers often outmaneuver even the authorization mechanisms and verification phone calls the banks use to prevent fraud," ESET said. The development comes as South Korean law enforcement authorities said they took down a large-scale fraud network that defrauded nearly $6.3 million from victims with fake online trading platforms as part of an operation called MIDAS. More than 20 servers utilized by the fraud ring have been seized and 32 people involved in the scheme have been arrested. Besides luring victims with SMS and phone calls, users of the illicit home trading system (HTS) programs were enticed into investing their funds by watching YouTube videos and joining KakaoTalk chat rooms. "The program communicates with the servers of real brokerage firms to get real-time stock price information, and uses publicly available chart libraries to create visual representations," the Financial Security Institute (K-FSI) said in a presentation given at the Black Hat Europe conference last week. "However, no actual stock trades are made. Rather, the program's core feature, a screen capture function, is used to spy on users' screens, collect unauthorized information, and refuse to return money."

Title: Webscale Network Operators Exhibit Robust Growth and Investment in Q3 2024
URL: https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/12/16/2997294/28124/en/Webscale-Network-Operators-Exhibit-Robust-Growth-and-Investment-in-Q3-2024.html

December 16, 2024 05:14 ET | Source: Research and Markets Research and Markets Dublin, Dec. 16, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The "Webscale Network Operators: 3Q24 Market Review" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. This report reviews the growth and development of the webscale network operator (WNO, or webscale) market since 2011. It covers 21 companies. In the most recent 12 months (4Q23-3Q24), webscalers represented $2.53 trillion (T) in revenues (+9.1% YoY), $307 billion (B) in R&D spending (+6.5% YoY), and $254B in capex (+32.5% YoY). They had $631B of cash and short-term investments (-11.3% YoY) on the books as of September 2024, and $538B in total debt (-4.1% YoY). The value of webscalers' net plant, property & equipment (net PP&E) on the books as of September 2024 was $854B, up 25.9% YoY. Webscalers employed approximately 4.226 million (M) people at the end of 3Q24, up 2.3% from the Sept. 2023 total of 4.130M. Key Report Highlights: Revenues: Single quarter revenues in 3Q24 were $638.6 billion (B), up 10.6% YoY. That pushed annualized revenues to $2.527 trillion. Topline growth has been driven by the big 4: Alphabet, Amazon, Meta (FB) and Microsoft. For five straight quarters, all of these companies have recorded double digit revenue growth, well above the rest of the pack. For the 3Q24 annualized period, the fastest growth came from Meta, up 23.1% versus 4Q22-3Q23, followed by Microsoft (+16.4%), Alphabet (14.4%), and Amazon (11.9%). The biggest dollar impact on growth in 3Q24 came from Amazon, as its single quarter revenues grew $15.8 billion from 3Q23 to end 3Q24 at $158.9B, up 11.0% YoY. The only curb on growth in 3Q24 was Japanese IT services & cloud vendor Fujitsu, which recorded 3Q24 revenues of $5.8B, down $492 million (M) YoY (-7.8%). Capex: After declining 5% in 2023, webscale capex has grown at incredibly fast, unsustainable rates in 2024: up by 25%, 51%, and 58% YoY in the first three quarters of the year. 3Q24 capex of $75.6B pushed the annualized total to $253.9B, up 32.5% YoY, and another all-time high. Investor interest in generative AI has spread rapidly, driving GPU spend in the data center. The current investment spike would seem to be inspired by a mix of hype and fear of missing out, as GenAI brings with it a plethora of legal & regulatory risks and relative lack of proven business models. Most recent webscale capex is focused on outfitting existing data centers: from 46% of annualized capex in 3Q22, Network/IT and software capex was 53% of total capex for the latest annualized period. The biggest capex outlays in 3Q24 came from Amazon ($22.6B), Microsoft ($14.9B), Alphabet ($13.1B), and Meta (FB) ($8.3B). These four account for about 80% of single quarter spending. They are the reason behind the unsustainable surge in the price of NVIDIA stock. Profitability: Webscale free cash flow margins averaged out to 17.6% for the 3Q24 annualized period, a bit lower than a year prior (17.9%) but higher than the 14.1% booked in 3Q22. Average net profit margin for 4Q23-3Q24 was 18.9%, a bit higher than 16.9% in 3Q23. Both profitability metrics are around the same level as in the year before COVID. Meta, Tencent and Microsoft are regularly near or at the top of the heap on both metrics, and this was again the case in 3Q24. The ecommerce specialists Amazon and Alibaba are the laggards, as usual. The biggest drops in free cash flow margins came at the companies with surging capex: Alphabet and Amazon. The biggest decline in net profitability was Apple, which was fined 13 billion Euros in September 2024 for taking illegal profits from a tax scheme in Ireland over two decades. This tax scheme has been widely known about and criticized for many years. While 13 billion sounds like a lot, it hardly impacted Apple's market trajectory at all. Apple's stock price is around 14% higher now than on 1 July 2024. Consumers and taxpayers are losing out, while big tech uses political friends to secure victories. This will get worse with new political leadership in the US. Employees: Headcount in the webscale market totaled to 4.23 million in September 2024, slightly up from 4.13 million in September 2023. This difference is negligible, considering the size of some of the webscalers and how quickly the ecommerce specialists in particular can change workforce levels. Amazon's workforce grew by 51,000 between September 2023 and 2024, for instance. Total webscale headcount has been approximately 4.1 to 4.2 million or so steadily since late 2021. Some of the biggest webscalers are investing heavily in AI and GenAI, with one clear goal being to improve their internal cost efficiencies. This inevitably will mean fewer employees. Even within the ecommerce space, there is a rising use of robots and autonomous vehicles in the logistics chain. Per our latest forecast, we expect webscale employment to rise slightly in 2025 but decline thereafter due to greater use of robotics, automation and AI. Regional trends: The Asia-Pacific region has been a drag on the market for several quarters, and that continued in 3Q24. Webscale revenues in the Americas, Europe, and MEA have been growing in the low double digit range for a few quarters, but AP has been weak: 3Q24 revenue growth was 5% YoY, in line with the last few quarters of low single digit percentage growth. Weak Asian currencies and a very competitive 'big tech' market in China account for the gap. Another factor is TikTok. This company, owned by ByteDance, has grown at explosive rates for the last few years, but remains private. We have no reasonable way to include TikTok figures in our database. The ByteDance surge also ate into the 2022-23 growth of some western webscalers, notably Meta (FB), but that effect has ebbed.

Title: The hefty bill for the banks, the MPs’ initiatives, and the whining about the Metro, the disgrace of the TV-lawyer, and the billionaire’s financial strains

Greetings, well, it’s well-known that when K.M. takes charge of something, he doesn’t make mistakes or do sloppy work. That’s what happened yesterday during the budget discussion, where the measures he announced for the banks outshone any proposals from the opposition. But he also gave a social touch by imposing a “mandatory donation” of 100 million euros from the banks to support school infrastructure. So, Kyriakos Mitsotakis took things a step further and caught the bankers off guard with yesterday’s announcements. On fees for basic transactions (bill payments, dealings with the public sector, etc.), we’re looking at a complete elimination—not mere reductions, as initially expected. This is estimated to cost banks about 120 million euros annually, alongside the ENFIA (property tax) adjustment, as the Prime Minister mentioned legislative provisions to make this permanent. Add 100 million euros for the body that will manage properties of vulnerable borrowers and another 100 million for funding the renovation and construction of new schools, and the ENFIA adjustment. Altogether, the bill handed to the banks yesterday amounts to approximately 320 million euros. K.M.’s announcements, such as covering pharmaceutical expenses for low-income pensioners and granting a hazard allowance for uniformed personnel, were initially proposals from New Democracy MPs. Back then, they were labeled as “rebellious” initiatives, but the Maximos Mansion didn’t “criminalize” the suggestions. Instead, it processed them and is now implementing them. This way, the government showcases tangible actions, and the MPs can boast to their constituents that they influenced governmental decisions. The other day, there was a technical failure on a Thessaloniki Metro train. Passengers were inconvenienced, having to walk along the tunnel’s emergency corridor, which is specifically designed for such situations. The whole power outage lasted about 90 minutes, but the actual inconvenience for passengers was much shorter. Nobody truly claimed there was any risk to people because the power cut affected a Metro train. Yet, in Parliament, PASOK, SYRIZA, and the New Left (especially Haritsis, who pretends to be “modern”) raised a huge fuss. Honestly, I don’t think there’s another country in Europe where the opposition collectively blows up over a power cut in a single train on a completely new Metro system (and therefore bound to have some technical glitches). We’re talking about sheer ridiculousness! Six months ago, on a Sunday afternoon in early summer, the public was bombarded with reports about the arrest of a well-known TV lawyer who had almost beaten his wife and mother of his children to death. Initially, there were absurd excuses he gave during the investigation—claims that she “fell down the stairs”—but soon, under pressure from the police and investigators, she revealed the horrific truth. There was explosive media coverage for a few days. The coroner’s report revealed brutal beatings (17 punches to a woman’s face!). There were also dubious claims of psychiatric issues, and eventually, the whole thing faded out of the spotlight. Fast forward six months—before the year even ends—and this monster of a lawyer is appearing on TV shows as an angel. Look, here’s his new home, his new partner, and praise for his severely beaten ex-wife as a good mother, and so on. And life goes on. Now, you tell me: with a government that boasts laws against domestic violence and a justice system like ours, can anyone believe that things are improving in this country? Rot and corruption, or just the overwhelming sense that, in the end, everything here gets swept under the rug and left “half-resolved”? We still don’t have any progress on the issue of abolishing the Public Sector’s special rights in its 8.4% stake in the National Bank of Greece. The delay didn’t come from the Finance Ministry or the HFSF (Hellenic Financial Stability Fund). From the Greek side, all procedures are complete, and the delay stems from discussions between the ESM and SSM. The SSM doesn’t oppose abolishing the special rights, but the ESM wants to handle the matter in a way that fully safeguards their interests. So, it’s just a matter of time. Financial constraints—let’s put it politely—are plaguing the billionaire (?) Beny Steinmetz, also known as the “diamond king.” Word in the market is that he sold one of his two mines in Guinea (the operational one), as well as the nickel plant he owned in Skopje. Regarding the refinery in Italy, which even got the attention of the Financial Times, it was eventually bought by shipping magnate G. Economou because Steinmetz couldn’t come up with 140 million euros at the time. I’m telling you this to keep you informed since Greece doesn’t have many billionaires, and Steinmetz is one of them. Aside from being the diamond king, he’s also the king of arrests at airports (Israel, Cyprus, etc.), thanks to warrants against him. So, he’s spending his time in our country—not that he’s suffering, as he splits his days between a residence in Vouliagmeni (owned by a well-known Greek businessman) and his yacht. The regional airports packaged together Ultimately, the 22 regional airports will be granted as a single “package” to one operator. These airports will be released from the Hellenic Corporation of Assets and Participations (HCAP) for concession via an international tender in the first half of 2025. Advisors for the tender have already conducted on-site inspections of the airport cluster (Karpathos, Chios, Alexandroupolis, Araxos, Limnos, Ioannina, Milos, Naxos, Paros, Ikaria, Kythira, Leros, Sitia, Nea Anchialos, Kalymnos, Skyros, Syros, Astypalaia, Kastellorizo, Kastoria, Kasos, and Kozani) to assess their current condition and identify needs to structure the tender framework. There is also consideration for some of these airports to be utilized for cargo transport or charter flights. Additionally, there is an intention for HCAP to retain a stake in the airports, similar to the Kalamata airport case. However, some issues remain unresolved, such as matters involving the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), though HCAP estimates that the concession process will be completed by the end of 2027. The €765 million PPP for the prisons In April, bids are expected to be invited from interested companies for the major €765 million Public-Private Partnership (PPP) project involving the relocation of Korydallos prison to Aspropyrgos. A prerequisite is the approval of the environmental terms. A positive development is the recent approval of a special urban planning framework. The project, managed by the Recovery Fund’s Maturity Unit on behalf of the Ministry of Citizen Protection, involves partnering with a private entity for the design, construction, and maintenance of the facility for up to 30 years. Interest has been expressed by companies such as GEK Terna, Mytilineos, Aktor Concessions, and Avax, with the competitive dialogue nearing completion. The prisons will be relocated to a 100-acre property at the site of the former “American Convenience” military base in Aspropyrgos. The new premises and infrastructure for the modern Judicial Correctional Institution of Athens (JCIA) and the Attica Court Transfer Directorate (ACTD) will be located on the site of the old NATO base. End of an era Last year, Allianz stated that Christos Georgakopoulos, the founder of European Reliance, would remain a member of the board and an administrative advisor. However, his departure from the board of European Reliance-Allianz has quietly marked the end of his tenure. Tensions had arisen anyway, stemming from cultural differences between the German insurance giant and the Greek company. ADMIE board’s term extended Before the stock market opens today, ADMIE (the Independent Power Transmission Operator) will close the cycle of announcements for its nine-month results. Although the third-quarter financials are being released in mid-December, significantly late, they maintain expectations for a distribution of the remaining €14.5 million in dividends in September, along with the pre-dividend of €13.5 million. However, the key highlight is that by this time next year, the electrical connection between Attica and Crete will have been completed, generating an additional €770 million in annual revenue for ADMIE. Following the publication of the nine-month financial statements, a letter will be sent to shareholders regarding the renewal of the current administration’s term, resolving the final pending matter of the year. ECB halts bond purchases starting today Starting today, the European Central Bank (ECB) will permanently cease repurchasing bonds issued under the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program (PEPP). This marks the ECB’s withdrawal from the European bond market as the largest buyer of eurozone countries’ debt. The ECB launched PEPP in March 2020 following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, reaching a peak portfolio of €1.72 trillion two years later. Bond reinvestments were scaled back in July and officially end today, as the ECB wraps up for the holiday season. From now on, each issuer of debt—i.e., each individual country—will have to manage market fears and expectations, which will dictate the pricing of their bonds. The biggest challenge will likely be faced by France, where 52% of its public debt is managed by foreign investors and funds. France’s public debt already stands at 118% of GDP, and Paris will be seeking more than €300 billion (!) in 2025. Greece, on the other hand, appears to have managed its situation, with the €8 billion it needs to borrow next year not expected to pose a problem. The Public Debt Management Agency (PDMA) has planned only two new short-term bond issues and 10 re-issues on agreed dates. Industrial parks The prepayment (40% of the subsidy) from the Recovery Fund has been disbursed to ETBA Industrial Parks S.A. for the business plan aimed at developing industrial parks. elvoX automotive | mobility | technology is a Greek startup that designs and develops electric commercial vehicles—vans. Based in Acharnes, the elvoX team is striving to bring electric innovation to the commercial vehicle market. Reports suggest that this Greek startup has already attracted the interest of angel investors, mainly from the Middle East, for the development of its pioneering electric vehicles designed to meet the needs of urban and suburban professional transport, with the potential for future autonomous operation. Foreign investors are using Greece as a pilot “entry point” for research and development, prototype completion, and—if all goes well—the initiation of electric van production in Greece for the European market. Last Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 86 points (-0.2%), marking its 7th consecutive session of losses. This is the longest losing streak for the blue-chip index in nearly five years. This is happening during a period of general stock market euphoria on the other side of the Atlantic, where 46% of investors predict further price increases. However, at the same time, there have been record stock sales by major shareholders of Wall Street’s “champions.” For example, Jeff Bezos of Amazon sold $1.25 billion worth of his company’s shares in November. In total, in 2024, Amazon’s founder and his close associates sold $12.5 billion worth of shares. Last week, Mark Zuckerberg liquidated another block of Meta shares worth $153 million. In 2024 alone, Zuckerberg sold shares of the company he founded worth approximately $2.4 billion. Meta is now valued at over $1.5 trillion for the first time in history, and the S&P 500 index appears poised to end the year with annual gains of around 24% or more. Meanwhile, top executives at NVIDIA have also announced stock sales worth $1.85 billion this year. A total of about 11 million NVIDIA shares have been sold since the start of the year, the most of any single company. Jensen Huang, NVIDIA’s CEO, revealed he sold 6 million shares. The question remains: who knows better? Those selling shares of the companies they lead, or those buying them? The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) of the FED will conclude its two-day meeting this coming Wednesday. Markets have already priced in a quarter-point reduction in the federal funds rate. Things will get more interesting next year, with less consensus on how the FED should address persistent inflation amidst concerns about economic growth. But that’s a problem for next year. For now, investors have the holiday season to look forward to. The Bank of England and the Bank of Japan will announce their monetary policy decisions on Thursday. However, Jerome Powell’s problem is much more complex. Currently, the average interest rate on U.S. government debt is 3.4%, the highest since 2008. The U.S. government is paying heavily for its borrowing. Over the last two years, U.S. debt interest rates have more than doubled. About $6.4 trillion of U.S. debt is in treasury bills with an average interest rate of 4.7%, while $14.4 trillion is in government bonds with an average interest rate of 2.8%. In reality, the total net interest cost reached an annualized record pace of $1.1 trillion in the third quarter of 2024. The U.S. government is spending $3 billion EVERY DAY just on interest payments. This may very well be the only reason Powell feels compelled to reduce dollar interest rates… Explore related questions

GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links. Batman: The Arkham Saga Omnibus released in September for $150, but you can get this massive hardcover collection for only $82 at Amazon right now. By Steven Petite and Darryn Bonthuys on December 15, 2024 at 10:53PM PST Batman: The Arkham Saga Omnibus (Hardcover) $82 (was $150) Fans of Rocksteady's Batman Arkham games will want to check out Amazon's deal on the omnibus edition of the Arkham comics before the price jumps back up. The massive 1,648-page Batman: The Arkham Saga Omnibus released in September with a list price of $150, but Amazon currently has the hardcover book marked down to only $82. The 45% discount ($68 off) is by far the best deal yet on the omnibus collecting a treasure trove of comic book tales set in the world of the Arkham video games. Amazon says orders placed now (December 16) will arrive before Christmas, but make sure to double-check the shipping estimate if you're buying the omnibus for a Batman fan. The Arkham Saga Omnibus is far from the only awesome Batman deal available this holiday season. We've rounded up deals on Batman Lego sets, Blu-ray box sets, and the Meta Quest 3S Batman: Arkham Shadow bundle below the omnibus. $82 ($150) After Batman: Arkham Asylum became a huge hit in 2009, DC Comics didn't waste any time creating extra content for fans to dig into. This omnibus collects all of the Arkham comic book backstories, from the Dark Knight's first years on the streets in Batman: Arkham Origins to the dark and deadly stories of Batman: Arkham Knight Genesis and everything in between. The full list for this collection includes: These are all great miniseries and one-shots featuring several of DC's best creators at the helm, and Batman: Arkham Unhinged is notable for being a digital-first series that has been added to this collection. While it was later reprinted in traditional comic book form, it is nice to have it included with the other series in this omnibus. Another cool thing about this hardcover is that the Arkham City series was illustrated by Carlos D'Anda, who worked with Rocksteady to create several unique redesigns for Batman and his rogues gallery in the Arkham games. Batman: Arkham Collection $7.49 (was $60) If you haven't played all three Arkham games by Rocksteady, you can get Batman: Arkham Collection for PC (Steam keys) for only $7.49 at GameSpot sister site Fanatical. The collection includes Arkham Asylum, Arkham City City, and Arkham Knight--sorry folks, no Arkham Origins--and an 86% discount is hard to beat. Not only do you get a selection of games that have aged well, you're also getting all of their DLC and expansion pass content as well. If you're up for a replay, you can unlock some superb concept art, character models, and more with these games. GameStop has Batman Arkham Trilogy for Nintendo Switch discounted to $20. Performance on Switch, especially Arkham Knight, is not great, but if the choice is play the series on Switch or don't play it at all, you should play it on Switch. Lego Technic: The Batman Batcycle (641 Pieces) $30 (was $50) Lego Batman Construction Figure & Bat-Pod Bike (713 Pieces) $52 (was $65) Lego Batman: The Animated Series Batmobile (435 Pieces) $48 (was $60) Lego Batman Mech Armor + Minifigure (140 Pieces) $10 (was $15) Batman fans can save big on the Lego Technic Batcycle based on Robert Pattinson's ride in The Batman. Walmart is the only retailer that even has this 641-piece Lego set in stock, and the retailer is selling it for only $30 (was $50). The Batcycle is the best Batman Lego deal available right now, but you can also save 20% on a couple of other cool Batman kits featuring iconic vehicles from the film franchise. The Lego Batman Construction Figure and Bat-Pod Bike is on sale for $52 (was $65) at Amazon, while the Batman Animated Series Batmobile is available for $48 (was $60). Based on his appearance in The Dark Knight, the Batman Construction Figure is a buildable action figure that can attach to the functional Bat-Pod Bike. Together., the two builds add up to 713 pieces. The purple Batmobile is based on its iconic look from Batman: The Animated Series. This 435-piece Lego set includes three minifigures: Batman, Harley Quinn, and Mr. Freeze. Both of those sets released in August alongside the Batman Mech Armor Lego Set, a small 140-piece build that's discounted to only $10 (was $15) at Amazon. Batman 85th Anniversary 10-Film Collection On 4K Blu-ray $85 (was $205) Batman 80th Anniversary 18-Film Collection on Blu-ray $43 (was $90) If you're a fan of animated Batman movies, Batman's 85th Anniversary 10-Film Collection is on sale for only $85 at Amazon, which is its lowest price yet. The collection released in September and features 10 DC Universe Batman movies on 4K Blu-ray. You can also get the Batman 80th Anniversary 18-Film Collection on 1080p Blu-ray for only $43. You lose out on 4K resolution but get a bunch more movies. There's some overlap with these two box sets, so if you're interested in both, check out our full breakdown of the anniversary collections for more details. Here's a list of the best Batman 4K Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD deals at Amazon. Some of these deals aren't quite as good as Amazon had during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, but a bunch of them are pretty close. And in the case of the 85th Anniversary Collection, Amazon's current deal is actually better. Also, always-popular The Dark Knight Trilogy on 4K Blu-ray is only a few bucks more than its $30 Black Friday deal. The Batman Arkham series returned in October with Batman: Arkham Shadow, a virtual reality action game that's exclusive to the Meta Quest 3 and Meta Quest 3S, which launched alongside the game. All new Meta Quest 3 and 3S headsets come bundled with Arkham Shadow for free for a limited time. Amazon is sweetening the deal by throwing in a $30 digital gift card to use on your next purchase at Amazon. This offer is only available with the Meta Quest 3S 256GB for $400. You'll need to click "Redeem" button below the price on the store page or enter promo code QUEST30 to get the gift card. The Meta Quest 3S also comes with three months of Quest+, Meta's subscription service with a rotating library of games for members to play. You also get two free games each month, and those will remain in your library even if you cancel your subscription. At the moment, you're essentially getting seven free. games with the Meta Quest 3 and 3S. The Meta Quest 3S 128GB model costs $300. It doesn't include the $30 gift card, but it is the cheapest way to play Arkham Shadow. More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals & Preorders Got a news tip or want to contact us directly?

U.S. stock indexes drifted through mixed trading ahead of a meeting by the Federal Reserve later this week that could set Wall Street’s direction into next year NEW YORK -- U.S. stock indexes drifted amid mixed trading Monday, ahead of this week’s upcoming meeting by the Federal Reserve that could set Wall Street’s direction into next year. The S&P 500 rose 0.4%, coming off its first losing week in the last four. The Nasdaq composite climbed 1.2% to a record, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was a laggard and fell 110 points, or 0.3%. Broadcom leaped 11.2% to help lead the S&P 500 for a second straight day after delivering a profit report last week that beat analysts’ expectations. The technology company is riding a wave of enthusiasm about its artificial-intelligence offerings in particular. The market’s main event, though, will arrive on Wednesday when the Federal Reserve will announce its last move on interest rates for the year. The widespread expectation is that it will cut its main rate for a third straight time, as it tries to boost the slowing job market after getting inflation nearly all the way down to its target of 2%. The question is how much more it will cut rates next year, and Fed officials will release projections for where they see the federal funds rate ending 2025, along with other economic indicators, once their meeting concludes. Fed Chair Jerome Powell will also answer questions in a press conference following the meeting. For now, the general expectation among traders is that the Fed may cut a couple more times in 2025, according to data from CME Group. But such expectations have been shrinking following reports suggesting inflation may be tougher to get all the way down to 2% from here. Besides last month’s slight acceleration in inflation, another worry is that President-elect Donald Trump’s preferences for tariffs and other policies could lead to higher inflation down the line. Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle has dropped his earlier forecast of a cut by the Fed in January, for example. Beyond the possibility of tariffs, he said Fed officials may also want to slow their cuts because of uncertainty about exactly how low rates need to go so that they no longer press the brakes on the economy. Expectations for a series of cuts to rates by the Fed have been one of the main reasons the S&P 500 has set an all-time high 57 times so far this year and is heading for one of its best years of the millennium. The economy has held up better than many feared, continuing to grow even after the Fed hiked the federal funds rate to a two-decade high in hopes of grinding down on inflation, which topped 9% two summers ago. On Wall Street, MicroStrategy jumped as much as 7% during the day as it continues to benefit from the surging price for bitcoin, which set another all-time high. But its stock ended the day down by les than 0.1% after bitcoin’s price pulled back below $106,000 after setting a record above $107,700, according to CoinDesk. The software company has been building its hoard of the cryptocurrency, and its stock price has more than sextupled this year. It will also soon join the Nasdaq 100 index. Bitcoin’s price has catapulted from roughly $44,000 at the start of the year, riding a recent wave of enthusiasm that Trump will create a system that’s more favorable to digital currencies. Honeywell rose 3.7% after saying it’s still considering a spin-off or sale of its aerospace business, as part of a review of its overall business. It said it plans to give an update with the release of its fourth-quarter results. They helped offset a drop for Nvidia, whose chips are powering much of the world’s move into AI. Its stock fell 1.7%. Because it’s grown so massive, with a total value topping $3 trillion, it was the single heaviest weight on the S&P 500. All told, the S&P 500 rose 22.99 points to 6,074.08. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 110.58 to 43,717.48, and the Nasdaq composite rose 247.17 to 20,173.89. In the bond market, Treasury yields held relatively steady. The yield on the 10-year Treasury edged down to 4.39% from 4.40% late Friday. The two-year yield, which more closely tracks expectations for the Fed, eased to 4.24% from 4.25%. In stock markets abroad, indexes fell modestly across much of Europe and Asia. They sank 0.9% in Hong Kong and 0.2% in Shanghai after China reported lackluster economic indicators for November despite attempts to strengthen the world’s second-largest economy. South Korea’s Kospi fell 0.2% as law enforcement authorities pushed to summon impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol for questioning over his short-lived martial law decree, and the Constitutional Court met to discuss whether to remove him from office or reinstate him. ___ AP Business Writer Elaine Kurtenbach contributed. 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events

The Nasdaq outperformsU.S. stocks ended Friday mixed. The S&P 500 was flat, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 0.2% for its seventh straight day of losses and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.12%. Shares of Broadcom jumped 24%, launching it into the trillion-dollar market capitalization club. Europe's regional Stoxx 600 fell 0.53% to end the week in the red, snapping a three-week winning streak. OpenAI opens up about MuskOpenAI co-founder Elon Musk pushed to create a new for-profit structure for the company in 2017, OpenAI alleged in a blog post. However, "when he didn't get majority equity and full control, he walked away," wrote OpenAI alongside screenshots of Musk's email. In November, Musk asked a federal court to block OpenAI from converting to a for-profit entity. Tech companies donate to TrumpTechnology companies that have a history of clashes with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump are donating to his inauguration. Meta donated $1 million, the company confirmed to CNBC, Amazon is planning to donate the same amount, according to The Wall Street Journal and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is making a personal donation also of the same amount, according to the company. South Korea president impeachedSouth Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol was impeached on Saturday after 204 lawmakers in the National Assembly voted in favor of the motion. Prime Minister Han Duck-soo will serve as acting president. On Sunday, Han spoke with U.S. President Joe Biden, and the country's finance ministry said it would continue monitoring markets. [PRO] Eyes on rates and pricesInterest rates and inflation are in focus this week. The U.S. Federal Reserve's rate-setting meeting ends Wednesday, while the personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation because it reflects how consumers actually spend money, comes out on Friday. A near-surefire of figuring out where markets are heading is to make a prediction — and disregard it. The S&P 500 may have slipped 0.6% last week, snapping its three-week winning streak. But it's still up almost 27% this year, shattering the 6,000 level for the first time on its journey upward. That's way ahead of forecasts made by top financial strategists at the end of 2023, notes CNBC's Pia Singh. JPMorgan's chief U.S. equity strategist, Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, for instance, expected the broad-based index to close the year at just 4,200. Even the most optimistic prediction — a 5,200 target from John Stoltzfus, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer — didn't capture the exuberant stock rally this year. And that's why even though market strategists anticipate the S&P to finish 2025 at 6,630, according to the average forecast from the CNBC Market Strategist Survey, investors should take it with a pinch of salt. Granted, there's positive sentiment bubbling among investors, thanks to Trump's high regard for the stock market as a barometer for his presidential tenure, steadily loosening monetary policy, the prospect of lower corporate taxes, among other factors. But, in markets — as in life — the best laid plans of mice and men often go awry. Inflation might make an unwelcome return — like measles and possibly polio in the U.S. — because of Trump's promised tariffs and the tit-for-tat trade wars that could ensue. Indeed, inflation already "looks a little stuck," said Goldman Sachs' vice chairman Robert Kaplan, previously president of the Dallas Fed. Still, despite my skepticism of predictions, I'd love it if Bank of America's Savita Subramanian proves to be a prescient market forecaster. Imagine ending 2025 with the S&P at Subramanian's target of 6,666. — CNBC's Sarah Min, Pia Singh, Sean Conlon and Samantha Subin contributed to this report. Got a confidential news tip?
