ByMark Minevich, Contributor. In recent weeks, AI investors and enterprise leaders have felt the yo-yo effect of the AI market. Starting August 18, a four-day slide erased almost $1 trillion from the market caps of tech’s megacap companies. Nvidia, Palantir, and other so-called AI companies shed billions in value in a matter of days. Meta has announced a hiring freeze in its AI division. Even the CEO of OpenAI, Sam Altman, casually remarked that “AI is a bubble.” The irony? Engineers in the sector continue to command $100 million pay packages. AI startups continue to raise funding at valuations that defy gravity. Additionally, companies from Microsoft to Google are integrating AI features across their products at a record speed. The real question isn’t whether AI is a bubble. The better question is: what kind of bubble—if any—are we in, and what comes after? For much of the past 18 months, AI stocks soared based on projections and expectations. Nvidia tripled in value. Palantir’s valuations are reminiscent of the dot-com era. In August, the S&P’s price-to-book ratio reached 5.3, which is higher than the 2000 bubble peak. When valuations stretch that far, even small doubts can trigger outsized sell-offs. The rotation out of AI has been partly seasonal. August is historically weak for equities, and funds have been taking profits in overcrowded trades. However, the speed and depth of AI’s decline reveal something deeper: investors are finally asking tough questions about the business impact. New data fueled that scrutiny. A report from MIT showed that 95% of generative AI pilots fail to deliver any measurable return on investment. McKinsey research similarly found that while 8 in 10 companies deploy generative AI tools, most see no bottom-line gains. AI may be everywhere in boardrooms and demos, but it remains conspicuously absent from earnings statements. This fact is what caused markets to dip. The MIT statistic shouldn’t surprise seasoned executives. Many companies are treating AI as a marketing checkbox rather than a strategic capability. Money is being funneled into headline-grabbing initiatives, such as customer-facing chatbots and generative content tools. At the same time, the real ROI lies hidden in back-office automation, supply chain optimization, and finance functions. The most significant determinant of success isn’t the model itself, but how it’s adopted and integrated. Companies that prioritize impressive demos without redesigning workflows inevitably fail. By contrast, enterprises that embed AI into core processes (expense reporting, claims processing, compliance checks) consistently see measurable productivity gains. Another issue is the obsession with building in-house. For many organizations, partnering with trusted vendors provides faster time-to-value and avoids the talent bottleneck. Trying to replicate what OpenAI, Microsoft, or Google has already done internally often results in wasted human hours and failed pilots. Then there’s the problem of “agent sprawl.” As different departments spin up their own AI pilots, enterprises risk a patchwork of ungoverned tools, inconsistent security, and rising costs. Without a governance model that scales, these initiatives collapse under their own weight. The reality is that adoption strategy, not AI hype, determines ROI. The mixed signals coming from industry leaders further complicate the picture. Sam Altman’s “AI is a bubble” remark spooked investors, although insiders suggest his comments were directed at the valuations of huge startups, not giants like OpenAI or Nvidia. Some even speculate it was a tactical move, cooling off competitors such as Meta, which had been luring OpenAI engineers with $100 million signing packages. Meta’s AI hiring freeze may appear ominous on the surface, but the company is actually spending more than ever on AI infrastructure. The shift isn’t about retreat, but about moving from a talent land-grab to execution. In fact, Microsoft, Google, and Meta are quietly doubling down on AI integration across products that generate real revenue. Plus, Nvidia, despite stock swings, reported data center revenue up nearly 70% year-over-year. This further drives home the point that the infrastructure layer of AI is delivering tangible profits. The signs of a bubble are undeniable with valuations stretched to dot-com levels, engineers signing contracts worth nine figures and a 95% project failure rate in enterprise pilots. But there are equally strong signs that this is merely a correction. Unlike the dot-com era, today’s AI leaders are not speculative bets; they’re profitable, cash-rich companies building foundational technologies. Nvidia, Microsoft, and Google are not Pets.com. A more useful analogy may be the early internet. In 1995, valuations were huge, startups were burning cash, and most experiments failed. But beneath the noise, the infrastructure for a digital economy was being laid. The productivity payoff lagged the hype, but when it arrived, it reshaped the global economy. AI is following a similar trajectory. In the near term, volatility is unavoidable. Valuations will continue to be tested. Venture funding will tighten, forcing weak AI startups into consolidation or collapse. Public companies that heavily rely on AI marketing without demonstrating effective adoption will remain under pressure. The headlines and hype around $100 million salaries and “AI everywhere” marketing will cool. Many projects will be quietly wound down as the easy money phase of AI comes to an end. AI is not a feature, it is a general-purpose technology on par with electricity and the internet. It is already transforming healthcare, energy, finance, defense, logistics, and education. The productivity paradox is fundamental, as significant investments must come first and measurable gains follow later. Just as the internet required massive infrastructure before creating trillions in value, AI requires time to mature and integrate. By 2030, analysts project AI will add trillions of dollars to the global economy. Most startups will vanish, but the survivors (likely fewer than 5%) will dominate entire industries. The next decade will see the rise of new global giants, and the reshaping of competition across every sector. We’re not witnessing the end of AI, we’re witnessing the end of its hype cycle. The startup bubble is deflating. The talent war is cooling. But the underlying trend of AI as a driver of productivity, transformation, and new business models is only beginning. This is not a dot-com bus, but a recalibration of expectations. Execution will matter more than narrative. The adoption strategy will matter more than the experiments. Enterprises that focus on back-office productivity, integration, and governance will capture real ROI. In the short term, expect volatility, pain, and consolidation. In the long term, expect AI to weave into every industry and redefine productivity, creativity, and competition. Yes, some air is coming out, but AI itself is no bubble. The future belongs to AI. The only question is which enterprises will survive the shakeout and lead the next industrial revolution.

Title: S&P 500's Weight In Mag 7 Stocks Passes 30%. Is This A Diversification Risk?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/sp-500-weight-mag-7-stocks-diversification-risk/
Time Published: 2025-08-26T16:57:44Z

ByCatherine Brock, Contributor. There are 500 companies in the S&P 500, but only a small percentage have the power to move the index on their own. Among those elite companies are the Magnificent 7—seven stocks that helped drive the S&P 500 to 20%-plus gains in 2023 and 2024. Thanks to their collective success, the Magnificent 7 stocks comprise over one-third of the S&P 500—prompting many investors to wonder if it’s time to worry about concentration risk. Let’s answer that question by reviewing the key factors, potential diversification strategies and expert commentary about the historically high Mag 7 concentration. The Magnificent 7 Stocks are: These seven stocks comprised about 36% of the S&P 500 large-cap index. The remaining 64% of the index was spread across 493 other companies. The Mag 7 concentration first stretched above 30% in 2023. Only eight years prior, these stocks accounted for 12.4% of the S&P 500. By 2022, the concentration had risen to 21.6%. In those years, the collective market capitalization of the Mag 7 companies rose from $2.2 trillion to $6.9 trillion. Today, their total market cap exceeds $19 trillion. The growth has been driven by technology innovation and leadership. Nvidia's success in AI has been particularly influential. It encouraged other tech leaders to sharpen their AI focus and positioned AI as a major wealth opportunity for investors. The S&P 500 weights its constituents using a free-float market capitalization method, which assigns higher weights to larger companies. As a result, larger companies have greater influence over the index than smaller companies. Free-float market cap is the market value of a public company, calculated as the share price times the number of available shares. A stock’s free-float market capitalization relative to the aggregate market cap of the index determines its weight. The total market cap of the S&P 500 is about $54.3 trillion. The largest index member is Nvidia, which has a market cap of $4.4 trillion. To calculate Nvidia's weight in the index, divide $4.4 trillion by $54.3 trillion—which equates to about 8%. Stock price changes affect a company's market capitalization, which in turn influences the index. A company’s weighting in an index can increase when its stock performs better than others, assuming there's no corresponding change in share count. A change to one company's weighting changes all the weightings, since the weighting total is always 100%. Equal-weighted indexes give each constituent the same influence over the group. For example, an equal-weighted S&P 500 fund weights each company at 0.2%. In practice, this means a price increase from Nvidia is as influential as a price increase from Enphase Energy (ENPH), the smallest company in the S&P 500. Note that the S&P 500 contains 503 stocks representing 500 companies. The three additional stocks relate to companies with multiple share classes, such as Alphabet's (GOOG) and (GOOGL). Invesco's S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP) splits Alphabet's total weighting across its two share classes. Since 2023, Mag 7 concentration has contributed to a cumulative S&P 500 gain of 68.4%. In the same timeframe, Invesco’s RSP ETF gained 34.2%. That means market-cap weighting of the Mag 7 concentration has roughly doubled the gains for S&P 500 investors over the last two years. Some of the Mag 7 have continued to be among the best stocks of 2025. As long as the group outperforms, the high concentration enhances S&P 500 returns. Securities that can rise quickly can also fall quickly. There is a chance investors will become disillusioned with AI and technology stocks. Some analysts suggest this is already happening. Last week, Nvidia, Microsoft and other tech stocks dipped after an MIT report suggested that AI investments are not producing measurable returns. These quick pullbacks happen because investors have high growth expectations for these tech leaders. Any sign of a more modest growth trajectory can prompt investors to sell. So, just as Mag 7 outperformance can lift the S&P 500, underperformance of this group can drag the entire S&P 500 down. You can reduce your Mag 7 concentration risk by eliminating redundant funds, reallocating capital to an equal-weight fund or adding exposures to asset types that don't overlap with the S&P 500. The first step to managing Mag 7 concentration risk is understanding how much exposure you have. Review your holdings and note any funds with overlapping portfolios. If you have an S&P 500 fund, market-cap weighted funds targeting any of the following groups will have overlapping Mag 7 exposure: More specifically, if you're worried about Mag 7 concentration risk, you shouldn’t have your entire net worth split between, say, SPY and QQQ. Pick one or reduce your exposure to both. You can also shift some of your existing S&P 500 exposure to an equal-weighted fund. The amount you move depends on your outlook for the Mag 7. If you believe the technology run is largely played out, you could drop the market-cap-weighted exposure entirely. Or, you could take a more modest approach and move 25% of your market-cap-weighted S&P 500 funds into an equal-weighted fund. This would dilute your concentration slightly but still provide upside if Nvidia and friends continue creating value. The S&P 500 is a large-cap index. It has no exposure to small caps, mid caps or international stocks. You could therefore dilute your Mag 7 exposure by investing in these categories via individual stocks or funds. If you are investing in a taxable account with unrealized gains, this reallocation will have tax consequences. You could delay the tax liability by changing the composition of your future trades instead of selling to rebalance. This would shift your exposure gradually. Or, if you're worried about an imminent dip in Mag 7 stocks, sell off a chunk of your S&P 500 exposure and use the proceeds to pay taxes and add the new holdings. In interviews, two experts characterized the Mag 7 concentration risk as worthy of caution, but not panic. Ayako Yoshioka, portfolio consulting director at Wealth Enhancement, notes that most of the Mag 7 companies have strong business models and healthy balance sheets. And while their valuations are high, they are “not overly outlandish,” in Yoshioka’s view. She says concentration risk is a concern, “but timing when it will become a material consequence to overall index returns is difficult to predict.” Dion Hinchcliffe, vice president and CIO practice lead at Futurum Group, believes Mag 7 dominance will continue to enhance returns in the short term. But longer term, the dynamic will change. Signs to watch for include slowing AI monetization and rising investor interest in lagging sectors. Hinchcliffe says, “The danger isn’t just the Mag 7 falling, it’s that the rest of the index is simply too weak to pick up the slack when they do.” Bottom Line The high concentration of the Mag 7 in the S&P 500 increases the index’s potential volatility, but also enhances returns. While there aren’t definitive signs the Mag 7 stocks are losing momentum, they won’t remain dominant forever. Diversification into other asset types can prep your portfolio for that shift. Who Are the Mag 7 Stocks in the S&P 500? The Mag 7 stocks in the S&P 500 are Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), Meta Platforms (META) and Tesla (TSLA). Is It A Concern If 30% Of The Index Is In 7 Stocks? A 30% concentration of seven stocks in one index is a concern if all seven stocks share similar behaviors. The Mag 7 stocks are technology-focused growth companies that have, at times, risen and fallen together. That behavior can encourage excess volatility in the S&P 500. How Can I Diversify Away from Mag 7 Risk? You can diversify away from Mag 7 risk by adding small-cap, mid-cap and international stock exposure to your portfolio. You could also opt for an equal-weight S&P 500 fund instead of a traditional market-cap-weighted S&P 500 fund. Has This Level of Concentration Happened Before? The concentration of the top 10 stocks in the S&P 500 has historically remained below 30%, averaging 24% according to Visual Capitalist. Before 2023, the last high point in the concentration of the top 10 S&P 500 stocks was 28% in 1970.

Title: $25 for that? Consumers are going elsewhere for lunch.

Good morning. Last night, US President Donald Trump said he was firing Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook "effective immediately." In a letter shared on Truth Social, Trump said there was "sufficient reason" to believe Cook had made false statements on mortgage agreements. In response, Cook said Trump has no authority to fire her and she will not resign. Meanwhile, in today's newsletter, fast casual chains like Chipotle and Cava are losing their freshness. What's on deck: Markets: Why Sydney Sweeney's jeans ad won't save American Eagle's stock. Tech: A mix of AI FOMO and fear is sweeping Hollywood. Business: Why Labubus are a billion-dollar bubble ready to burst. But first, the rise and fall of the fast-casual slop bowl. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Let's grab lunch — my treat. Anywhere you want, as long as it's not Chipotle, Cava, or Sweetgreen. You expect me to pay $25 for … that? They've been dubbed "slop bowls," those mounds of vegetables, grains, and a protein or two. They were all the rage in the 2010s. Now, they could be why some fast casual chains are losing out, BI's Emily Stewart writes. The complaints are piling up: warm, weird salads; ingredients combined in the wrong way; portions so small, customers are filming employees just to try and get more food. And for the privilege? A price tag that makes you want to hurl. "Value is front of mind for nearly every consumer right now, and I think these restaurants just don't have a sharp enough value proposition," says Zak Stambor, a senior retail and e-commerce analyst at EMARKETER. So consumers appear to be going elsewhere, to places where, if they're spending that kind of money, they can sit down and get a better experience. Places that feel more affordable, more satisfying. Places like Chili's. Chili's has been on a hot streak. In its most recent earnings report, the CEO of Chili's parent company, Brinker, took a victory lap, declaring: "Chili's is officially back, baby back." The chain posted impressive sales growth, pushing Brinker's revenue past Wall Street's expectations to $1.46 billion. Alex Fasciano, a senior equity research analyst at CFRA Research, noted that Darden Restaurants (which owns Olive Garden) and The Cheesecake Factory have also had a strong year. Part of that growth may come from value-conscious diners tired of paying more for less. "Why am I paying $25 for a burrito and chips and guac when I could pay maybe a little bit more and have full service?" Fasciano says. With more of us heading back into the office, many are only just realising how expensive these slop bowls have gotten. What started as a slightly more expensive, healthier alternative to fast food now feels overpriced and underwhelming. As America's slop bowl moment fades, the next big thing might just be a full plate and a fair price. 1. Trump has bought $100 million in bonds since starting his second term. That's according to a new filing from the Office of Government Ethics. The president's bond purchases could stand to benefit if the Federal Reserve cuts rates, which Trump has been pressuring the central bank to do for months. 2. Behind Palantir's bad month. The tech titan's stock was flying high in 2025, reaching a record high in mid-August before shares fell 17%. Investors are feeling hesitant about Palantir's stock for three reasons, but optimism remains strong around its long-term trajectory. 3. Sydney Sweeney can't keep American Eagle's stock afloat. Bank of America analysts cut their rating on the stock to "underperform," citing the negative impact of tariffs. Any positive impact from Sweeney's jeans ad, including its rise to meme stock fame last month, will get canceled out, the firm said. 1. How Hollywood is using AI on the hush. Entertainment giants like Netflix and Lionsgate have recently touted their embrace of AI, but the tech still has a stigma among the creative community. Five Hollywood insiders told BI they dread being associated with AI, and those who are using it are doing so in secret. 2. Meta continues to poach AI talent for its superintelligence team. Meta has recruited at least 10 previously unreported researchers from Google's DeepMind since July, according to LinkedIn data reviewed by BI. The tech giant has also targeted Scale AI, with six of its AI researchers announcing their departures to join Meta in recent weeks. 3. OpenAI ramps up its healthcare push with a new hire. The company has tapped Doximity cofounder Nate Gross to lead its growing healthcare business. OpenAI aims to sell directly to healthcare customers rather than power other companies' products, reflecting a larger pivot: it wants to own not just foundation models, but AI infrastructure and applications, too. 1. Why Labubus are a billion-dollar bubble ready to burst. The popular dolls are on track to do $1 billion in sales this year, according to EMARKETER. And although they are no Beanie Babies, it's hard to imagine that Labubus will still be popular years from now, writes BI's Katie Notopoulos. 2. Burning Man kicks up business deals, too. Tech moguls, celebrities, and models flock to the Black Rock Desert every year for the Burning Man festival. But they do more than just party: Google cofounders Sergey Brin and Larry Page, and DreamWorks cofounder Jeffrey Katzenberg, are among the leaders who have made key business decisions amid the dusty festivities. 3. Why this app's CEO will cancel a user's $25K subscription. Dorsia lets its users snag reservations at top restaurants for either $175, $5,175, or $25,175 a year. CEO Marc Lotenberg says he's kicked several users off the platform since its launch in 2022, and told BI "being rude to servers" is a bannable offense. Hallam Bullock, senior editor, in London.

Title: 'AI-driven demand will remain robust': Wall Street is bullish on chip spending ahead of Nvidia earnings

Nvidia's earnings report is here — but clarity on its future chip sales in China isn't. Nvidia reported fiscal second-quarter earnings on Wednesday after the closing bell, revealing it beat revenue and earnings forecasts for the period, with sales of $46.74 billion and EPS of $1.05. Its third-quarter forecast was less rosy, as it didn't factor in any H20 chip sales in China, an important market for the company. Nvidia's chief financial officer, Colette Kress, said that the company is awaiting a formal regulation on the 15% remittance that the White House wants Nvidia and AMD to pay from chips sold to China as a condition to allow it to continue sales in the region. Nvidia is ready to ship between $2 to $5 billion in H20 chips, the CFO added. "We're still waiting on several of the geopolitical issues going back and forth between the governments and the companies trying to determine their purchases and what they want to do," she said. Nvidia provided a revenue range for the current quarter of $52.9 billion to $55.1 billion, compared to expectations of $53.46 billion. While the revenue forecast may seem in line, some analysts had put the figure closer to $60 billion. Nvidia said it didn't sell any H20 chips to China during the second quarter, although some inventory was sold to a customer outside of the country. "We just have to keep advocating," Huang says of the company's efforts to convince the Trump administration to let it do business in China. "It is the second-largest computing market in the world, and it is also the home of AI researchers. About 50% of the world's AI researchers are in China," he said. "So it's fairly important, I think, for the American technology companies to be able to address that market." Huang said demand for Nvidia's AI chips continues to be strong. "Everything's sold out," he said. Nvidia's stock slid 3% in volatile after-hours trading shortly after the results. The stock's year-to-date gain was 35% at market close. Huang and Kress answered analysts' questions during a follow-up earnings call — scroll on for the play-by-play. In a post-earnings note, analysts at Jefferies wrote that demand signals for Nvidia products remain rock solid. "Everything remains sold-out across both Hopper and Blackwell, with one non-restricted customer even buying H20s," analysts led by Blayne Curtis wrote. "Plenty of runway for continued growth in both Compute and Networking as situation in China continues to work itself out." Dan Ives, a perenially bullish analyst at Wedbush, did not hold back on his praise for the chip giant in a post-earnings note. "The Godfather of AI Jensen and Nvidia delivered another robust quarter after the bell beating the Street estimates on the top and bottom-lines again while providing stronger guidance than Street expectations," he wrote. On China, Ives wrote that Nvidia beat revenue expectations despite a $4 billion decline in China H20 sales. The company also has supplies ready to be shipped when the geopolitical situation clears up. "This is a very important print and guide for the broader tech world and it shows the AI Revolution is heading into its next gear of growth despite the current headwinds with China," Ives wrote. David Wagner, the head of equity at Aptus Capital Advisors, wrote in a note to Business Insider that the negative stock reaction feels like an "incorrect knee-jerk reaction," and that the company's current growth rate is still "remarkable." "I actually thought the best part of the report was the gross margin guidance of 73.5% showing resilience in profitability, even without any China H20 revenue," Wagner said. In his closing remarks, Huang shouts out Blackwell's platform and says it's the "AI platform the world's been waiting for." He also mentions Rubin and says Blackwell Ultra is "ramping at full speed." Eventually, he said Nvidia will need to build two factories, one for the machines and another for robotic AI. Nvidia's stock is down 2.7% in after-hours trading as Huang ends the call. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says AI-native startups' revenues could surge 10 times, from about $20 billion in total this year to as much as $200 billion next year, noting that they already grew 10x compared to 2024. Huang adds that funding for AI startups has already hit $180 billion in 2025, with open-source models helping drive adoption across industries from large enterprises to robotics. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says demand for AI chips remains so intense that the latest buzz is that "everything's sold out," including Nvidia's H100s and H200 chips. He adds that AI startups are scrambling for GPUs to train their models, while major cloud providers are even renting capacity from rivals. Huang says revenue generation, AI capability, and customer margins can be improved through releasing new architectures. He says customers should build data centers on "annual rhythm," but he didn't give too many details about Nvidia's next generation of chip architecture, Rubin, which is expected in 2026. "Rubin has a lot of great ideas, I'm anxious to tell you, but I can't right now," Huang says, teasing that he'll share more at Nvidia's next GTC conference. "We just have to keep advocating," Huang says of the company's efforts to convince the Trump administration to let it do business in China. He says the chipmaker is talking to the administration about "the importance of American companies" getting access to China's market. Earlier in the call, Kress said that the company is awaiting a formal regulation on the 15% remittance that the White House wants Nvidia and AMD to pay from chip sales to China. Huang says he sees massive market potential in China that US technology companies need to be able to take advantage of. "It is the second-largest computing market in the world, and it is also the home of AI researchers. About 50% of the world's AI researchers are in China," he says. "So it's fairly important, I think, for the American technology companies to be able to address that market." CEO Jensen Huang says that Nvidia's Blackwell is well-positioned for what he sees as the revolutionary changes brought about by agentic AI. "Where chatbots used to be one-shot, you give it a prompt, and it would generate the answer," Huang says. "Now, the AI does research, it thinks, it does a plan, and it might use tools." Huang says the amount of computation necessary for agentic AI models could be "a 100 times, a thousand times, and you potentially even more." As a result, he says that agentic AI has grown rapidly over the last year. "And, of course, the effectiveness has also grown tremendously," he says. "The amount of hallucination has dropped significantly." Kress says that Nvidia is ready to ship anywhere between $2 to $5 billion in H20 chips, but the shipments hinge on ongoing geopolitical tensions resolving. "We're still waiting on several of the geopolitical issues going back and forth between the governments and the companies trying to determine their purchases and what they want to do," she says. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang speaks for the first time on the call. (No prepared remarks for the Nvidia CEO this time around.) Nvidia's gaming revenue reached a record $4.3 billion, a 49% year-over-year increase, Kress says. While Nvidia's AI chips are all the rage among Big Tech, the company used to be better known for its gaming chips for PCs, which it continues to sell. Revenue for this segment in the previous quarter was $3.8 billion. CFO Kress says the company hasn't shipped any H20 chips to China this quarter, despite some customers receiving licenses in recent weeks. She says US officials have floated taking a 15% cut of licensed H20 sales to China, but no regulation enforcing this has been published yet. Nvidia is excluding China's H20 revenue from its Q3 outlook while Nvidia continues to work through geopolitical issues. A key update: If restrictions ease, the CFO estimates $2 to $5 billion in H20 sales could flow in the third quarter. Nvidia's stock ticked slightly higher after hours following the remarks. Nvidia CFO Colette Kress says the company expects $3 to $4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by 2030. "The scale and scope of these buildouts presents significant long-term growth opportunities for Nvidia," she says. CEO Jensen Huang and CFO Colette Kress are on the call, which begins with the executives reading prepared remarks. Afterward, the executives will field questions from analysts. "Coming off a new rally to all-time highs, being merely on the mark in terms of revenue simply wouldn't cut it for Nvidia this time around," wrote Thomas Monteiro, senior analyst at Investing.com. "Saying the stock was priced for perfection would be an enormous understatement, as it was, in fact, in need of another massive beat." "And even though the numbers once again came out very solid—particularly driven by another masterclass in datacenter growth and extremely hot demand across the board—the reality is that without the much-needed push from H20 sales in China, Nvidia simply cannot sustain the type of growth priced into its valuation. This remains true even against a favorable FX backdrop," he added. In a sign of its financial strength, Nvidia says its board approved $60 billion in share repurchases on Tuesday. That's the company's largest repurchase to date, topping the $50 billion it authorized last year. It also ranks among the biggest in US history — Apple holds the record with a $110 billion announcement in 2024. Share repurchases let companies buy back their own stock, reducing the number of shares on the market. That can boost earnings per share and often lifts a company's stock price — a win for investors. Critics say buybacks can also be a red flag if companies prioritize them over reinvesting in growth, like R&D. Nvidia appears to still be figuring out what the coming months look like for its China business. For now, Nvidia has removed any anticipated H20 sales to China from its third-quarter guidance. It did, however, still sell some H20 chips outside of the region in the current quarter. "In the second quarter of fiscal 2026, we benefited from a $180 million release of previously reserved H20 inventory related to the sale of approximately $650 million of H20 to an unrestricted customer outside of China," the company said. "There were no H20 sales to China-based customers in the second quarter." CEO Jensen Huang or CFO Colette Kress may go into greater detail on H20 on the 5 p.m. ET analyst call. Revenue: $46.74 billion, +56% y/y, estimate $46.23 billion (Bloomberg Consensus) Source: Bloomberg The stock fell 0.1% on Wednesday in a muted session as investors awaited second-quarter numbers. It closed the day less than 1% from a record high. The AI capex race is poised to continue; that's great news for Nvidia. Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Meta all announced increases to their capex plans during their quarterly earnings — even the usually frugal Apple is trying not to fall behind. OpenAI executives have recently discussed their company's insatiable appetite for GPUs. All of these trends are great news for Nvidia, which sees a large portion of its chips revenue driven by four unnamed clients that many assume to be Big Tech giants. Before its earnings release, Goldman Sachs analysts wrote that Nvidia's share price had previously rallied higher in the wake of larger capex spending. William Blair said that US-based hyperscalers are expected to spend roughly $398 billion in capex this year. By 2028, the firm expects that to grow to $503 billion. — Brent D. Griffiths Analysts and investors will be looking for updates on Nvidia's development of a more advanced chip to sell to China. Nvidia is working on a chip would be more powerful than the H20 to sell to China, according to a recent Reuters report. President Donald Trump recently suggested he may be open to Nvidia selling a more powerful GPU chip to China, although there are still regulatory barriers in the way as well as deep-rooted concerns among lawmakers regarding China's access to AI technology. — Ana Altchek Wall Street's concerns about an AI bubble are likely to hang over Nvidia's earnings. Nvidia, which has beaten expectations in 11 of the last 12 quarters, could put those fears to rest. If the chipmaker shows signs of slowing, it could also dial up the bubble talk even further. Last week, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman gave renewed voice to worries that some investors are overhyping AI. Big Tech and leading AI companies are in the thick of a capex spending war that is so massive that it is uplifting the entire US economy, driving GDP growth. During a dinner with reporters, Altman compared the current situation to the dot-com era. When that bubble burst in the early 2000s, roughly $5 trillion in market cap was wiped out. Some companies, including WorldCom and Pets.com, never returned. Critics of the AI bubble theory, including AMD's Lisa Su, have said that AI will bring about such massive changes that it only makes sense that such large investments are needed to fuel the emerging technology. — Brent D. Griffiths In more potentially bullish news for Nvidia, Saudi Arabia's flagship AI project, Humain, says it expects approval from the Trump administration to buy Nvidia chips, Semafor reports. The kingdom has poured billions into Humain, which is building some of the world's largest data centers. CEO Tareq Amin told Semafor that he expects Nvidia will be cleared to supply Humain. US export controls have so far limited its access. Humain's data centers currently run on chips from startup Groq. They've already sold out of capacity, in another sign of massive global demand for AI chips. The company expects to open its data centers in 2026, Bloomberg reported. — Charles Rollet President Trump reportedly offered a deal to ease restrictions on Nvidia selling H20 chips to China last month, a major win for Huang and the chipmaker, which has been entangled in trade tensions for several years. The reversal reportedly came with an agreement for the US government to get a 15% cut of the revenue from H20 sales to the region. Challenges still remain for Nvidia sales in China, though. Nvidia asked some of its suppliers, including Arizona-based Amkor Technology and South Korea's Samsung Electronics, to halt production related to the H20 chip, The Information reported on Thursday. Despite the deal with the Trump administration to resume selling its H20 chips to China, the Chinese government gave a directive to local tech companies to stop buying the GPUs due to security concerns, the report said. Analysts will be listening for more details about how Nvidia sees its business in China shaping up amid the tensions. — Ana Altchek Decades ago, Jensen Huang reportedly said that Nvidia needed "to kill" Intel. Now, the rival chipmaker has the US government in its corner. Under Trump's leadership, US taxpayers are now Intel's largest shareholder. According to "The Nvidia Way: Jensen Huang and the Making of a Tech Giant," Huang said in 1997 that Nvidia needed to eliminate Intel after it decided to make its own graphics chips. "They are going to put us out of business," Huang said, according to the book. "Our job is to go kill them before they put us out of business. We need to go kill Intel." Questions linger about how the Intel-US government partnership will work. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said before the deal was finalized that the White House wouldn't use its stake to pressure companies to do business with Intel, which has seen its share of the advanced chip market decline. Huang has led Nvidia to blow by its once-stronger competitor, but Intel now has a powerful backer in the US government, a topic that is likely to come up on the analyst call. — Brent D. Griffiths Demand for Nvidia's GB200 chip is expected to see a "significant acceleration" in sell-through shipments through July, with that momentum carrying through the second half of the year, Baird analysts wrote in a note. Nvidia is also readying to release its GB300 AI chip, which could launch as soon as late September. "The AI GPU competitive landscape remains very favorable to Nvidia for the second half as well as next year," the firm wrote in a note on Monday. Baird reiterated its "Outperform" rating on the stock and lifted its price target to $225 from $195 a share, implying 25% upside. In Nvidia's last earnings call, Huang said the chipmaker had more Blackwell orders than it had at its GTC conference. The CEO said Nvidia would be increasing its supply chain in the US and "building it here on shore." While companies typically can't shift supply chains overnight, analysts will likely want an update on the chipmaker's progress. — Ana Altchek Nvidia is likely to beat on revenue, JPMorgan said, estimating that the chipmaker would report $46 billion to $47 billion in revenue for the quarter. The bank also predicted that Nvidia would issue a $53 billion-$54 billion revenue guidance for the fourth quarter, thanks to healthy demand for its GB200 chip and Blackwell rack. "We believe near-term AI fundamentals are strong, driven by strong hyperscale capex spending. This trend is evident in the upward revision in capex during the Q2 2025 earnings season by the cloud/hyperscale companies, and the strong results/guidance telegraphed by other AI beneficiaries," the bank said in a note to clients on Monday. Analysts reiterated their "overweight" rating on the stock. Chinese semiconductor company Cambricon reported record profit in the first half of the year, with revenue reaching $402 million. Although that's still far below Nvidia's $44 billion revenue from last quarter, it marks significant progress as one of several local competitors gaining ground while Nvidia works to maintain its dominance in the region. Huang may face questions about how he plans to maintain an edge in China, especially amid ongoing US-China trade tensions. — Ana Altchek Analysts at Stifel said they expected Nvidia to beat earnings estimates for the quarter and post "healthy" guidance for the third quarter, thanks to strong demand for its chips. "The longer-term bull-case emphasizes that AI-driven demand will remain robust and NVDA should maintain their market leadership in AI-accelerators into circa-2030 at the very least," they wrote. They continued: "As it stands today, we lean more toward the bull case, while underscoring that supply-side risk (including tariffs and trade regulations) is the key overhang to the name." Analysts reiterated their "Buy" rating on the stock and raised their price target to $212 from the prior $202, implying 18% upside. Evercore analysts said they expected AI capex to soar 72% in 2025, adding that cloud demand at companies like Amazon and Azure suggested that AI "hit a tipping point at enterprises." Industry checks also suggest there's strong demand for Nvidia's Blackwell product line, and that the company's software remains the "solution of choice" for training large language models. "NVDA remains our top pick, near-term due to improving visibility, longer-term, as we believe it could ultimately capture up to 16% weighting of the S&P 500 Index," they added. At the time analysts wrote the note, Nvidia made up around 8% of the benchmark index. Evercore reiterated its "Outperform" rating on the stock and lifted its price target to $214 a share from $190 a share, implying 19% upside from current levels.

Title: Is Passive Investing Creating A Bubble?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/wesmoss/2025/08/26/is-passive-investing-creating-a-bubble/
Time Published: 2025-08-26T11:37:08Z

ByWes Moss, Contributor. Is one of the most popular investing strategies quietly distorting the stock market? As index funds attract trillions, several outlets—including Barron’s and Harper’s Magazine—have voiced concern that a passive investing bubble could be forming. The core argument is that too much money is chasing too few stocks. Passive investing—through index mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs)—has become so dominant that it funnels an enormous volume of investor capital into a shrinking pool of mega-cap names such as Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, and Meta, for example, which often sit at the top of major index fund holdings. Because these funds are market-cap weighted, larger stocks attract proportionally more capital. That can create a feedback loop, where rising stock prices trigger more buying, which in turn pushes prices higher. Critics, such as Michael Green of Simplify Asset Management, warn that this dynamic may warp prices and inflate a bubble that could burst if flows reverse. They also worry that because index funds are essentially buy-and-hold vehicles, they don’t actively contribute to price discovery—the process that determines what a stock is truly worth based on supply and demand. Yet others push back. Steve Johnson at Financial Times, for instance, notes new research suggesting the “…surge in passive money has made equity markets more efficient, contradicting some previous research that has found the opposite.” Zooming out provides more perspective. According to Boston Consulting Group, global assets under management (AUM) hit $128 trillion by the end of 2024. Passive strategies grew to 20% of total global AUM by the end of 2024. There’s no doubt these figures are substantial, but they are far from overwhelming. While recent estimates indicate that systematic and passive strategies combined make up more than 60% of daily U.S. equity trading volume, pure passive index-tracking flows appear to represent a much smaller portion. In Q1 2023, ETFs—including both passive and active funds—comprised 32% of U.S. equity trading volume, according to the ICI 2024 Fact Book (p. 61). Even at the end of 2023, passive index-tracking mutual funds and ETFs accounted for just 18% of total U.S. stock market ownership—a figure that may rise to 30–35% when including other passive strategies—keeping in mind that while ownership data helps gauge influence, it doesn’t directly reflect how often positions are traded. This highlights a key point: truly passive flows are only a subset of ETF activity and likely make up a modest portion of total market turnover. Passive investing began gaining traction in 1976, when Vanguard founder Jack Bogle launched the first retail index mutual fund. Since then, index-based strategies have become a cornerstone of modern portfolio construction. By offering typically lower costs, broad market exposure, and built-in diversification, passive investing has attracted significant inflows from investors seeking long-term, market-matching performance. And despite concerns to the contrary, price discovery still occurs. Even when passive holds a sizable chunk of assets, active traders can still dictate equity and bond values. Hedge funds, portfolio managers, and individual investors continue to trade billions of dollars daily based on earnings reports, valuations, and other market signals. This activity helps play a critical role in maintaining market efficiency. Morningstar's March 2024 U.S. Active/Passive Barometer analyzed over 9,000 unique U.S. funds representing $23 trillion in assets—about 68% of the U.S. fund market. Yes, passive funds have attracted more inflows for nine straight years, but active funds still account for more than half of total U.S. assets. So, while passive investing is significant—and growing—it doesn’t appear to be the all-consuming force some critics make it out to be. Regardless of the rise in passive allocation, active investing is anticipated to continue playing a vital role for many reasons. Individuals pursue hands-on strategies in an attempt to beat the market, to invest in their values, to take activist positions, or even because they think they can outsmart their peers. In short, investors generally do continue to care about their money, suggesting active management is likely to remain relevant. The real surprise? Active managers outperformed passive funds far more often than headlines might suggest. Referring back to Morningstar’s March 2024 Active/Passive Barometer: As long as active funds are beating their benchmarks, market dynamics reasonably imply continued participation from investors, portfolio managers, and institutions actively trading, researching, and trying to outperform. For those concerned that algorithmic or computer-driven trading may fuel a passive bubble, it’s worth noting that these technologies have been embedded in market operations for decades. Rather than introducing a new risk, they’ve long been a foundational part of how modern markets function. While vigilance is warranted, the evidence suggests that market concentration risks are manageable. Passive investing does come with its own set of risks, as does any strategy. But data and market history indicate abundant competition from active investors, which doesn’t support the idea that current trends are inflating a bubble. There is clearly still sustained interest in active investing, which suggests a low probability of the market losing its ability to function properly. The fact that 42% of active funds beat their passive peers in all categories in 2024, and even more so in real estate and bonds, underscores how active management remains a key force in price discovery, even as passive strategies grow. Investors are expected to continue utilizing passive strategies as one piece of a thoughtfully constructed portfolio that often includes active avenues as well. Passive investing isn’t perfect, but the data fail to support the argument that it poses an imminent systemic risk.

Title: OpenAI taps Instagram and Doximity execs to lead its next AI healthcare push
URL: https://www.businessinsider.com/openai-taps-doximity-cofounder-to-lead-its-next-healthcare-push-2025-8
Time Published: 2025-08-26T09:00:01Z

OpenAI is ramping up its push into healthcare with two high-profile new hires. The AI powerhouse has tapped Nate Gross, the cofounder and former chief strategy officer of Doximity, and Ashley Alexander, former co-head of product at Instagram, to lead the next phase of its healthcare business. Gross joined OpenAI in June, while Alexander assumed her role on Tuesday, according to their LinkedIn profiles. An OpenAI spokesperson said Gross will lead OpenAI's go-to-market strategy in healthcare, with early goals including co-creating new healthcare technologies with clinicians and researchers. Alexander will be a vice president of product in OpenAI's health business, building tech for individual consumers and clinicians, the spokesperson said. Until now, OpenAI has mostly powered other companies' products and partnered on medical AI research, rather than competing directly with its own healthcare tech. But the company has been telegraphing its expanding healthcare ambitions for months. CEO Sam Altman spotlighted ChatGPT's healthcare skills during the August launch of GPT-5, calling the model "a legitimate Ph.D. expert." "It can help you understand your healthcare and make decisions on your journey," Altman said, adding that GPT-5 performed "exceptionally well" on health-related questions. That performance was validated by HealthBench, OpenAI's first stand-alone healthcare tool, released in May. The open-source benchmark lets health systems, startups, and tech firms evaluate the accuracy and safety of health AI applications. OpenAI's healthcare ambitions reflect a larger pivot: OpenAI wants to own not just foundation models but also the infrastructure and AI applications built on top of them. In education, it launched Study Mode, a ChatGPT spinoff for students, in July to compete with Google's Gemini for Education. It demoed an AI sales agent in February, and rolled out an agentic tool that books reservations and shops for users in July. Healthcare AI is already crowded with tech giants. Palantir began developing AI for hospitals in 2021. Microsoft launched cloud-based clinician tools in 2020 and has since deepened ties with medical-records giant Epic to use AI in notetaking. Gross and Alexander's new roles at OpenAI aim to help the AI juggernaut pick up the pace. The OpenAI spokesperson said the company thinks "improving human health will be one of the defining impacts of AGI." Gross has deep roots in digital health. He cofounded Doximity 15 years ago as a "LinkedIn for doctors." In 2023, Doximity launched Doximity GPT, built on OpenAI tech, to help physicians with administrative tasks. So far this year, Doximity has acquired AI clinical evidence company Pathway Medical for $63 million and launched its own free AI scribe to compete with the likes of Microsoft and $5.3 billion startup Abridge. Doximity is one of the few healthcare companies that went public in 2021's IPO frenzy that isn't currently in the red. Despite significant share price fluctuations in the past four years, Doximity's stock is up over 60% above its opening price at IPO. Gross is also the cofounder of digital health investment and research firm Rock Health. Alexander worked at Meta for 12 years, 11 of which she spent on Instagram's product team, building out many of the app's features for advertising, creator monetization, and video content. OpenAI's health AI research to date has been spearheaded by Karan Singal, a former Google researcher who helped lead the development of the tech giant's medical LLM Med-PaLM. Singal will continue to run OpenAI's healthcare AI research, the OpenAI spokesperson said. OpenAI is hiring for at least two other roles in its health business. Its careers page lists openings for a health AI research scientist and a healthcare software engineer. Despite its plans to compete more directly with health startups, OpenAI isn't ditching its partnerships. The company most recently announced a collaboration with Kenyan primary care provider Penda Health in July to assess Penda Health's AI clinical copilot built on OpenAI's GPT-4o. It also continues to power the technology behind companies like pediatric care startup Summer Health and health insurtech Oscar Health. Jump to

Come for the politics, stay for the snark. by Anne Laurie| August 25, 20256:53 pm| 11 Comments This post is in: Excellent Links, Grifters Gonna Grift, Science & Technology, Trump Crime Cartel Palantir has been getting a huge number of deals like this, in what is extremely obviously self-dealing. [image or embed] — Aaron Reichlin-Melnick (@reichlinmelnick.bsky.social) August 13, 2025 at 2:47 PM === I mean, when you wear the VP on your arm like the skin-puppet he is, why wouldn't you capitalize on that? — David (@dkboyd.bsky.social) August 13, 2025 at 3:27 PM I’ve been curious, and I thought y’all might be too. From Wired, “What Does Palantir Actually Do?”: Palantir is arguably one of the most notorious corporations in contemporary America. Cofounded by libertarian tech billionaire Peter Thiel, the software firm’s work with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the US Department of Defense, and the Israeli military has sparked numerous protests in multiple countries. Palantir has been so infamous for so long that, for some people, its name has become a cultural shorthand for dystopian surveillance. But a number of former Palantir employees tell WIRED they believe the public still largely misunderstands what the company actually does and how its software works. Some people think it’s a data broker that buys information from private companies and resells it to the government. Others think it’s a data miner, constantly scanning the internet for unique insights it can collect and market to customers. Still others think it maintains a giant, centralized database of information collected from all of its clients. In reality, Palantir does none of these things, but the misconceptions continue to persist… The problem, however, is that even ex-employees struggle to provide a clear description of the company. “It’s really hard to explain what Palantir works on or what it does,” says Linda Xia, who was an engineer at Palantir from 2022 to 2024. “Even as someone who worked there, it’s hard to figure out, how do you give a cohesive explanation?” Xia was one of 13 former Palantir staffers who signed an open letter published in May arguing that the company risks being complicit in authoritarianism by continuing to cooperate with the Trump administration. She and other former Palantir staffers who spoke to WIRED for this story argue that, in order to grapple with Palantir and its role in the world, let alone hold the company accountable, you need to first understand what it really is… Juan Sebastián Pinto, who worked as a content strategist at Palantir and also signed the open letter, says it sells software to other businesses, a category commonly referred to in Silicon Valley as B2B SaaS. Another former staffer says Palantir provides “really extravagant plumbing with data.” Xia calls Foundry, one of Palantir’s flagship software platforms, “a collection of different applications” that customers use to “operationalize data.” A fourth ex-employee dubbed Foundry a “super-charged filing cabinet.” While all of these descriptions are technically accurate, they could also apply to products from hundreds of other tech companies. So what sets Palantir apart? Part of the answer may lie in Palantir’s marketing strategy. Pinto says he believes that the company, which recently began using the tagline “software that dominates,” has cultivated its mysterious public image on purpose. Unlike consumer-facing startups that need to clearly explain their products to everyday users, Palantir’s main audience is sprawling government agencies and Fortune 500 companies. What it’s ultimately selling them is not just software, but the idea of a seamless, almost magical solution to complex problems. To do that, Palantir often uses the language and aesthetics of warfare, painting itself as a powerful, quasi-military intelligence partner. “Palantir is here to disrupt and make the institutions we partner with the very best in the world,” Palantir CEO Alexander Karp says in a February 2025 earnings call, “And when it’s necessary, to scare enemies, and on occasion, kill them.”… Underneath the jargon and marketing, Palantir sells tools that its customers—corporations, nonprofits, government agencies—use to sort through data. What makes Palantir different from other tech companies is the scale and scope of its products. Its pitch to potential customers is that they can buy one system and use it to replace perhaps a dozen other dashboards and programs, according to a 2022 analysis of Palantir’s offerings published by blogger and data engineer Ben Rogojan. Crucially, Palantir doesn’t reorganize a company’s bins and pipes, so to speak, meaning it doesn’t change how data is collected or how it moves through the guts of an organization. Instead, its software sits on top of a customer’s messy systems and allows them to integrate and analyze data without needing to fix the underlying architecture. In some ways, it’s a technical band-aid. In theory, this makes Palantir particularly well suited for government agencies that may use state-of-the-art software cobbled together with programming languages dating back to the 1960s. Palantir began gaining steam in the 2010s, a decade when corporate business discourse was dominated by the rise of “Big Data.” Hundreds of tech startups popped up promising to disrupt the market by leveraging information that was now readily available thanks to smartphones and internet-connected sensors, including everything from global shipping patterns to the social media habits of college students. The hype around Big Data put pressure on companies, especially legacy brands without sophisticated technical know-how, to upgrade their software, or else risk looking like dinosaurs to their customers and investors… Palantir’s software is designed with nontechnical users in mind. Rather than relying on specialized technical teams to parse and analyze data, Palantir allows people across an organization to get insights, sometimes without writing a single line of code. All they need to do is log into one of Palantir’s two primary platforms: Foundry, for commercial users, or Gotham, for law enforcement and government users. Foundry focuses on helping businesses use data to do things like manage inventory, monitor factory lines, and track orders. Gotham, meanwhile, is an investigative tool specifically for police and government clients, designed to connect people, places, and events of interest to law enforcement. There’s also Apollo, which is like a control panel for shipping automatic software updates to Foundry or Gotham, and the Artificial Intelligence Platform, a suite of AI-powered tools that can be integrated into Gotham or Foundry. Foundry and Gotham are similar: Both ingest data and give people a neat platform to work with it. The main difference between them is what data they’re ingesting. Gotham takes any data that government or law enforcement customers may have, including things like crime reports, booking logs, or information they collected by subpoenaing a social media company. Gotham then extracts every person, place, and detail that might be relevant. Customers need to already have the data they want to work with—Palantir itself does not provide any. A former Palantir staffer who has used Gotham says that, in just minutes, a law enforcement official or government analyst can map out who may be in a person’s network and see documents that link them together. They can also centralize everything an agency knows about a person in one place, including their eye color from their driver’s license, or their license plate from a traffic ticket—making it easy to build a detailed intelligence report. They can also use Gotham to search for a person based on a characteristic, like their immigration status, what state they live in, or whether they have tattoos… In some ways, Palantir can be seen as an amplifier of people’s intentions and biases. It helps them make evermore precise and intentional decisions, for better or for worse. But this may not always be obvious to Palantir’s users. They may only experience a sophisticated platform, sold to them using the vocabulary of warfare and hegemony. It may feel as if objective conclusions are flowing naturally from the data. When Gotham users connect disparate pieces of information about a person, it could seem like they are reading their whole life story, rather than just a slice of it. “It’s a really powerful tool,” says one former Palantir employee. “And when it’s in the wrong hands, it can be really dangerous. And I think people should be really scared about it.” ****** I quite enjoyed the Economist's article on Palantir: "Palantir might be the most overvalued firm of all time What would make it worth buying?" So sad to see the bubble bursting at bit. So very sad. www.economist.com/finance-and-… [image or embed] — notsewmot.bsky.social (@notsewmot.bsky.social) August 20, 2025 at 6:34 PM The Economist asks, “What Would Make It Worth Buying?” … No one can accuse Palantir, a data-analysis outfit and the most searingly hot stock of 2025, of unspectacular growth. It reported revenue of $1bn for the second quarter of this year, 48% higher than for the second quarter of 2024 and quadruple the figure for the same period in 2020. Silicon Valley types seek out companies satisfying the “rule of 40”, meaning that the sum of their operating margin and year-on-year sales growth, both expressed in percentage points, is higher than 40. Palantir’s score on that measure is 94: higher than any other enterprise-software firm with equivalent or greater sales. Among the world’s 25 biggest companies by market value—of which Palantir is one—only Nvidia, with its near-monopoly on artificial-intelligence chips, scores higher. Any investor would want a piece of that. The trouble is that Palantir’s market value has already soared to $430bn (see chart 1), more than 600 times its past year’s earnings and nearly triple the equivalent multiple for Cisco (or, indeed, Nvidia) at its peak. Software firms often prefer to express their valuation in terms of underlying sales, which puts Palantir’s multiple at around 120. For comparison, in 2005, the year before the Oxford English Dictionary added the verb “Google”, Google’s price-to-sales ratio peaked at 22. You need not look far to explain why Adam Parker of Trivariate Research, an investment firm, has published a note entitled “Could Palantir be the best short idea?” Writing in late May, he examined the ratio of enterprise value (which adjusts market value to account for debt and cash on the balance-sheet) to forecast sales for the coming year. On this measure Palantir then scored 73 and now scores 104. Mr Parker looked for other listed companies that had hit a multiple of 70 since 2000. Excluding financial firms and those with annual revenue of less than $50m, he found 14, the largest of which has a market value around a quarter of Palantir’s. That was Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy), a firm that sells some software but pitches itself to investors as a “bitcoin treasury company”, with a value derived from its cryptocurrency holdings rather than its sales… What, then, would it take to make Palantir’s shares worth buying? The firm helps everyone from spooks to fast-food chains analyse their data better and thereby improve their operations. Its blistering recent growth comes, in large part, from enthusiasm over adopting AI for such purposes. Palantir’s competitive advantage derives not just from its software and clever engineers, but from a high-level security clearance allowing it to process classified information from America’s defence and intelligence agencies. This gives it a “moat” with which to fend off competitors… Sustained revenue growth of that magnitude or more is possible, even at Palantir’s scale: Google (now called Alphabet), Meta and Nvidia have all managed it. Yet none was priced to do so in advance—and they are, after all, among the most successful firms in history. On a call with analysts and investors after announcing Palantir’s most recent results, Alex Karp, the chief executive (pictured), admitted that “this is a once in a generation, truly anomalous quarter.” The remarkable thing is that shareholders need the company’s revenue to continue to grow at a similar rate just to have a good chance of breaking even. There is no allowance for an upstart competitor, a scandal that makes clients wary or even a mere slowdown. If any of those strike, Cisco will need to make way for a new cautionary tale. Once we turf out the current batch of malefactors, could an honest administration pull Palantir’s vaunted security clearance, possibly while Peter Thiel stands before a Truth & Reconciliation Commission? ****** Fairness requirement: Strenuous argument against Palantir’s whole existence: Palantir: the world’s most evil company open.substack.com/pub/politica… [image or embed] — Ck (@ck-100.bsky.social) August 13, 2025 at 6:40 PM Filter No commenters available.

Tolkien, who is both FAR more honorable and FAR more significant than they ever will be! Old School August 25, 2025 at 7:05 pm I’m unclear as to whether Palantir is actually capable of producing the Navy and Air Force projects. Or is completion not really a deciding factor here? bbleh August 25, 2025 at 7:08 pm @Old School: this being the Trump era (see also Musk, Elon), I’m guessing that actually DOING things as opposed simply to talking about them and scooping up money from the gullible is … not a priority.

Get into Apollo, and you can covertly push malware into the data analytics software of securocracies and tech companies in the US and abroad. I sincerely hope they take their security very seriously. Dorothy A. Winsor August 25, 2025 at 7:35 pm I saw the headline and thought “the palantir is a communication device.” But no. Wrong universe. Martin August 25, 2025 at 7:54 pm @Old School: Hard to tell without more details. But Palantir basically specializes in recognizing a companies technical debt, and rather than helping a company solve it, just layer a new system on top that uses AI, etc. to try and replicate what your system ought to be doing, but in a different way. For instance in my career I was fairly notorious for building tools that could solve problems that the maintainers of the data couldn’t do. Their systems were collect information on students, or research expenditures, or payroll, etc but the tools weren’t designed to give broad insights on what was happening in those areas. They were useful for tracking A student, or A grant, or AN employee, but not seeing larger patterns. One way to solve that problem is to rework your tools so they are capable of doing that, but these tools are generally designed to enforce processes, and as such they are the laws of your organization in code, and reworking them can be very expensive, because any departures from how they worked before are effectively rewriting the laws of your organization. When I wasn’t part of the group responsible for the tool, but was tasked with providing the insight, rewriting the tools wasn’t an option – I didn’t own that system. Instead, I’d scrape that system in one way or another – pull from their dataset if I could get that permission, but as a last resort simply build a tool that emulated an employee accessing their tool and just scrape records from their UI. And from their data build a new tool that was designed to give the insight we needed – focusing on groups of students, demographics, categories of research or faculty, etc. You don’t need to rewrite the tool this way. It’s a way for an organization to neglect their technical debt a while longer but also can help an organization see the need to abstract their policy enforcement through code from their data from their code analysis. This is kind of what the microservices design pattern seeks to do as well. It’s not a bad approach, though if you are using it to neglect your technical debt it’s bad. Palantir does two things, from what I understand: Marc August 25, 2025 at 8:32 pm A year or so after 9/11 I was working on code with the PhD students for an “NSF” grant (we used to go to the sponsor’s meetings at the Ft Meade Travelodge) to look at communications flow between teams of workers on massive construction projects (nuclear plants, transit systems, etc.). This involved collecting massive amounts of metadata (no content) associated with email, CAD file updates, project change orders, and milestone completions. With some statistical analysis that could converted into an abstract model of the actual (as opposed to formal) organizational structure that would drive a simulation. Then we’d run the simulation thousands of times using genetic and ML algorithms to determine the “optimal” organizational structures for cost/schedule on future similar projects. Or, you could also figure out whom to remove to ensure that a project would never reach completion. That, among other things, is what Palantir does. JaneE August 26, 2025 at 12:33 am I don’t understand how Palantir could “overhaul antiquated human resources systems” if all it does is extract the old data from the existing antiquated system and give the users tools to generate analyses and give them better access to the old data. It would be a band-aid for the old system to let the users have better data until the system were overhauled. At that point the users would have the choice of whatever the newer system offered or let Palantir hoover up the new data to generate their analyses and reports. How does Palantir add new information if they don’t actually change the old system? I worked on those antiquated systems when they were new. Unless they actually have been updated to the newer languages and database structures getting information out is limited by what can be put in in the first place. If they already have all the data they need and just want to get additional views of the information without the time of programming it this might be a good solution, but that doesn’t sound like what the scrapped project was doing. Even if the Palantir solution is a good fit for what they want(ed) to do, this scrapping 12 years (and who knows how many man-years) of work because they want a specific (well connected politically) company to be given a chance to bid sounds like a totally corrupt deal. They didn’t bid 12 years ago – for whatever reason – so scrapping the current contractor really is nothing but political. Do the procurement regulations allow that type of patronage contracting? Aaron August 27, 2025 at 1:12 am @JaneE: Sounds like a good time to be wrapping up a boatload of acquisition deregulation, doesn’t it? Your email address will not be published.

Title: Can Meta Platforms Stock Hit $800 By The End Of 2025?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/can-meta-platforms-stock-hit-800-by-end-2025/
Time Published: 2025-08-25T19:51:08Z

ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. Given Meta Platform’s strong Q2 performance, modest valuation compared to Google and Microsoft, and optimistic growth forecasts, Meta stock is likely to top $800 within weeks. Whether the stock continues to rise depends on whether the company reports Q3 results that beat expectations and raises its forecasts for Q4 growth and profitability. If Meta falls short on Q3 growth or Q4 guidance, the stock could tumble way below $800 by the end of 2025. Read on for a discussion of how much Meta’s stock has risen so far this year, the forces propelling and impeding the company’s growth, how the Facebook parent’s valuation compares to rivals and where analysts see the stock going in the next year. Meta stock has been on a roll. In 2024, shares of the Facebook parent increased 69% – rising from $354 to $600 a share. As of August 25, Meta shares had risen another 26% to $755. With a mere 3% more to rise to reach $800 a share, Meta appears more likely than not to surpass that target by the end of 2025. Meta's strategic focus on artificial intelligence and its strong core advertising business, coupled with a vast user base, present significant growth opportunities for the company. Meta's core ad business remains robust, with strong revenue growth in 2025 driven by AI-enhanced ad targeting, increased advertiser adoption of AI tools and higher engagement across platforms like Facebook, Instagram and Threads. AI integration has led to increased conversion rates for ads, particularly on Reels, according to AInvest. Meta continues to see growth in Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and Threads with daily active users growing 6% to 3.48 billion in Q2 2025. Improved content recommendation algorithms and features like Reels contribute to increased time spent on the platforms, further enhancing the advertising opportunity, Zacks noted. Meta's aggressive investments in AI infrastructure, including data centers and AI models like Llama 4, could help the company’s business lines grow. The Meta AI chatbot and assistant are gaining traction, nearing one billion monthly active users, suggesting potential for AI-driven experiences and new revenue streams. Meta's AI strategy also includes AI-powered glasses and potential enterprise applications for businesses, SeekingAlpha wrote. Meta posted 22% revenue growth in the second quarter, showing its core ad business remains strong at a time when the company is investing billions of dollars into AI. The results show the extent to which Meta’s advertising business will continue to pay for its outsize AI ambitions, as well as how the AI tools are contributing to its strength, according to the Wall Street Journal. Meta beat analyst expectations and increased guidance. Sales came in at $47.5 billion, ahead of analyst expectations. Net income for the second quarter was $18.3 billion, also ahead of market expectations. Cost-cutting measures and a focus on efficiency also contributed to Meta’s healthy financial position, the Journal noted. Meta also said it expects to post between 17% and 24% revenue growth for the current quarter. “The investments it’s making in AI are already paying off in its ads business,” eMarketer principal analyst Jasmine Enberg told the Journal. Meta also faces hurdles — including regulatory pressures, high capital expenditures for AI and the continued losses in its Reality Labs division. Meta faces intense competition in both the social media and digital advertising sectors from established players like Google and emerging platforms like TikTok, as well as from new entrants in AI. TikTok is a significant threat to Meta's social media dominance and the Facebook parent’s ability to attract advertising. Google and OpenAI are key competitors in the development of AI capabilities, particularly regarding large language models, according to Variety. Meta faces many regulatory challenges, particularly in the European Union and the United States. The European Digital Markets Act could reduce Meta’s European ad revenue in the second half of 2025, according to Team SciDA, while an ongoing FTC antitrust lawsuit poses the risk of forced divestitures of Instagram and WhatsApp, reported Wired. The Reality Labs division, Meta's metaverse and VR/AR segment, continues to operate at a significant loss, raising questions about its long-term viability and return on investment. Meta's Reality Labs division reported $4.53 billion in the second quarter of 2025, despite generating $370 million in revenue, according to Digital Music News. This loss is a result of investments in VR and AR technologies, including the Meta Quest headsets and Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses. Meta's increased capital spending for AI infrastructure (estimated between $64 billion and $72 billion for 2025) could pressure margins and profitability in the short term, according to InvestorsObserver. It remains to be seen whether these large capital investments will result in a better return on investment than has the company’s investments in the metaverse — which prompted the company’s name change from Facebook. While sporting a moderate valuation compared to peers, Meta’s stock price, revenue growth, and net margin have outpaced those of Google and Microsoft. Here are the details: Based on short-term price targets offered by 52 analysts, the average price target for Meta Platforms comes to $866.92. The forecasts range from a low of $658.00 to a high of $1,086.00. The average price target represents an increase of 10.84% from the last closing price of $782.13, according to Zacks Research. One analyst was impressed with Meta’s Q2 report – raising his high price target to $900. "What was that? WOW," Bernstein analyst Mark Shmulik said in a client note featured by Investor’s Business Daily. "Meta destroyed expectations with perhaps one of the biggest prints in their history." Wedbush's Meta stock analyst Scott Devitt raised his price target from $750 to $920, reported IBD. Meta stock needs to rise 3% more to top $800 by the end of 2025. It is likely that will happen as long as Meta beats growth expectations and raises guidance when it presents its next earnings report.

Title: Which Mag Seven Stocks Should You Own?

ByBill Sarubbi, Contributor. The market is likely to close the year at new highs. Here is the reasoning: Edgar Laurence Smith described the decennial pattern in the 1930s. He found that specific years in each decade had brought regular stock market patterns. For example, years ending in zero had the worst returns while years ending in five have had the best. Years ending in seven have tended to bring crises. The histogram of expected return below details the strength of fifth years based upon the Dow Jones average from 1885. As we can see, the remainder of 2025 has a bullish bias. 1-Dow Jones Monthly Histogram in Years Ending In Five September has historically been the weakest month of the year. However, the ‘five’ influence tends to keep the bear away in the autumn. Here are the bullish percentages (the likelihood that the market will rise) for autumn months for the DJIA since 1885: As we can see, this viewpoint projects higher prices in September-October. Which of the Magnificent Seven stocks should be held? In order to answer this question, relative strength, seasonal and dynamic cycles are analyzed. The unique and proprietary Cycles Research Relative Strength Value screen measures all stocks on the same basis. The seven stocks are ranked below versus the NASDAQ Composite. When reading the table, keep in mind that the NASDAQ value is 97.5. So, Tesla and Apple are lagging the benchmark. NVIDIA= 109.5 Meta= 104.6 Alphabet= 103.4 Microsoft= 99.7 Amazon= 98.7 Tesla= 96.1 Apple=94.0 Analysis is concentrated on top-ranked NVIDIA. The monthly cycle has been accurate in 2025. There is a cycle peak now leading to a low in September. In fact, September has been the fourth-weakest month in any year, so both the dynamic and the seasonal cycles point to lower prices. Add to positions in late September. 2-NVDA Monthly Cycle META’s relative strength began to rise in April, making it one of the stronger stocks in this group. Price and relative strength are at new highs. The coming months have not been strong, but this is based upon only 14 years of data. Besides, the monthly cycle below rises into December. Hold the shares. 3-META Monthly Cycle Alphabet is a mixed picture. Relative strength bottomed in May but has been inconsistent since 2024. The monthly cycle is at a peak now, suggesting that the next buy point is in October. Seasonality has not been very bullish in the second half of the year. The stock is unlikely to outperform the current leaders in the Mag 7. 4-Alphabet Monthly Cycle Microsoft’s relative uptrend began in February, earlier than the other Mag 7 stocks. This stock is one of the few that features an upturn in monthly momentum. The monthly cycle tops in September and falls into yearend. The sell cycles in this stock have been less accurate than the buy signals over the last year. The conclusion is that the share price will rise into yearend but may begin to underperform the other Mag 7 members. 5-Microsoft Monthly Cycle Amazon is seasonally strong in the second half of any year, and the monthly cycle is rising. This is the best cycle combination. In fact, September and November have been two of the most bullish months over the last 28 years. This stock is likely to rise in performance into yearend. Add to positions. 6-Amazon Monthly Cycle The relative strength of Tesla actually topped in May. From now into yearend, only November has shown exceptional strength. The dynamic monthly cycle declines into September, rises into early November and then declines again. It is doubtful that this stock will rise in strength versus its Mag 7 brethren. 7-Tesla Monthly Cycle Apple has been falling in relative terms through 2025. September has been the weakest month in any year over the last 45 years, up only 35% of the time. Note that the monthly cycle peaks now and declines into yearend. All three downturns in the last 12 months have brought the shares down. Underweight or sell this stock. 8-Apple Monthly Cycle

ByDanielle Chemtob, Forbes Staff andForbes Daily, Forbes Staff. As Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled long-awaited rate cuts could be coming, the world’s wealthiest became even richer. Powell’s comments at the central bank’s symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming spurred a broader stock market rally, as lower rates are expected to jolt the economy. The world’s richest person, Elon Musk, gained $9.3 billion in net worth, bringing his total to around $417 billion on Friday, while the second-wealthiest, Oracle CEO Larry Ellison, got a $4.4 billion boost. President Donald Trump has demanded a rate cut, but Powell warned that despite U.S. economic resilience, tariffs could “spur a more lasting inflation dynamic.” In an unusual move for the federal government, President Donald Trump said the U.S. will take a 10% stake in Intel worth roughly $10 billion, making it the third-largest shareholder in the struggling chipmaker. It’s one of the largest government interventions in an American company in more than a decade, when the U.S. injected billions of funds into automakers during the 2008 financial crisis. Judges in two courts have now found that the president of the United States took part in a yearslong fraud that deceived financial institutions about his net worth, but they differed on how much Trump should pay as a penalty. Last week, appellate justice Peter Moulton reduced Trump’s roughly $500 million penalty imposed by a judge in February to zero. Neither did much math to arrive at those numbers. MORE: The wiping out of Trump’s fine was also a win for billionaire Don Hankey, whose specialty insurance firm put up a $175 million bond for Trump last year while he was appealing the ruling. While Trump and Hankey had never met or directly done deals, Hankey, worth $7.8 billion, confirmed to Forbes last year that he supported Trump’s political campaigns and was the largest individual owner of the lender that refinanced mortgages for some of Trump’s properties. Most people invest in an index fund to diversify their portfolio—but when it comes to the benchmark S&P 500 these days, 28% of the value of the index is in just five stocks: Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and Meta, all of which have high price tags. To take a step back from the S&P 500, investors can instead purchase a total market fund, blend U.S. and foreign stocks, purchase bonds or consider ETFs that hold small- and mid-cap stocks. President Donald Trump said he would fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook if she doesn’t resign, as a Trump Administration official has accused her of mortgage fraud. Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte alleges Cook claimed two properties as her primary residence, but Cook has denied wrongdoing and said the mortgage application was from before she joined the Fed. The billionaire owner of OnlyFans is now worth $7.8 billion, double Forbes’ estimate from a year ago, as he earned more than $1.9 million a day from the site in 2024. And Leonid Radvinsky may be in for his biggest payout yet, as he is reportedly in talks to sell OnlyFans in a deal that would value the company at about $8 billion. President Donald Trump suggested he could again delay the deadline for TikTok to secure a U.S. buyer or face a ban. Trump called the national security concerns over the app owned by Chinese company ByteDance “highly overrated,” and suggested there are buyers lined up for TikTok. MORE: Even as TikTok continues to face the threat of a ban in the U.S., its business is growing elsewhere in the world. Outside the U.S., TikTok saw its revenues surge 38% to $6.3 billion last year, though it’s facing a litany of lawsuits and investigations from regulators globally. The theme park industry, like the broader travel sector, is on a bit of a roller coaster ride this year: Data shows that overall spending at U.S. theme parks was down 5% this summer compared to last year, mostly driven by a pullback from low- and middle-income parkgoers. Meanwhile, pricier destination theme parks run by Disney and Universal got a boost from affluent visitors, a trend mirrored in the rest of the industry. These days, Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong, America’s best-known pothead entertainers, are playing by the rules, as long as you ignore the federal laws regarding marijuana. In 2020, the duo, along with their business partners, launched two companies, California-based Cheech and Chong Cannabis Co., which licenses its brand, genetics, formulas and retail designs to marijuana companies, and Cheech and Chong’s Global Holding Company, a Nevada-based endeavor that sells hemp-derived products ranging from gummies to THC-infused drinks. In 2025, the companies’ combined revenue will hit nearly $100 million from both marijuana and hemp, up from about $50 million last year. The companies, which outsource manufacturing to third parties, are worth roughly $150 million. And as the U.S. cannabis market posted $32 billion in sales last year across 40 states, Cheech and Chong, if anybody, deserve a taste of the action. The pair are the godfathers of the stoner comedy genre thanks to Up In Smoke, their 1978 debut film followed by Nice Dreams and other movies, all of which influenced generations of films from Dave Chappelle’s Half Baked to Seth Rogen’s Pineapple Express. Celebrity cannabis brands do not typically do well, other than a few exceptions such as Mike Tyson’s Tyson 2.0 and Wiz Khalifa’s Khalifa Kush. But Cheech and Chong have a unique advantage—not only are they synonymous with weed, but they also have a massive fan base that spans generations. WHY IT MATTERS “Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong have been making people laugh for decades, but their cannabis business is no joke,” says Forbes staff writer Will Yakowicz. “With $100 million in combined revenue from their companies that sell marijuana and hemp products, Cheech and Chong are standouts when it comes to celebrity-founded cannabis companies. The duo’s fame and influence spans decades—from their 1978 debut film Up In Smoke to That 70s Show to Zootopia. While most celebrity weed brands flounder on the market, Cheech and Chong have built a strong brand with impressive sales within five years.” MORE The Kings Of CBD Are Now Cooking Up Plans To Make Billion-Dollar Meds From Cannabis And Mushrooms The gap between the earnings of workers and CEOs among the lowest-paying firms on the S&P 500 is growing, according to a report from the progressive think tank Institute for Policy Studies. The report found CEO pay is rising more than twice as quickly as that of the average worker: 12.9%: How much the average CEO-to-worker pay ratio widened between 2019 and 2024 6,666 to 1: Last year’s pay ratio gap at Starbucks, the company with the largest such disparity in the S&P 500 32: The number of billionaires who owe their wealth directly to companies in the Low-Wage 100, the S&P 500 corporations with the lowest median worker pay Gen Z is facing one of the worst job markets in recent history, but if you apply the right strategy to your search, it’s still possible to secure an offer. Branch out beyond jobs related only to your college degree, you might find possibilities you hadn’t considered. Don’t be afraid to pivot, and try to target recession-proof industries. A retail business that previously went bankrupt and closed its stores nationwide is planning a comeback, with 300 new locations in the works. What chain is it? A. Party City B. Bed Bath & Beyond C.

Title: Five Ways To Avoid The Five Hottest Stocks
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/baldwin/2025/08/25/five-ways-to-avoid-nvidia-microsoft-apple-amazon-and-meta/
Time Published: 2025-08-25T10:30:00Z
Full Content:
ByWilliam Baldwin, Senior Contributor. Indexitis: The nagging fear that too much of your net worth is invested in the S&P 500, and too much of that is invested in five exuberantly priced stocks. The affliction is becoming more common. The popular index has 28% of its value in Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon and Meta Platforms (i.e., Facebook). This is twice the top-five concentration level the index has had historically. Herewith are five cures for indexitis, ranging from a modest tweak to your choice of stock index fund to a dramatic move into one very interesting bond. Index investing is not necessarily a bad idea, and the market is not necessarily acting irrationally in putting high price tags on fast-growing tech firms. It is a tribute to the success of passive investing, to the investment company founded by the late John Bogle and to the popularity of artificial intelligence chips that we have a fund with a $107 billion holding in one stock. That’s the Vanguard S&P 500 fund’s position in Nvidia. But history tells us that mighty fortresses crumble. Forty years ago, the top three U.S. companies in market value were IBM, Exxon and General Electric. Their locations in today’s 500 are at positions 34, 14 and 26. Here are five ways to take a step back from the S&P 500. Important assumption: You’re rebalancing inside a tax-deferred account. In a taxable account with unrealized gains, the smart thing to do is nothing. Replace your S&P 500 index fund with a fund that owns the whole U.S. stock market. Customers of Fidelity Investments have access to the best deal, its Zero Total Stock Market fund, with a 0% expense ratio. Ticker: FZROX. Without a Fidelity account you’re better off in an exchange-traded fund; these can be held at any brokerage. Vanguard, Schwab and BlackRock (iShares) all have total market ETFs priced at 0.03% per year, meaning you pay $3 a year per $10,000 invested. Tickers, respectively: VTI, SCHB and ITOT. The total market funds have roughly 80% of their assets in the S&P 500. All you are accomplishing with this switch is adding a small allocation to smaller companies. The Fidelity fund has 2,100 of these small stocks, the Vanguard fund 3,000. You can find these alternative index funds in the domestic stock chapter of the Forbes Fund Finder. In lieu of a U.S.-only stock portfolio, you could have one that blends U.S. and foreign stocks. Obvious choice: the Vanguard Total World Stock ETF (VT, expense 0.06%). This fund has two-thirds of its money in North America, the rest abroad. VT’s portfolio of 9,980 stocks starts out looking like the S&P 500, with Nvidia at the top, but as you scroll down you’ll see names like Taiwan Semiconductor and Tencent Holdings. Instead of accepting Vanguard’s 34% allocation to stocks on other continents, you could set your own percentage by moving some money to a purely foreign portfolio. There are several good ETFs to pick from. Cheapest: SPDR Portfolio Developed World ex-U.S. (SPDW, 0.03%). It has 2,350 stocks, starting with ASML, which makes the machines that Taiwan Semiconductor uses to make chips for Nvidia. There are several low-cost ETFs that hold only small-capitalization stocks, or only small- and mid-cap. Cheapest: SPDR Portfolio S&P 600 Small Cap (SPSM, 0.03%). Its largest position is in Mr. Cooper Group, a fast-moving mortgage lender. Over the past five years, as the S&P 500 has almost doubled, one thing has gotten cheaper: a long-term inflation-protected bond. With a bond, “cheap” is synonymous with “high-yielding.” In August 2020, a 20-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Security (TIPS) was yielding -0.6%, which is to say, the government was charging you money for letting you lend to it. Now the yield is 2.5%, a huge 3.1-point swing in your favor. That’s a real yield, not to be compared with the nominal yield you see on a bank account or corporate bond. There are very good TIPS ETFs on the market but they tend to have short-term bonds. For a concentrated bet (and for a better real yield), go long. If you have at least $100,000 to invest, buy a TIPS in the secondary market. One that I like (because the bid/ask spread was narrow) is the 0.875% due in February 2047. At Fidelity it was recently quoted at 71.968 bid, 72.093 ask. These market prices must be multiplied by an inflation factor, and the bottom line on a ticket for 100 bonds (that is, $100,000 of par value when issued) would have been $96,470. These numbers are bit confusing, so here’s what counts. The real yield to maturity came to 2.57% for a buyer. The yield spread was 1 basis point (one-hundredth of a percentage point). If we presume that the true value is midway between bid and ask, you are in effect coughing up half a basis point of annual return to the middleman. That’s a better deal than the 3 basis points you pay to own an ETF, at least if you hold the bond to maturity. Long Treasury bonds are risky, because real rates could go still higher (making the bond’s value go down), and because the Treasury might default. But bonds are a lot less risky than today’s tippy toppy S&P 500.

A Change Of Heart Publishers are hopeful that Meta may have changed its tune at least somewhat when it comes to how – or whether – the platform reimburses publishers for content contributed to its LLM models. Following up on an IAB Tech Lab event at which Meta and Google participated alongside publishers, Digiday reports on cautious optimism among pubs that Meta’s recent hiring spree of AI engineering leaders has led to a greater appreciation of the value of original written content. That’s quite a different vibe than Meta was putting out there as recently as last year. Last September, on The Verge’s Decoder podcast, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that “creators or publishers tend to overestimate the value of their specific content.” Reading between the lines, if creators don’t want to participate in feeding AI models because they’re not being properly compensated, then maybe the AI models will just skip over them. Although, not to be a cynic, that might be a moot point, considering all the data scraping that’s been going on. Also, we’ll believe it when we see it – publicly. “They [Meta] were very clear that their stance on this has changed,” one anonymous publisher tells Digiday. “Even though it may not have outwardly turned into action yet.” Data (Fee) Leak Times are tough for The Trade Desk. Its stock price sank after investors questioned its strategy for competing with walled gardens. Meanwhile, competitors are gunning for their slices of open web advertising and the growing CTV and retail media markets. Now, a document leak has revealed what advertisers pay for targeting data sourced from TTD’s retail media partners, Adweek reports. The document, which was last updated June 15, also includes the minimum ad spend required to create custom audiences or conduct campaign measurement using retailer data. When advertisers use retail media data to target ads, they pay the retailer a percentage of the campaign’s CPM capped at a set amount. For example, targeting with Costco’s data might cost 40% of the CPM, but won’t exceed $4 per 1,000 impressions. It’s unclear whether TTD keeps a portion of the data fees for itself. The hard caps are in place because CPMs are much higher for CTV ad buys than online display campaigns, and retail media data is commonly used for CTV targeting. The leak also sheds light on TTD’s no-longer-exclusive ad tech partnership with Walmart’s DSP, including a $150,000 spending minimum and a 75-cent CPM fee for sales lift measurement. However, Walmart says those are old figures, so it’ll be interesting to see what other DSPs will charge for Walmart’s data. Giving Privacy The Finger Fingerprinting has a bad reputation. But opinions on the controversial tracking strategy seem to be shifting. The IAB Tech Lab is even defending it. Audience fingerprinting identifies and tracks devices or users based on unique digital traits like browser settings and software and hardware configurations, without relying on cookies or device IDs. A fingerprint can include everything from web browser type and version, a device’s operating system, the size of the screen, language settings and many other signals. Platforms combine these data points, none of which alone can specifically identify a person, to create a probabilistic user ID. Critics say fingerprinting threatens user privacy, since people can’t opt out. Apple, Mozilla, Microsoft and others prohibit the practice. But Google, which also once banned fingerprinting, reversed course back in January. And now the IAB Tech Lab is also waving away concerns. At the AdMonsters Sell Side Summit in Nashville last week, Tech Lab CEO Anthony Katsur gave a rundown of the trade org’s recent initiatives, including its new Trusted Server framework. In describing how the server uses first-party data to create synthetic IDs, Katsur acknowledged, but also diminished, criticisms that the framework promotes fingerprinting – perhaps drawing on his tense exchange with Sincera’s Mike O’Sullivan in March. “Oh, it’s fingerprinting,” he said in a mocking tone. “Sure, let’s fucking call it fingerprinting.” You heard the man! But Wait! There’s More! Publishers sing the AI scraping blues and detail their diversification efforts at Sell Side Summit Nashville. [AdMonsters] OpenAI has been using data from Google search results to power ChatGPT. [The Information] A sign of the times: Digg, once billed as the “front page of the internet,” is relaunching as an app-focused experience.

August 24, 2025 23:54 ET | Source: Faraday Future Faraday Future LOS ANGELES, Aug. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faraday Future Intelligent Electric Inc. (NASDAQ: FFAI) (“Faraday Future”, “FF” or the “Company”), a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company, today shared a weekly business update from YT Jia, Founder and Global Co-CEO of FF. “This is our 17th weekly update. Many of you have asked whether our “Dual Flywheel & Dual Bridge” eco-strategy could lead to distraction or drift. In fact, it is the opposite. This is not about losing focus, but about strengthening our foundation. Automaking is a long-cycle, high-investment, and slow-return industry. One of the core challenges FF is facing is that: before hitting positive operating cash flow, how do promote long-term and stable capital supply. Our C10 Treasury is designed for this. By accumulating and compounding the world’s Top 10 crypto coin portfolio, it has the potential to provide continuous and sustained capital support for our main business — EAI EV, truly delivering dual-engine growth from both capital and industry.” On Friday last week, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled that a rate cut may come as early as September. His remarks gave a major boost to capital markets. U.S. equities moved higher, while crypto reacted faster and stronger. The market priced in liquidity easing more directly, creating a clear upside for our C10 Treasury, as the C10 Index was up nearly 6% on Friday. This week, both flywheels achieved important progress: On S1 User Ecosystem: The influence of our “Dual Flywheel + Dual Bridge” unveiling event continues to grow in the U.S. It has sparked meta-chemistry. Cross-sector outreach in automotive, finance, and Web3 created a multi-domain resonance. As a result, FF and FX received cross-industry attention that far exceeded expectations. We will double our efforts to quickly elevate FF and FX’s influence in the U.S. market to another level. Looking at S2–S3: Product & Technology:This week, FX Super One successfully completed the first round of development tests for occupant upper interior impact protection under U.S. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS). FMVSS is recognized as one of the world’s most complete and rigorous automotive safety regulations. It is a prerequisite for entering the U.S. market and also sets standards for automotive design, manufacturing, and testing worldwide. FX Super One must meet the requirements of the U.S., the Middle East, and future global markets. This requires testing at the highest standards. We will continue advancing vehicle testing, development, and validation to build a strong foundation for Super One’s high safety standards. Moving on to S4, Product Execution & Delivery: This week, we visited the Hanford manufacturing facility to oversee FX Super One’s trial production. Thanks to the hard work of our manufacturing team, around 60% of the trial production process planning has already been completed. Next, the team will continue comprehensive validation of production processes, refine work procedures, establish and enhance the quality control system, and carry out dedicated skill training in parallel. Lastly, on S5 Capital Markets and finance:The first dedicated $30 million financing commitment for C10 Treasury closed this week. We expect to begin the first round of asset allocation next week. Our plan is to gradually deploy the full $30 million over the coming weeks. 80% will be allocated passively according to the C10 Index, while 20% will be actively managed. We will share portfolio holdings and performance updates in future weekly reports. C10 Treasury, as a short-cycle, fast-paced, high-value, and cash-cow investment due to steady staking interests, could serve as the financial engine of the entire listed company FFAI, and help accelerate the implementation and execution of the EAI EV strategy. Next week:Our Super One co-creation and sales campaign will officially kick off across eight U.S. states. Over the next weekend, I will make a short trip to the Nevada desert, bringing FX Super One to Burning Man. We also plan to announce an important update there. Burning Man has become a global utopia where leading minds in technology, art, and business pursue creativity and idealism. Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg are regulars there, and Google’s founders once recruited Eric Schmidt at Burning Man. Schmidt went on to lead Google for a decade, driving its rapid expansion and cementing Google’s dominance in the Web2 era. Starting August 28, Super One will also make its debut in Massachusetts, where we and our FF Par partners will host two consecutive co-creation and sales events in the Boston area. At the same time, our New York–based B2B partner Alps will launch a week-long roadshow campaign. On August 30, FF headquarters will host a special event — the inaugural North America “Go-Global Stand-Up Comedy Festival” and FX Super One Showcase. Joe Wong, the first Chinese stand-up comedian to have roasted a U.S. president live at the White House, will join entrepreneurs, founders, and global expansion pioneers for co-creation and exchange. We will see you next week!” ABOUT FARADAY FUTURE Faraday Future is a California-based global shared intelligent electric mobility ecosystem company.

Title: Dow eyes fresh highs as Nvidia gets set to report earnings amid AI bubble fears

Jason Ma is the weekend editor at Fortune, where he covers markets, the economy, finance, and housing. Stock futures edged up on Sunday evening as Wall Street looks ahead to another big week that will feature earnings from AI chip leader Nvidia and another inflation update. Markets are coming off a monster rally on Friday, when Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell opened the door to a rate cut next month. Futures tied to the Dow Jones industrial average rose 24 points, or 0.05%. S&P 500 futures were up 0.05%, and Nasdaq futures added 0.06%. On Friday, the Dow hit a new all-time high, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed in on their records. The yield on the 10-year Treasury was flat at 4.256% after diving Friday on rate-cut expectations. The U.S. dollar was down 0.02% against the euro and flat against the yen. Gold fell 0.13% to $3,413.80 per ounce. U.S. oil prices rose 0.2% to $63.79 per barrel, and Brent crude added 0.15% to reach $67.83. Friday’s stock surge came after a big selloff that was led by tech giants, as doubts have grown about the AI boom and how much it will actually help companies. That’s after a recent report from MIT found that 95% of AI pilot programs at businesses are failing to produce much of a return. Adding to those concerns were remarks from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who drew a parallel between today’s AI frenzy and the 1990s dotcom bubble. Wall Street’s faith in the staying power of AI as an investment thesis will be put to the test when Nvidia reports quarterly earnings after the close on Wednesday. The report also comes after Nvidia and AMD agreed to an unprecedented deal where they give the federal government a 15% cut of their chip sales to China. For now, demand from U.S. companies remains high as so-called hyperscaler tech giants Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta Platforms alone are expected to deploy $400 billion in capital expenditures this year, and most of that is going to AI. On Friday, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge is due as policymakers wait and see how much of an effect on inflation President Donald Trump’s tariffs are having. Earlier updates on the consumer price index and the producer price index were mixed, and analysts expect the personal consumption expenditures index for July to rise 0.2% on a monthly basis and 2.6% on a yearly basis, the same annual rate as June. But the core PCE is seen climbing 0.3% on a monthly basis and 2.9% on a yearly basis, accelerating from June’s 2.8% annual rate. Still, some Fed officials, including Powell, have indicated that tariff-related impacts on inflation may be short-term and that more attention should go to the labor market, which has shown signs of weakening. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited.

What I gave up, what I kept, and what's new. PLUS: How I'm using AI Once a summer for the past few years, I've taken a break from the news cycle to share a little about how I use technology to do my job. (Here's last year, and the year before.) Readers often tell me they look forward to posts like these, and so in the spirit of giving you more of what you want, here's what I learned about productivity in the past year. Just like last year, I'll offer a couple recommendations for software tools I've recently started using. (None of these recommendations are sponsored, incidentally.) But in an effort to offer a more complete picture of what it's like for me these days to get things done as a journalist and entrepreneur, I also want to talk about what I'm still doing, what I stopped doing, and why. Let's get into it. In my experience, most people use software tools only begrudgingly, and will go to great lengths to avoid ever having to learn a new one. For some percentage of tech enthusiasts, though, trying out new software is a hobby all unto itself. I count myself among this pathological second group, and will regularly drop everything to try out a new to-do app for no productive reason at all. For that reason, I think, the strongest case I can make for you about which software tools are truly useful involve the ones that I have continued to use for more than a year. With that in mind, I'm happy to say I'm still a more-or-less daily user of two apps I told you about last year. Raycast, a launcher app I began using on my Mac, continues to make navigating my laptop effortless. I simply type ⌘-space and can instantly open an app, perform a calculation, reposition my windows, access my clipboard history, look up a word's definition, and dozens of other things. But my favorite use of Raycast is still asking quick questions of AI (a paid upgrade): without ever leaving the tab I'm on, I can look up a quick fact, jog my memory, or get more context. And yes, I double-check any fact it gives me before putting it in the newsletter. But the amount of time and energy I save in context-switching continues to make Raycast a cherished companion. Raycast came to iOS this year, but in truth, I haven't found much use for it. The better news is that it is soon coming to Windows as well; you can sign up for the waitlist here. Capacities, a personal knowledge management app, continues to be my home base for daily planning, journaling, and lightweight task management. The app offers extensive features for folks who like to have dedicated structures and metadata for keeping track of the books they read, the people they meet, and the places they travel. It also has integrated AI chat, integrations with Todoist and other third-party apps, and a growing library of plug-ins built by its community. I've dabbled with those features, but none have stuck. What brings me back to Capacities is the value I find in taking a few minutes most mornings to write in my journal about work, life, and whatever else is on my mind. This clears my head and makes space for me to make a plan for the day, while also letting me noodle on ideas for the column and the podcast. I still do some lightweight tagging of people, topics, and ideas. But I've also come to trust my memory more; it turns out that my mind returning to a subject over and over again is a much more useful signal to me than seeing that I keep tagging the same idea or subject all over again. Or rather, by the time I'm tagging the same idea over and over in Capacities, it has already occurred to me that it's something to write about. And how hard would have it been to find all those stories I so meticulously added and tagged, anyway? Last year I talked about my experiments with Readwise, which I hoped would become a kind of AI librarian. The idea was that it would become a kind of next-generation Pocket, replacing the now-defunct read-it-later app with something more dynamic. It was especially useful at quickly parsing large PDFs, such as court decisions or NGO reports, allowing me to summarize and find relevant parts of the document much faster than I could do myself. It didn't stick. Like Pocket, Readwise turned out to be less of a read-it-later app than a read-it-never app — a place to save articles, books and other media with the best of intentions, and then never to look at it ever again. Summarizing and navigating through PDFs is now something any chatbot will do for you, and for free. Abandoning Readwise is part of an overall move I am making to collecting less stuff. In the past, it seemed obvious that slurping up every item of remote interest into a single database would eventually reap huge rewards for my intellect. And while I continue to investigate new approaches to that question — see below — on the whole I am trying to do less of it. I experimented with Lazy; I spent the past six months keeping a journal of stories about AI in Tana. The best thing I can say about these experiences is that they made it modestly easier to jog my memory about recent events involving a certain company or topic, thanks to the work I had put into tagging them. But doing so required a lot of manual effort, and for only a modest reward. Last month 404 Media's Jason Koebler wrote something that has haunted me ever since: "Where are the journalists who were formerly middling who are now pumping out incredible articles thanks to efficiencies granted by AI?" Koebler's question came as part of a broadside against feckless media executives betting that artificial intelligence will somehow save their businesses despite all current evidence to the contrary. But he also cast doubt on the idea that AI is transformative even at the individual level. I found myself agreeing with him. Like Koebler, I believe that AI is no kind of business model for journalism; and that any efficiencies that individual reporters are seeing from it are relatively modest. There is nothing that AI now does for me that I could not do myself. That said, there are things that AI does for me that I would now hate to do myself, and hope never to do again. There are also some things it can do better than I can, in most cases because it's simply much faster. Here are some of those things: For what it's worth, my most-used models are GPT-5 thinking (previously o3), and Gemini 2.5 Pro. GPT-5 is my daily workhorse, but I also think Gemini is underrated. (Did you know you can upload an audio file to it and it will create a very good transcription for you, and even clean up the filler words?) I find Claude less useful for the tasks above, but I do use it for personal stuff; it has the highest EQ of today's models. (See my ethics disclosure!) And before anyone asks — I do not use AI to draft columns or even to draft outlines. I started a newsletter because I like to write! Two years ago, I wrote this: This feature actually shipped a few months later. My early experiments with it had not gone well. But after interviewing Notion CEO Ivan Zhao for Decoder this month, I gave it another shot. And I'm happy to say that Notion delivered exactly what I was looking for in 2023: the ability to talk to the giant database of links I have stored in it over the past five years, grounded in the actual links and article text I have saved. I can give Notion a sprawling question like "how did the Cambridge Analytica case resolve" and get a good summary of regulatory actions across several years and countries. And by default, web search is off, meaning I know that its AI systems are drawing only on the vetted journalism that I have saved into my database. This is a dream come true. I finally have a meaningful way to sift through millions of words of article text, ask follow-up questions, and get citations that I can use in my work. Notion may yet prove to be the AI librarian that Readwise never became. One more thing I'm trying: I mentioned above that I continue to experiment with different ways to save material that might be useful later. Recently a Reddit post turned me on to Recall, which positions itself as a "self-organizing knowledge base." Currently available as a web and mobile app, Recall lets you save web pages, YouTube videos, PDFs, podcasts, Google Docs, and other materials into a single database that it then organizes on your behalf. Recall is largely redundant to Notion. But I love its interface, its speed, and its overall user experience. Lately, the CEOs I cover have all started doing two- to three-hour podcast recordings. With Recall, I can save the podcast with one click, have it instantly generate a summarized transcript with timestamps, and let the app automatically connect it to other relevant articles and podcasts in my database. It performs similarly well with PDFs of books, which I rarely have the time to read in their entirety, but can now skim using Recall's detailed summaries and decide whether I want to dig in deeper. Recall aims itself in part at students — it will also generate quizzes for you based on the material you save. And like basically every other productivity app today, it also has integrated AI chat, so you can ask questions about long documents and get grounded answers. I haven't been using Recall for long, but for the moment it is scratching my web-hoarding itch unlike anything else has quite been able to do to date. If I've learned one bitter lesson about this stuff over the years, it's that the best productivity hack in the world is simply liking your job. If you enjoy what you do, you will find ways to do it, and in 2025 almost any software remotely suited to the purpose will be more than good enough. On a fundamental level, every single to-do list app is exactly the same. But it's fun to try new things. And while I continue to waste countless hours and a fair bit of money doing so, I also feel like this pursuit keeps me connected to the state of the art. The Notion workspace I dreamed of two years ago is now here at my fingertips. The looming question, as ever, is what I will do with it. On the podcast this week: Kevin and I explore what it means that we're in an AI bubble. Then, Reuters' Jeff Horwitz stops by to discuss his blockbuster story about Meta's policy to let its chatbot engage in "sensual" roleplay with children.

Title: 6 Things To Know About The Meta/Google Cloud AI Deal
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnwerner/2025/08/23/6-things-to-know-about-the-metagoogle-cloud-ai-deal/

ByJohn Werner, Contributor. Meta’s new deal with Google for AI cloud hosting comes with a big price tag — the deal is reportedly worth $10 billion. That’s the equivalent of 666 million large pizzas — or two for each person in the U.S. It’s also equal to the GDP of a small country. So what’s behind this monolithic business agreement? Here are some interesting aspects of this newly announced tech partnership. The $10 billion deal with Google is part of a Meta plan to invest a total of over $100 billion in AI. Zuckerberg has repeatedly talked about this kind of scaling up, as the company lays off significant numbers of human workers, moves the survivors to departments that are heavier on AI and automates business processes like it’s going out of style. The proclaimed “Year of Efficiency” in 2023 saw a lot of this action, and Meta doesn’t seem to be slowing down. The deal also lasts until 2031, by which time we might have superhuman agents, godlike AGI and brand-new national economies built on crypto or some more out-there foundation. So you could be forgiven for imagining that, for all practical purposes, Google and Meta are essentially going to the altar and not just making a short-term deal when it comes to tech allegiances. Another thing to know about this deal is that it is, to some extent, a stopgap solution and part of the greater debate for large companies like Meta about “build vs. buy” — that is, whether it is better to use an outside vendor’s resources or build them internally. That extends to models as well as data centers: as LLMs became more ubiquitous, companies had to decide whether to run their AI applications on someone else’s model (cough cough, OpenAI) or build one themselves. And to be clear, OpenAI does have competitors, but in the grand scheme of things, it doesn’t have that many. In terms of data center planning, Meta already has fairly concrete plans for Prometheus and Hyperion, which are projected to provide 1 gigawatt and 5 gigawatts, respectively, over time. So after that six years, we could see a very different landscape emerging. In offering services in the cloud AI market, Google goes up against a formidable competitor. AWS has been the household brand for cloud practically since the beginning, and by now, the firm has launched AWS Bedrock, where users can actually choose among top models from OpenAI, DeepSeek or others, including Anthropic (AWS was an early backer of Claude). But the new agreement gives Google a boost in AI cloud and reportedly led to a 32% increase in revenue for the company since the deal was announced. Another part of the context is how customers, particularly smaller ones, feel about Google’s cloud services, including the new AI provisioning. Presumably, Meta would not be worried about a rug pull in terms of deprecation, but notes in places like Reddit show that others ponder whether Google Cloud is “going to last” in the competitive environment and, alternately, whether Google will choose to deprecate services. Google’s documentation reveals that Google services are subject to deprecation, so that’s something to keep in mind, but doesn’t necessarily mean that something like that is in the cards or that the company will be “churning” services and rocking smaller customers out of the boat. Regardless of its deal with Meta, Google isn’t just in the business of offering bulk. Its GCP also offers feature services like BigQuery, a serverless data warehouse, and TensorFlow, an open-source ML framework enabling multi-dimensional arrays. There’s a Kubernetes engine, object storage and more, helping the company to rival AWS’ ecosystem approach. Here are some more of Google’s AI offerings: Vertex AI: Google Cloud’s unified platform for building, training, deploying and managing machine learning models with integrated MLOps tools. Generative AI Studio: Vertex AI tool for creating, fine-tuning and deploying generative AI models using prompts and customization. Speech-to-Text / Text-to-Speech: prebuilt AI APIs. Vision AI: cloud-based service that analyzes images and videos, detecting objects, text, faces and visual patterns using machine learning. All of this is going to help the company to remain a powerhouse in AI cloud along with AWS and Microsoft. The deal is notable partly because of its size and partly because it involves not one but two of the companies included in the former acronym FAANG, which represented the five top tech companies in America. That list has shifted a bit, notably, with the emergence of Nvidia as king of the stock market, but Meta and Google are still two titans. Stay tuned for more.

Title: Can AI ‘sorcery’ solve the ‘productivity paradox’ that has gripped the economy for 25 years? A Shakespearean sea change is underfoot

Nick Lichtenberg is Fortune Intelligence editor and was formerly Fortune's executive editor of global news. The late plays by William Shakespeare are alternately called his “romances” or his “problem plays,” because of their ambiguity in tone, as they alternate from passages of magical realism to stark scenes that grapple with complex social issues. At times, they point the way toward the prestige TV of the early 21st century where, for instance, The Sopranos could range from broad comedy to intense violence to avant-garde dream sequences, all in one episode. It’s from the romances that we get phrases that stick with us today, like the description from The Tempest of a “sea change into something rich and strange.” Full disclosure: The author’s brother is an eminent Shakespearean scholar, often quoted in The New York Times, although never previously in Fortune, and so I asked him to explain what this particular term means. “Toward the end of his career,” Drew Lichtenberg of the Shakespeare Theatre Company in Washington DC, said in a statement to Fortune, “Shakespeare started writing genre-defying plays with sudden and miraculous changes of fortune.” Shakespeare used the phrase “sea change” to describe a “magical storm at sea that has the power to snuff out life or restore it in less than a second.” What do Shakespeare’s plays of miraculous changes of fortune have to do with, well, Fortune? Bank of America Institute has projected a “sea change” in the economy. It sees a pivotal transformation in worker productivity at America’s largest companies, driven by lessons from post-pandemic inflation and supercharged by a wave of artificial intelligence and automation. The institute worked hand in hand with projections from Bank of America Research to project a rewiring of the fundamental valuation landscape of the S&P 500, with profound implications for investors and the “quality premium” that U.S. stocks traditionally command. Fortune talked to BofA Research’s Head of US Equity & Quantitative Strategy, Savita Subramanian, to dig into this change, potentially to something rich and strange. It’s not quite that mystical, she said, but she still thinks it’s a big deal. Subramanian explained that what her team has projected isn’t as exciting or dramatic as having actual wizards working at the gears of the economy. The more prosaic insight, she says, is that the combination of AI technology and lessons learned from the inflation wave of the 2020s mean that worker productivity is finally showing signs of increasing. That’s the sea change taking place. At its heart, her work is all about the famous “productivity paradox” identified by Nobel prize-winning economist Robert Solow. “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics,” he said in 1987, long before the productivity crisis of the 21st century set in. As Fortune‘s Jeremy Kahn has discussed, workers still don’t seem to be getting more productive despite the bevy of new technologies at their disposal. In fact, McKinsey’s Chris White and Olivia White argued in 2024 that productivity has been dismal for nearly a generation, hovering around 1% a year, with a dip after the Great Financial Crisis. Subramanian agrees, telling Fortune that if you look at productivity measures, “they haven’t really improved all that much since 2001.” Subramanian wrote on Aug. 8 that the end goal of the massive AI spending that’s rippling through the economy is a “sea-change” in the scale and scope of efficiency gains—and this productivity cycle is already under way. Post-pandemic wage inflation forced companies “to do more with fewer people,” she added, and now AI tools are due to kick that up a notch. But the official stats don’t show a complete understanding of how productivity really functions, Subramanian explained. So BofA took sales, adjusted for inflation, and then divided sales by the number of people working at S&P 500 companies, showing real sales growth versus number of people, what she called a “decent proxy” for productivity, “because if you’re productive, you are doing things more efficiently, you need less labor. And this is more labor efficiency than anything else.” Look at what she found. This means companies are learning to do more with less, and that is kind of magical. Companies have had to do harder work to generate earnings and keep margins healthy, often by replacing their people with processes. “A process is almost free and it’s replicable for eternity,” she said, adding that she thinks this is why the companies exercising efficiency gains have tended to outperform. It’s not only about AI displacing workers, but a fundamental shift in how business is being done. This discussion may seem on its face to be more boring than a tempest and a wizard, she said, but there is something supernatural about the current moment. “I think people love this AI technology because it feels like sorcery,” she said, before adding, “the truth is it hasn’t really changed the world that much yet, but I don’t think it’s something to be dismissed.” Overall, Subramanian finds the S&P 500 has shifted from its 1980s model of asset- and labor-intensive manufacturing to asset- and labor-light innovation, namely tech and health care firms. Showing her work, she calculates that the S&P 500 firms with a focus on innovation, measured through high research and development expenditures, trade at structurally higher multiples of 29x forward earnings per share. More capital-intensive manufacturers, on the other hand, trade at a 21x multiple. The current AI boom is actually a bit risky, she wrote, because the massive data center investments represent a shift from an asset-light to an asset-heavier focus. To be sure, BofA finds that the S&P 500 is now statistically expensive on 19 out of the 20 metrics that they track, including P/E, price to book, price to cash flow, and market cap/GDP. That’s where the sea change matters, because if the shift from manufacturing to innovation is real, then valuations have to shift as well. Hence the “innovation premium” from BofA’s research. Excluding Tesla, Subramanian talks about the other members of the “Magnificent Seven” as evidence of firms losing some of their innovation premium as a result of a shift toward asset-heaviness. As a basket of stocks, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Meta, Nvidia and Apple’s average shareholder yield (i.e., dividends plus net buybacks) has dropped by over 1% since 2015. There are other shifts afoot as well, she told Fortune. “We seem to be at least pausing on this globalization theme,” she said, citing China’s admission to the World Trade Organization in 2001 as a big driver of margin expansion, enabling cost-cutting as a huge lever to keep margins expanding. (It was also the year when worker productivity froze in its tracks.) In the globalization regime, “you didn’t have to think too hard to make money and expand your margins,” she said. It was “very easy and fungible and frictionless” for companies to buy things from different places and contain costs. She also cited the low-interest-rate environment that persisted for much of the past few decades, enabling lots of “financial engineering.” For example, Subramanian said it was common to see companies that knew they would miss their earnings estimates borrowing money and buying back stock to hit their targets, adding the caveat that “there are good reasons to do share buybacks and bad reasons to do share buybacks.” This all “really created a lot of bizarre behavior.” Warren Buffett’s long-time fondness for stock buybacks has even come under fire from other investors, with Jeremy Grantham writing in 2023 that it facilitates stock manipulation and should be illegal. BofA Research found in July 2025, however, that stock buybacks had decelerated a bit, albeit they remained high by historical standards. The situation now is harder in many ways, but companies aren’t able to financially engineer their way to earnings growth, she added. Now that’s a sea change. One final note on the Shakespearean romances, from Drew Lichtenberg: that appellation came about in the late 1700s, nearly two centuries after Shakespeare’s lifetime, with the birth of the romantic movement. The word “romantic” had previously existed, but it didn’t have its current meaning until Samuel Taylor Coleridge elevated it to mean something that connects back directly to nature and the divine genius of humanity’s self-expression. This was largely a response to the Enlightenment’s elevation of reason and logic and its ultimate achievement: the Industrial Revolution that unleashed modern capitalism on the world.
