Shares of the leading designer of high-end AI chips were up 2.2 per cent at $160.6 in morning trading, giving the company a higher market capitalisation than Apple's record closing value of $3.915 trillion on December 26, 2024. Nvidia's newest chips have made gains in training the largest artificial-intelligence models, fuelling demand for products by the Santa Clara, California, company. Microsoft is currently the second-most valuable company on Wall Street, with a market capitalisation of $3.7 trillion as its shares rose 1.5 per cent to $498.5. Apple rose 0.8 per cent, giving it a market value of $3.19 trillion, in third place. Suzuki Is becoming a top japan importer with Made-in-India cars A race among Microsoft, Amazon.com, Meta Platforms , Alphabet and Tesla to build AI data centers and dominate the emerging technology has fueled insatiable demand for Nvidia's high-end processors. "When the first company crossed a trillion dollars, it was amazing. And now you're talking four trillion, which is just incredible. It tells you that there's this huge rush with AI spending and everybody's chasing it right now," said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading. The stock market value of Nvidia, whose core technology was developed to power video games, has increased nearly eight-fold over the past four years, from $500 billion in 2021. Nvidia is now worth more than the combined value of the Canadian and Mexican stock markets, according to LSEG data. The tech company also exceeds the total value of all publicly listed companies in the United Kingdom. Nvidia recently traded at about 32 times analysts' expected earnings for the next 12 months, below its average of about 41 over the past five years, according to LSEG data. That relatively modest price-to-earnings valuation reflects steadily increasing earnings estimates that have outpaced Nvidia's sizable stock gains. The company's stock has now rebounded more than 68 per cent from its recent closing low on April 4, when Wall Street was reeling from President Donald Trump's global tariff announcements. U.S. stocks, including Nvidia, have recovered on expectations that the White House will cement trade deals to soften Trump's tariffs. Nvidia holds a weight of nearly 7.4 per cent on the benchmark S&P 500 . India needs to reverse-engineer imports and invest in deep-tech to reduce dependence on China: GTRI Nvidia's swelling market capitalization underscores Wall Street's big bets on the proliferation of generative AI technology, with the chipmaker's hardware serving as the foundation. Co-founded in 1993 by CEO Jensen Huang, Nvidia has evolved from a niche company popular among video game enthusiasts into Wall Street's barometer for the AI industry. The stock's recent rally comes after a slow first half of the year, when investor optimism about AI took a back seat to worries about tariffs and Trump's trade dispute with Beijing. Chinese startup DeepSeek in January triggered a selloff in global equities markets with a cut-price AI model that outperformed many Western competitors and sparked speculation that companies might spend less on high-end processors. In November of last year, Nvidia took over the spot on the Dow Jones Industrial Average formerly occupied by chipmaker Intel, reflecting a major shift in the semiconductor industry toward AI-linked development and the graphics processing hardware pioneered by Nvidia.

Δ The artificial intelligence chip designer’s market capitalization rose as high as $3.92 trillion, briefly surpassing Apple’s record closing value of $3.915 trillion on Dec. 26, 2024, Reuters reported Thursday. Nvidia’s market cap dipped to $3.89 trillion later Thursday, according to the report. The company still has the largest market value at this time, with Microsoft ranked second at $3.7 trillion and Apple third at $3.19 trillion, the report said. The report attributed Nvidia’s surge to Wall Street’s continued optimism about AI; tech giants’ demand for the company’s products, which they need to build their AI data centers; and Nvidia’s relatively modest price-to-earnings valuation. Nvidia’s market cap has increased nearly eightfold over the past four years, according to the report. The firm’s stock has rebounded from its recently closing low on April 4, which was attributed to the announcements of new tariffs in the United States that were made at that time, per the report. When Nvidia’s market cap hit what was then its all-time high on June 25, Bloomberg reported that the company faces restrictions on selling advanced semiconductors in China but also has big customers like Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet and Amazon that are aggressively building AI infrastructure. During a May 28 earnings call, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said new U.S. export controls have effectively “closed” the $50 billion Chinese market to American companies. Despite that setback, Nvidia is pushing ahead with AI infrastructure projects worldwide to meet demand for AI workloads. The company is doing so because demand for AI inference — the AI workloads in which new data is applied to trained models to generate outputs — is soaring. Other areas of growth include enterprise and industrial AI, and Nvidia has solutions for both, Huang said during the call. When Apple’s market capitalization surged in late December, analysts attributed the rise to the company’s involvement with AI and an expectation that the technology would lead to a wave of consumers deciding to upgrade their phones at once.

Title: Accenture warns AI’s carbon emissions could surge 11-fold. But Big Tech’s still racing to build—and not slow down for sustainability

Sharon Goldman is an AI reporter at Fortune and co-authors Eye on AI, Fortune’s flagship AI newsletter. She has written about digital and enterprise tech for over a decade. Welcome to Eye on AI! In this edition...Ilya Sutskever says he is now CEO of Safe Superintelligence…Chinese AI companies erode U.S. dominance…Meta’s AI talent bidding war heats up…Microsoft’s sales overhaul goes all-in on AI. As an early-summer heat wave blanketed my home state of New Jersey last week, it felt like perfect timing to stumble across a sobering new prediction from Accenture: AI data centers’ carbon emissions are on track to surge 11-fold by 2030. The report estimates that over the next five years, AI data centers could consume 612 terawatt-hours of electricity—roughly equivalent to Canada’s total annual power consumption—driving a 3.4% increase in global carbon emissions. And the strain doesn’t stop at the power grid. At a time when freshwater resources are already under severe pressure, AI data centers are also projected to consume more than 3 billion cubic meters of water per year—a volume that surpasses the annual freshwater withdrawals of entire countries like Norway or Sweden. Unsurprisingly, the report—Powering Sustainable AI—offers recommendations for how to rein in the problem and prevent those numbers from becoming reality. But with near-daily headlines about Big Tech’s massive AI data center buildouts across the U.S. and worldwide, I can’t help but feel cynical. The urgent framing of an AI race against China doesn’t seem to leave much room—or time—for serious thinking about sustainability. Just yesterday, for example, OpenAI agreed to rent a massive amount of computing power from Oracle data centers as part of its Stargate initiative, which intends to invest $500 billion over the next four years building new AI infrastructure for OpenAI in the United States. The additional capacity from Oracle totals about 4.5 gigawatts of data center power in the U.S., according to Bloomberg reporting. A gigawatt is akin to the capacity from one nuclear reactor and can provide electricity to roughly 750,000 houses. And this week, Meta was reported to be seeking to raise $29 billion from private capital firms to build AI data centers in the U.S., while already building a $10 billion AI data center in Northeast Louisiana. As part of that deal, the local utility, Entergy, will supply three new power plants. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has made his intentions clear: The U.S. must rapidly expand AI data center construction or risk falling behind China in the race for AI dominance. Speaking on the Dwarkesh Podcast in May, he warned that America’s edge in artificial intelligence could erode unless it keeps pace with China’s aggressive build-out of data center capacity and factory-scale hardware. “The U.S. really needs to focus on streamlining the ability to build data centers and produce energy,” Zuckerberg said. “Otherwise, we’ll be at a significant disadvantage.” The U.S. government seems to be aligned with that sense of urgency. David Sacks, now serving as the White House AI and Crypto Czar, has also underscored that energy and data center expansion are central to America’s AI strategy—leaving little room for sustainability concerns. On his All In podcast in February, Sacks argued that Washington’s “go-slow” approach to AI could strangle the industry. He emphasized that the U.S. needs to clear the way for infrastructure and energy development—including AI data centers—to keep pace with China. In late May, he went further, saying that streamlining permitting and expanding power generation are essential for AI’s future—something he claimed has been “effectively impossible under the Biden administration.” His message: the U.S. needs to race to build faster. Accenture, meanwhile, is urging its clients to responsibly grow and engineer its AI data centers in a bid to balance growth with environmental responsibility. It is offering a new metric, that it calls the Sustainable AI Quotient (SAIQ), to measure the true costs of AI in terms of money invested, megawatt-hours of energy consumed, tons of CO₂ emitted and cubic meters of water used. The firm’s report says the metric will help organizations answer a basic question: “What are we actually getting from the resources we’re investing in AI?” and allow that enterprise to measure its performance across time. I spoke to Matthew Robinson, managing director of Accenture Research and co-author of the report, who emphasized that he hoped Accenture’s sobering predictions would be proven wrong. “They kind of take your breath away,” he said, explaining that Accenture modeled future energy consumption from the expected number of installed AI chips adjusted for utilization and the additional energy requirements of data centers. That data was combined with regional data on electricity generation, energy mix and emissions, while water use was assessed based on AI data center energy consumption and how much water is consumed per unit of electricity generated. “The point really is to open the conversation around the actions that are available to avert this pathway—we don’t want to be right here,” he said. He would not comment on the actions of specific companies like OpenAI or Meta, but said that overall, clearly more effort is needed to avert the rise in carbonisation fueled by AI data centers while still allowing for growth. Accenture’s recommendations certainly make sense: Optimize the power efficiency of AI workloads and data centers with everything from low-carbon energy options to cooling innovations. Use AI thoughtfully, by choosing smaller AI models, and better pricing models for incentivizing efficiency. And ensure better governance over AI sustainability initiatives. It’s hard to imagine that the biggest players in the race for AI dominance—Big Tech giants and heavily funded startups—will hit the brakes long enough to seriously address these growing concerns. Not that it’s impossible. Take Google, for example: In its latest sustainability report released this week, the company revealed that its data centers are consuming more power than ever. In 2024, Google used approximately 32.1 million megawatt-hours (MWh) of electricity, with a staggering 95.8%—about 30.8 million MWh—consumed by its data centers. That’s more than double the energy its data centers used in 2020, just before the consumer AI boom. Still, Google emphasized that it’s making meaningful strides toward cleaning up its energy supply, even as demand surges. The company said it cut its data center energy emissions by 12% in 2024, thanks to clean energy projects and efficiency upgrades. And it’s squeezing more out of every watt. Google reported that the amount of compute per unit of electricity has increased about six-fold over the past five years. Its power usage effectiveness (PUE)—a key measure of data center efficiency—is now approaching the theoretical minimum of 1.0, with a reported PUE of 1.09 in 2024. “Just speaking personally, I’d be optimistic,” said Robinson. Note: Check out this new Fortune video about my tour of IBM’s quantum computing test lab. I had a fabulous time hanging out at IBM’s Yorktown Heights campus (a midcentury modern marvel designed by the same guy as the St. Louis Arch and the classic TWA Flight Center at JFK Airport) in New York. The video was part of my coverage for this year’s Fortune 500 issue that included an article that dug deep into IBM’s recent rebound. As I said in my piece, “walking through the IBM research center is like stepping into two worlds at once. There are the steel and glass curves of Saarinen’s design, punctuated by massive walls made of stones collected from the surrounding fields, with original Eames chairs dotting discussion nooks. But this 20th-century modernism contrasts starkly with the sleek, massive, refrigerator-like quantum computer—among the most advanced in the world—that anchors the collaboration area and working lab, where it whooshes with the steady hum of its cooling system.” With that, here’s the rest of the AI news. Sharon Goldmansharon.goldman@fortune.com@sharongoldman Ilya Sutskever says he is now CEO of Safe Superintelligence, after Daniel Gross steps down to join Meta. Ilya Sutskever, the former OpenAI chief scientist who founded Safe Superintelligence (SSI) with Daniel Gross and Daniel Levy a year ago, confirmed that he will now serve as SSI’s CEO after Daniel Gross stepped down. Sustkever posted on X saying: “Daniel Gross’s time with us has been winding down, and as of June 29 he is officially no longer a part of SSI. We are grateful for his early contributions to the company and wish him well in his next endeavor. I am now formally CEO of SSI, and Daniel Levy is President. The technical team continues to report to me. ⁠You might have heard rumors of companies looking to acquire us. We are flattered by their attention but are focused on seeing our work through.” Meta was rumored to have sought to acquire the $32 billion-valued SSI. Chinese AI companies erode U.S. dominance. According to the Wall Street Journal, Chinese artificial intelligence companies are gaining ground globally, challenging U.S. supremacy and intensifying a potential AI arms race. Across Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia, organizations—from multinational banks like HSBC and Standard Chartered to Saudi Aramco—are increasingly adopting large language models from Chinese firms such as DeepSeek and Alibaba as alternatives to U.S. offerings like ChatGPT. Even American cloud giants like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, and Google now offer access to DeepSeek’s models, despite U.S. government security restrictions on the company’s apps. While OpenAI’s ChatGPT still leads in global adoption—with 910 million downloads versus DeepSeek’s 125 million—Chinese models are undercutting U.S. competition by offering nearly comparable performance at much lower prices. Meta’s AI talent bidding war heats up. As Mark Zuckerberg rapidly staffs up Meta’s new superintelligence lab, his company has reportedly offered some OpenAI researchers eye-popping pay packages of up to $300 million over four years, with more than $100 million in first-year compensation, Wired reports. The offers, which include immediate stock vesting, have been extended to at least 10 OpenAI employees, according to sources familiar with the negotiations. While Meta’s aggressive recruiting tactics have caught the attention of top talent, some OpenAI staffers told Wired they’re weighing the massive payouts against their potential impact at Meta versus staying at OpenAI. A Meta spokesperson pushed back, claiming reports of the offer sizes are exaggerated. Still, even Meta’s senior engineers typically make around $850,000 per year, with those in higher pay bands earning over $1.5 million annually, according to Levels.FYI data. Microsoft’s sales overhaul goes all-in on AI. Microsoft’s sales chief, Judson Althoff, is reshaping the company’s sales organization to double down on AI, according to an internal memo obtained by Business Insider. Althoff’s Microsoft Customer and Partner Solutions (MCAPS) unit will now focus on embedding Copilot across devices and roles, deepening Microsoft 365 and Dynamics 365 adoption, winning high-impact AI deals, expanding Azure cloud migration, and strengthening cybersecurity to support AI growth. The memo, sent just one day before Microsoft’s latest round of layoffs—many of which affected Althoff’s sales teams—outlined his vision to make Microsoft “the Frontier AI Firm.” According to Business Insider, this restructuring follows Althoff’s earlier plan to cut the number of sales solution areas in half starting this fiscal year.

That’s how much U.S. investment in AI companies soared to in the first quarter of this year—a 33% jump from the previous quarter and a staggering 550% increase compared to the quarter before ChatGPT’s 2022 debut, according to PitchBook. The biggest price tag? Data centers. The New York Times reports that Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Google plan to spend a combined $320 billion on infrastructure this year—more than double what they spent just two years ago. A huge chunk of that will go toward building new data centers to keep up with the exploding demand for AI. © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Nvidia was on track to become the most valuable company in history today, with the chipmaker's market capitalisation reaching $3.92 trillion as Wall Street doubled down on optimism about AI. Shares of the leading designer of high-end AI chips were up 2.2% at $160.6 in morning trading, giving the company a higher market capitalisation than Apple's record closing value of $3.915 trillion on December 26, 2024.

Loading Apple rose 0.8 per cent, giving it a market value of US$3.19 trillion, in third place. A race among Microsoft, Amazon.com, Meta Platforms, Alphabet and Tesla to build AI data centres and dominate the emerging technology has fueled insatiable demand for Nvidia's high-end processors. "When the first company crossed a trillion dollars, it was amazing. And now you're talking four trillion, which is just incredible. It tells you that there's this huge rush with AI spending and everybody's chasing it right now," said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading.

It tells you that there's this huge rush with AI spending and everybody's chasing it right now," said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading. The stock market value of Nvidia, whose core technology was developed to power video games, has increased nearly eightfold over the past four years, from US$500 billion in 2021. Nvidia is now worth more than the combined value of the Canadian and Mexican stock markets, according to LSEG data. The tech company also exceeds the total value of all publicly listed companies in the United Kingdom. Nvidia recently traded at about 32 times analysts' expected earnings for the next 12 months, below its average of about 41 over the past five years, according to LSEG data. That relatively modest price-to-earnings valuation reflects steadily increasing earnings estimates that have outpaced Nvidia's sizable stock gains. The company's stock has now rebounded more than 68 per cent from its recent closing low on Apr 4, when Wall Street was reeling from President Donald Trump's global tariff announcements. US stocks, including Nvidia, have recovered on expectations that the White House will cement trade deals to soften Trump's tariffs. Nvidia holds a weight of nearly 7.4 per cent on the benchmark S&P 500. Nvidia's swelling market capitalisation underscores Wall Street's big bets on the proliferation of generative AI technology, with the chipmaker's hardware serving as the foundation. Co-founded in 1993 by CEO Jensen Huang, Nvidia has evolved from a niche company popular among video game enthusiasts into Wall Street's barometer for the AI industry. The stock's recent rally comes after a slow first half of the year, when investor optimism about AI took a back seat to worries about tariffs and Trump's trade dispute with Beijing. Chinese startup DeepSeek in January triggered a selloff in global equities markets with a cut-price AI model that outperformed many Western competitors and sparked speculation that companies might spend less on high-end processors. In November of last year, Nvidia took over the spot on the Dow Jones Industrial Average formerly occupied by chipmaker Intel, reflecting a major shift in the semiconductor industry toward AI-linked development and the graphics processing hardware pioneered by Nvidia.

Title: Apple’s Big AI Bet: Could Perplexity Be A Game Changer?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/roomykhan/2025/07/03/apples-big-ai-bet-could-perplexity-be-a-game-changer/

ByRoomy Khan ByRoomy Khan, Contributor. Apple and Artificial Intelligence Apple’s stock is down nearly 20% so far in 2025, making it the only Magnificent Seven member in the red. Acquiring Perplexity AI, a leading AI search engine, could immediately boost investor confidence and give Apple a chance to seize AI leadership. The stakes are clear: On June 28, 2025, Bloomberg revealed that Apple's M&A chief, Adrian Perica, had discussed acquiring Perplexity with services head Eddy Cue. Analysts estimate such a deal could cost between $25 and $30 billion, roughly twice Perplexity's last funding round valuation, and consistent with recent acquisition premiums paid for strategic AI properties. Days later, reports emerged that Apple is also weighing partnerships with Anthropic's Claude and OpenAI's ChatGPT to power a new Siri. Apple is racing to close its AI gap through whatever means necessary. Industry experts and Wall Street analysts believe a Perplexity deal could recast Apple as an AI orchestration leader, extend its high-margin services through renewed hardware demand, and potentially trigger a valuation rerating. Disclaimer: This article is based solely on publicly available information, market reports, and the author's independent research and analysis. The author has no insider contacts at Apple, Perplexity, Anthropic, OpenAI, Microsoft, Google, Meta, Amazon, Samsung, or any other company mentioned, and no direct knowledge of their internal strategies, acquisition decisions, or future plans. All strategic interpretations are speculative and intended for informational purposes only. Apple is reportedly considering acquiring Perplexity AI not just to buy another chatbot, but to build what could become the world’s first consumer AI orchestration platform. Instead of forcing users to choose between ChatGPT, Claude, or Google Search, its system would automatically call upon the best model for each task. This embodies Apple's 'it just works' philosophy, delivering seamless, intelligent experiences that are intuitive, invisible, and effortlessly powerful. This isn’t just about catching up in AI. It’s about redefining how humans interact with it. Using intent recognition (understanding what the user wants—like checking the weather vs drafting an email) and query analysis (figuring out the best way to answer—like searching real-time data vs explaining a concept), the system routes requests in milliseconds. Here's how it could work: For example, ask, 'Should I invest in Apple stock?' Perplexity pulls the latest market data and analyst commentary, with citations. ChatGPT explains investing principles and risk factors in conversational language. Apple Intelligence then combines everything into one smart, personalized response. Whether you're asking Siri a question, pointing your camera at a landmark, or drafting an email, each AI model contributes its unique strength, fused into one unified experience. Daily examples of this ambient intelligence include: "What's the weather?" → Apple Intelligence delivers local results on-device; "Cancel my meeting politely." → ChatGPT drafts the diplomatic email; "Any new research on quantum computing?" → Perplexity surfaces the latest studies; "Set a timer for 10 minutes." → Apple Intelligence handles it privately, on-device. Personal data remains protected on-device, with only anonymized queries sent to external services when necessary. Users retain override control, but most interactions become ambient and invisible. If Apple pursues an orchestration strategy, it would likely rely on each AI partner playing a specialized role. ChatGPT excels at conversation, Claude at reasoning, and Perplexity at real-time, citation-backed search. Unlike general LLMs, Perplexity is an AI-native search engine specialized for real-time, citation-backed answers atop these models. Think of Perplexity as Google Search reimagined for the AI era. Instead of giving you a list of blue links to sift through, it delivers direct, citation-backed answers in clear, conversational language, summarizing multiple sources so you can decide intelligently what to explore further. It also provides cues on related topics worth investigating. For example, when you ask “Should I buy Coinbase stock?”, Perplexity doesn’t just list articles. It offers a structured, conversational analysis including current price, valuation ratios, Morningstar fair value, fundamental risks, technical ratings, and professional opinions—all in one place—followed by suggested related questions like options strategies, historical comparisons, and upcoming catalysts. The acquisition logic becomes clear when comparing alternatives. ChatGPT's $300 billion valuation makes acquisition prohibitive, while partnerships suffice for conversational needs. Claude, valued at $61.5 billion, could cost $80–90 billion with market premiums, unjustifiable when licensing suffices. At a $14 billion last funding round valuation, Perplexity is the attainable target, with specialized search capabilities and an orchestration-ready architecture that appears well-suited to Apple’s potential orchestration approach. Apple and Perplexity Currently, Perplexity generates just under $100 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR), doubling from ~$50 million in late 2024—a fraction of its potential under Apple’s vast distribution and financial moat. With more than 2.2 billion active devices, a premium user base, and seamless payment infrastructure, its revenue baseline could expand dramatically. Even at a 30% conversion rate among more than 2.2 billion devices, priced at $15 to $20 per month, consumer revenue alone could reach $2.4 to $3.2 billion annually. Enterprise markets offer additional upside, as AI tools command premium pricing: Microsoft Copilot starts at $30 per user monthly, Lexis+ runs around $300–400 per attorney per month, Westlaw starts near $133 and rises for advanced tiers, and Bloomberg Law costs roughly $6,000 per lawyer annually. Law firms spend up to $21,000 per attorney on specialized research tools, while major universities allocate up to $12.5 million annually to digital resources. Pre-installed across Apple’s ecosystem, Perplexity would gain instant reach unmatched by competitors, transforming it from a standalone service into a defensible, multibillion-dollar AI search powerhouse. Combined consumer and enterprise potential creates a clear path to recovering the estimated $30 billion acquisition cost within a decade or sooner, and could catapult Apple onto offense rather than leaving it on the defensive. Apple's current partnership with ChatGPT illustrates the limitations of relying on external AI providers. Each query requires user permission, incurs per-request costs, and faces security restrictions and delays due to routing through external providers. More importantly, these models cannot fully leverage Apple's Neural Engine architecture to deliver optimal performance. The Microsoft–OpenAI relationship offers a cautionary parallel. Despite Microsoft’s $13 billion investment, strategic tensions have emerged as it now competes directly with OpenAI in search, coding, and enterprise AI services. OpenAI has even considered filing antitrust complaints against Microsoft, and ongoing governance disputes continue to hinder both companies' strategic goals. Acquiring Perplexity AI could avoid these partnership pitfalls while delivering four key advantages. Seamless integration could eliminate permission prompts for factual queries, remove external API dependencies, and reduce latency through direct local processing. Hardware optimization could allow Perplexity's search models to run natively on Apple's M4 Neural Engine, minimizing network delays while maintaining privacy through unified memory architecture. The deal could also provide immediate talent acquisition—Apple would instantly gain proven AI experts who've already built a successful search-AI hybrid at scale. This specialized expertise could become crucial as Siri improvements remain delayed until at least 2026. Moreover, top talent attracts top talent: having Perplexity's team in-house could significantly enhance Apple's ability to recruit other leading AI researchers. Finally, cost efficiency could emerge from owning the highest-volume use case—factual queries—allowing Apple to avoid per-API-call expenses while continuing to license specialized conversational models only where necessary. This orchestration approach creates multiple competitive advantages: For users: No more wondering which AI tool to download or try, or AI app hopping. Just ask and get the best answer from whichever AI knows best. For Apple: It could deliver the unified experiences users expect from Apple and create true platform differentiation. While Android users juggle separate apps, iPhone users could get everything integrated intelligently. For competitors: In the face of Apple’s seamless AI orchestration, their offerings may quickly feel outdated and like disjointed point solutions. Microsoft’s Copilot could seem bolted-on, Google’s AI Overviews might remain limited to a single Gemini-driven perspective, and Meta could continue focusing mainly on social features. Just as the iPhone transformed how we used phones, Apple’s orchestration could transform how we use AI. On the other hand, if rivals like Google, Microsoft, or Amazon were to acquire Perplexity instead, they could embed it deeply at the OS level, leaving Apple to continue developing such solutions in-house, where it has seen only limited success so far. Acquiring Perplexity could put Apple on a fast track to deliver the premium “wow” experiences it is known for, securing advantages that could be extremely costly for competitors to counter. Samsung's reported partnership discussions with Perplexity this year add immediate pressure. Preferential Android access could not only weaken Apple's differentiation but also drive Perplexity's acquisition cost even higher. While Apple is late to AI, monetization remains largely unproven across the industry, giving it a rare chance to leapfrog competitors by executing orchestration better than anyone else. The challenges are significant. Bringing together multiple AI systems at Apple's scale will be an enormous engineering lift. Orchestrating requests in milliseconds without glitches demands flawless backend architecture. Apple's brand is built on privacy: even anonymized external queries could trigger user concerns if transparency isn't crystal clear. With Siri upgrades delayed to 2026, a 12 to 18-month Perplexity integration risks missing the AI wave entirely if rivals move faster. The estimated $30 billion price tag could rise further if other bidders enter the fray. These risks are real, but with AI becoming the next battleground, Apple may have no choice but to tackle them head-on if it wants to become a leader. The stakes are high. This move could trigger a valuation rerating and preserve Apple’s leadership in the next tech battleground. However, delay or indecision risks ceding ground to rivals and forfeiting a valuable strategic edge. This orchestration bet could redefine human-AI interaction, but only if Apple acts decisively before the window closes.

Title: Korean Internet Giant Kakao Teams With Open AI To Jumpstart Growth

ByJohn Kang ByJohn Kang, Forbes Staff. Shina Chung and Sam Altman are hoping for a win-win. Striding purposefully across the stage at a packed media briefing held in Seoul in early February, Shina Chung, CEO of Korean internet giant Kakao, leaned in to greet OpenAI cofounder Sam Altman. After six months of negotiations, the two companies had just sealed a partnership that would give Kakao (market cap: $20 billion) access to the American AI titan’s powerful technology. As Chung declared on stage, it could potentially turn “all imaginable AI-era services into reality”—and give Kakao a fighting chance to leapfrog the competition. With OpenAI’s help, Kakao hopes to realize its ambitions of being at the forefront of providing hyper-personalized services to the 49 million users of its ubiquitous superapp KakaoTalk, which equals about 94% of the country’s population. Chung is targeting a November rollout of so-called AI agents—next generation virtual assistants that can go beyond answering basic questions to making decisions and even taking actions on behalf of users. Shina Chung, CEO of Kakao “We needed a partner we could trust, especially one who leads the field in performance and innovation,” says Chung in an exclusive interview with Forbes Asia at Kakao’s office in Pangyo, South Korea’s Silicon Valley, just south of Seoul. “We had the same philosophy.” For Kakao and its first woman CEO, the OpenAI alliance could be nothing less than a game-changer. Since taking the top job in March 2024, Chung’s biggest challenge is to steer the company through the longest stretch of sluggish sales in its 15-year history. The 50-year-old Chung, who featured on Forbes Asia’s Power Businesswomen list last year, is betting that going all-in on AI will be a catalyst for growth. “We are now preparing to significantly change KakaoTalk so that AI can penetrate its many services,” she says. The collaboration isn’t a one-way deal. For OpenAI, it offers an opportunity to further its global ambitions by providing access to one of the world’s most tech-savvy markets, which has the highest number of paying subscribers outside the U.S. for ChatGPT, its revolutionary chatbot. “We’re excited to bring advanced AI to Kakao’s millions of users and work together to integrate our technology into services that transform how Kakao’s users communicate and connect,” says OpenAI’s chief product officer Kevin Weil by email. Just the day before the glad-handing event with Chung, Altman was in Tokyo with SoftBank’s billionaire founder Masayoshi Son, announcing a new joint venture to market AI services to Japanese companies. SoftBank recently led a $40 billion funding round in OpenAI and the two companies are also partners in the $500 billion Stargate project to build AI data centers in the U.S. Jaehyun Kim For Forbes ASIA It’s a critical turning point for Kakao. The company’s business is dependent on the Korean market—compared with blue-chip stalwarts like Samsung and Hyundai whose fortunes are determined by global exports—which faces a deepening economic slump. The country’s GDP contracted by 0.2% in the first quarter amid the threat of a global trade war, weak consumer spending and months of political turmoil. In 2024 the company narrowed its net loss to 161.9 billion won ($119.4 million) from 1.82 trillion won the previous year, on a 4% uptick in revenue to 7.87 trillion won. The alliance with OpenAI could yield as much as double-digit sales growth within two years, according to Kakao as it transforms itself into a company where AI is at the core of its operations and services. Percentages have been rounded. Chung will need to act fast to hard-bake the fast-evolving tech into Kakao’s businesses, which run the gamut of everyday activities, from messaging and online banking to music streaming and taxi-hailing, to gain an edge on its chief rival Naver, South Korea’s biggest internet company by revenue (2024: 10.73 trillion won). The Seongnam-based firm is widely seen as being a step ahead of Kakao in the AI race with its large language model (LLM) HyperClova X, launched in 2023 and tailored for the Korean language and culture. Also closing in is a fast-growing crop of local AI native startups. “The AI agent will automatically do the work for you and life will be so much better even without knowing what AI is.” Already Chung has begun laying the foundation. In mid-June, the company announced a 600-billion-won investment to build a 92,000-square-meter AI data center in Namyangju city, about 25 kilometers from Seoul. The data center—its second after last year’s launch of a facility in Ansan with 6 billion gigabytes of data storage capacity—will break ground in 2026 and is slated to open by 2029. By leveraging OpenAI’s LLMs, which undergird ChatGPT, Kakao is developing a suite of services with the aim of getting users to increase their time on the superapp—and spend more money while using it. “We saw diminishing returns trying to compete in the benchmark tests for the most powerful AI models, so we decided on a more practical approach seeking cost efficiency,” says Chung. OpenAI-powered AI agents have the potential to autonomously plan and take action across Kakao’s digital ecosystem, with limited human direction; for example, make a restaurant booking on behalf of a KakaoTalk user, add a calendar reminder, book a taxi and pay for a meal. That stickiness, Chung believes, will result in more ads—one of Kakao’s main revenue drivers—reaching users across its chats and channels. “AI enhances our core business, especially advertising and commerce,” she says. Advertising accounted for 15% of group revenue last year while its commerce unit contributed 11%. Kakao earns commissions of up to 8% per transaction for gifts sent between KakaoTalk users. An average of 600,000 gifts (from chocolate to vitamins to cosmetics and clothes) are exchanged daily, the company says, in the form of mobile vouchers that can be redeemed at participating restaurants and retailers or ordered from the platform’s gift shop. “The advertising business, which currently operates as the main cash cow of internet companies, will undergo dynamic changes with the introduction of AI-based services,” says Jingu Kim, a Seoul-based analyst at Kiwoom Securities. He predicts there will be a rapid uptake in B2C-based subscription plans that include AI agent services. “In this process, we expect that Kakao will be able to secure sustainable growth and level up its corporate value through its collaboration with OpenAI.” A Kakao Friends store selling character merchandise such as Ryan (the lion) and the radish-in-rabbit clothing Muzi. In a dry run with OpenAI’s tech in early May, Kakao launched a new standalone messaging app called Kanana for closed beta testing that features AI agents Kana and Nana. Powered by OpenAI’s GPT and its own small language model (SLM), it can assist users in personal and group chats by answering questions, summarizing group conversations, setting meeting times for events and sharing updates. Kakao declined to say how much it has spent but discloses that some 400 employees, or about 10% of its workforce, are working on AI projects. “For everyday-use cases, we don’t need to [invest in] a large language model,” says Chung, as that can cost hundreds of millions of dollars and take years to develop. Besides being cheaper to train and run, SLMs are safer to use as they’re less likely to provide incorrect answers to user queries, known as hallucinations, while also being more secure, she adds. It doesn’t require a network connection to a cloud, which is vulnerable to server breaches. Kakao will use its SLM to perform simple tasks, while relying on OpenAI’s powerful LLM to manage more complex, multistep and linked applications across Kakao’s ecosystem, says Chung. It’s the same strategy used by Apple: simple queries are answered by Siri, powered by Apple’s in-house Apple Intelligence LLM, and more complex questions are directed to ChatGPT. “Everyone was defaulting to GPUs for AI, but does it make sense to use the most expensive chips for small inference tasks?” explains Chung. A taxi operated by Korea Mobility. The company expects to complete Kanana’s closed beta testing in November, around the same time that it plans to launch the OpenAI-Kakao AI agent. “The virtual assistant will automatically do the work for you and life will be so much better even without knowing what AI is,” says Chung. “Because now you need to find which app to use, go to the app, take action. With agentic AI it will be seamless.” Alongside her tech focus, Chung has been striving to make Kakao leaner. This has involved shedding non-core businesses—the number of affiliates has dropped by a fifth over the past two years to 115 from 147, the company says. Then there’s the planned spin-off of Daum, the country’s second-largest portal site by daily visitors, which Kakao acquired in 2014. This will allow Chung to concentrate on juicing up other parts of Kakao’s portfolio, both domestic and overseas, and in particular its banking, entertainment and digital healthcare services. In June, a joint venture between its internet banking arm Kakao Bank and Thai financial group SCBX, which controls Siam Commercial Bank, received approval from the Thai government to establish a virtual bank in Thailand, making it the first Korean bank to operate in the country in 25 years. Earlier this year Kakao Entertainment announced the global launch of its fan-community app Berriz as Kakao Healthcare forged a partnership with Seoul-based elderly-care startup Caring and expanded into Japan. Source: Kakao Kakao’s sales started to lose steam after peaking at 2 trillion won in the third quarter of 2023. With the company being under pressure to boost revenue and earnings, founder Kim Beom-su embarked on an aggressive expansion of its entertainment portfolio. Kim, who has a 24% stake in Kakao and a net worth of $5.1 billion, made the fate­ful call to get into a bidding war for K-pop agency SM Entertainment with Korean billionaire Bang Si-hyuk’s Hybe, manager of boy band sensation BTS. While Kakao was ultimately successful, snatching a 35% stake in SM for 1.3 trillion won in March 2023, prosecutors alleged that Kim, long-hailed as an internet pioneer, had manipulated SM’s stock price to ward off Hybe. Kim, who denied any wrongdoing, was arrested in July 2024 and is currently out on bail awaiting trial. In a statement to Kakao employees at the time, he said: “The allegations are not true. I have never instructed or condoned any illegal acts.” A crisis “can be an opportunity for renewal.” During the takeover battle for SM, Chung was running venture capital arm Kakao Ventures and also had a board seat at Kakao. She had made a name for herself as a VC investor with a portfolio that produced four unicorns. To steady the ship, Kakao’s board enlisted Chung as CEO last year. “I saw that period as a turning point for Kakao,” she recalls, adding that a crisis “can be an opportunity for renewal.” Chung’s forward-looking approach was honed over a 25-year career that has included roles at Boston Consulting Group, eBay and Kakao rival Naver. Chung studied French literature at Yonsei University in Seoul (not because she particularly liked French lit, she says, but because back then it was the subject du jour among brainy female students), followed by a master’s degree in marketing from the same college and an M.B.A. from the University of Michigan. Photo by Jaehyun Kim for Forbes Asia In 2014, she joined Kakao Ventures as a partner, becoming its CEO four years later. Her decade-long stint at the VC arm taught her how to deploy “my imagination with curiosity,” she says. “For example, the market for most early-stage investments wasn’t there yet, so I needed to imagine it.” She did just that with Kakao Ventures’ early backing of South Korean AI chipmaker Rebellions, contributing 2 billion won of the 5.5 billion won in seed funding in 2020. Last December, Rebellions became the country’s first AI chip unicorn, valued at 1.3 trillion won, equivalent to $1 billion at the time, after it merged with a rival chipmaker owned by Korean billionaire Chey Tae-won’s SK Group (Kakao retains a stake). It’s not a given that Chung’s big tech bet will pay off. There are concerns in the industry that AI agents are more hype than substance, and could struggle to gain traction with users, much like Facebook’s metaverse, which saw the social media giant rebrand itself Meta and pour tens of billions of dollars into a virtual world project that has so far flopped. Alongside OpenAI, tech firms Google, Anthropic and Salesforce have debuted AI agents for consumers and businesses but they are nowhere near mainstream. OpenAI is also restricted in its use of personal data collected from Kanana agents, per a government review requested by Kakao over concerns about sharing personal information such as bank account and credit card details. Chat data must be stored in a database controlled by Kakao and can’t be used by OpenAI for commercial purposes, the Personal Information Protection Commission ruled. Kakao Pay is accepted at stores throughout South Korea. For now, a campaign promise by South Korea’s new president Lee Jae-myung to invest 100 trillion won in AI and introduce measures to support the country’s internet giants has led Kakao’s previously moribund shares to surge over 85% in the past two months. Investors also piled in over a proposed law that would allow companies in South Korea to issue won stablecoins, with Kakao’s listed payments platform Kakao Pay seen as one of the main beneficiaries. Kakao Pay shares rocketed before correcting sharply recently after regulators highlighted the risks associated with stablecoins. Chung’s shown the stamina and smarts to meet such challenges and has a secret weapon up her sleeve: imagination. “It will work very well,” she says. “Especially when new eras come.”

Title: Beyond Nvidia: 5 Lesser-Known AI Stocks Poised For Growth To Buy Now

ByPeter Cohan ByPeter Cohan, Senior Contributor. Nvidia is not the sole beneficiary of the generative AI boom. Nvidia is the best-known company capitalizing on the generative AI boom that began in 2023, when ChatGPT quickly scaled to over 100 million users. In fact, it was Nvidia’s first-quarter 2023 report, which featured a decline in revenue and forecast huge growth, that made me realize a new technology wave was building akin to the internet boom of the 1990s. Nvidia’s prospects gave me the kick to write a book, Brain Rush, published last year. Since then I have continued to track publicly-traded companies that benefit from growth in demand for generative AI. In my book I mapped out the generative AI value network, including AI chip producers, data center technology makers, cloud services providers, large language model builders, generative AI application developers and AI business consultants. From this network, I created an index of publicly-traded companies in the generative AI ecosystem. Based on the performance of this index, I have identified five lesser-known AI stocks poised for growth. CoreWeave is a New Jersey-based provider of cloud computing services for AI developers and enterprises. Its stock market value has soared 308% since it went public in March. CoreWeave’s stock rise can be attributed to the company’s torrid revenue growth – up 420% in the quarter ending in March, according to a CoreWeave investor letter. Retail investor interest in the company and partnerships with leading AI companies have also contributed to the stock’s performance. Specifically, CoreWeave partners with Nvidia, which Fortune reported invested in CoreWeave before it went public, as well as OpenAI, which makes ChatGPT. CoreWeave is on my list because its exceptional growth exceeded my expectations and its stock-price increase leads the pack of Nvidia peers. Prior to the company’s initial public offering, I highlighted key risks – CoreWeave’s dependence on a few large customers, the company’s heavy debt load and the CEO’s lack of experience running a public company. But if the company can keep exceeding high growth expectations, its shares could rise more. Denver-based Palantir Technologies provides software to help public and private-sector clients identify trends, detect fraud and optimize operations through big data analytics. It has enjoyed an 81.3% increase in its stock price in the first half of this year. Palantir achieved rapid growth and high profitability. For example, the company’s revenue increased 39.3% in the first quarter while generating an impressive 24.2% net profit margin, according to a Palantir investor letter. Why is Palantir on a list of AI stocks? Palantir is one of the few companies that have been able to generate substantial revenue growth from the application of generative AI, as I wrote in February. Indeed with the exception of Nvidia, no other company has achieved such significant growth from generative AI-powered products. What’s more, Palantir recently raised its revenue growth forecast for the year from 31% to 36%. In addition to benefiting from government contracts provided by the Trump administration, Palantir stock could be propelled by potential contracts for projects such as the Golden Dome – a U.S. missile shield akin to Israel’s Iron Dome. Citi Research analyst Tyler Radke is not all smiles. Investor's Business Daily reported recently that after meeting with Palantir management, Radke wrote, "We continue to have concerns on how Palantir stock can grow into its valuation, especially if magnitude of positive revisions slow or large contracts (Golden Dome) don't materialize as expected." Snowflake, a Bozeman, Montana-based provider of data analysis services, has enjoyed a 42.1% increase in its share price during the first half of the year. While Snowflake is unprofitable, the company’s revenue grew nearly 26% in the quarter ending in April, CNBC reported. Behind the increase in Snowflake’s stock price are successful initiatives to integrate generative AI into the company’s products, as well as partnerships with OpenAI and Anthropic, according to CNBC. In addition, Snowflake exceeded investor expectations and raised its growth guidance. Snowflake is growing thanks to its new CEO, Sridhar Ramaswamy, whom I interviewed in May 2024. When Ramaswamy took over as chief executive in February 2024, I was unsure whether he would be as successful as his predecessor, Frank Slootman, who handed over the top job because his successor had a deeper understanding of AI. Since then, Ramaswamy has given Snowflake’s generative AI strategy new life. Indeed, I am including Snowflake on my list because a Snowflake manager told me at a conference in San Francisco in May 2025 that Ramaswamy is doing an excellent job of leading the company’s AI product development. Shares of Meta Platforms, the social media parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, rose 23% in the first half of the year. In the first quarter of 2025, Meta reported 16.1% revenue growth and earned a whopping 39.3% net profit margin, according to Meta’s investor letter. The company has distinguished itself from rivals by using AI to help digital ad buyers sell more. In addition, Meta’s investments in AI-powered products such as Meta AI could become a new growth curve, as I wrote last October. Meta is on my list because the company is betting heavily on AI. Its new “Superintelligence Labs” unit, led by former Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman, could create new growth curves for the company, Barron’s reported. However, a note of skepticism is called for because Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has bet big in the past – remember the metaverse, which drove the company’s name change from Facebook? That bet has produced billions of dollars worth of losses and does not appear poised to pay off. Nevertheless, Meta could surprise me if the company can attract and motivate the talent needed to surpass more focused rivals like OpenAI and Perplexity. Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor, which makes the chips Nvidia and others design, have risen 12.3%, increasing steeply, since late April. TSMC grew revenue 41.6% in the first quarter and earned a 43% net profit margin, according to the company’s investor letter. While tariff uncertainty and geopolitical instability could threaten TSMC, a long-standing partnership with Nvidia could propel TSMC stock higher. Analysts project growth in TSMC’s AI-related revenue as high as 45% compounded annually through 2030, according to AInvest. If this prediction is realized, investors could benefit from owning TSMC stock. Bottom Line Nvidia is not the sole beneficiary of the generative AI boom. Other companies who play in the AI ecosystem – CoreWeave, Palantir, Snowflake, Meta Platforms and TSMC – may also enjoy big increases in their stock prices. Investors should consider whether to add them to their portfolios.

Title: Chinese tech firms gaining fast on Silicon Valley in AI race: report

China is fast encroaching on the US’ lead in the artificial intelligence race – raising concerns that Beijing could use the tech for strategic military advancements and the spread of disinformation, according to a report. Multinational banks, public universities and tech firms across Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia have started to pivot to language learning models from Chinese firms like DeepSeek, according to a Wall Street Journal report. DeepSeek’s bot triggered a massive stock sell-off in the US earlier this year amid claims that it took less time and a fraction of the cost to develop compared to American counterparts. Global banking giants HSBC and Standard Chartered have launched internal testing of the Chinese model, while Saudi Aramco, the world’s largest oil company, recently installed the bot in its main data center, according to the Journal. American tech giants like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft and Google offer DeepSeek to customers – even as the Trump administration has banned the use of the Chinese model on government devices. OpenAI’s ChatGPT is still the world’s most popular AI chatbot, with 910 million downloads worldwide compared to DeepSeek’s 125 million, according to researcher Sensor Tower. But Chinese bots are winning over users with much lower prices. And while US firms tend to focus on headline-worthy breakthroughs, China’s models are more consumer-friendly, according to the Journal. “The No. 1 factor that will define whether the U.S. or China wins this race is whose technology is most broadly adopted in the rest of the world,” Microsoft President Brad Smith said during a Senate hearing last month. “Whoever gets there first will be difficult to supplant,” Smith warned. China is already exploring how it could exploit advances in AI for strategic military advances, according to papers published in military journals. If Beijing wins over the majority of users, its bots would serve as a powerful megaphone to cast out information reflecting its own view of the world. And, if China at some point stops cooperating with the US on safety and security measures, its unrestricted artificial intelligence could lead to unprecedented military and societal threats. Chinese firms have already succeeded despite several hurdles, including a harsh clampdown on US chip exports. Those trade roadblocks could also hurt American tech giants like Google, Meta and Nvidia, the latter of which is estimated to lose out on $10 billion in revenue without sales of its H20 AI chip to Beijing, according to researcher Jefferies. It’s a substantial change from just a few years back, when US investors in 2018 covered about 30% of $21.9 billion in funding for the Chinese AI sector, according to PitchBook. Every morning, the NY POSTcast offers a deep dive into the headlines with the Post’s signature mix of politics, business, pop culture, true crime and everything in between. Subscribe here! OpenAI has been focused on expanding its AI reach across Europe and Asia in order to preserve some industry dominance. “We want to make sure democratic AI wins over authoritarian AI,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in May. China’s lower price tags could pressure US rivals like OpenAI and Anthropic to justify their own prices. “DeepSeek is overall the same quality but 17 times cheaper,” Oleg Zankov, co-founder of Latenode, which helps clients build custom AI tools, told the Journal. Many Chinese bots are also released as open-source models, meaning tweaks can be made, which has made them even more competitive. Developers have created more than 100,000 derivative models based on Alibaba’s flagship open-source model, according to Alibaba. And clients concerned about data security might also prefer open-source models that can be taken offline. Advertisement

[You may also click here for additional information] NEW YORK, July 02, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a leading national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against DoubleVerify Holdings, Inc. (“DoubleVerify” or the “Company”) (NYSE: DV) and reminds investors of the July 21, 2025 deadline to seek the role of lead plaintiff in a federal securities class action that has been filed against the Company. Faruqi & Faruqi is a leading national securities law firm with offices in New York, Pennsylvania, California and Georgia. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since its founding in 1995. See www.faruqilaw.com. As detailed below, the complaint alleges that the Company and its executives violated federal securities laws by making false and/or misleading statements and/or failing to disclose that: (a) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (b) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on Activation Services, the Company’s high-margin advertising optimization services segment, was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (c) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (d) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (e) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; (f) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities; and (g) as a result of the foregoing, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially false and/or misleading or lacked a reasonable basis. The complaint alleges that the truth was revealed on February 27, 2025, when DoubleVerify reported lower-than-expected fourth quarter 2024 sales and earnings due in part to reduced customer spending and the suspension of DoubleVerify services by a large customer. Defendants also disclosed that the shift of ad dollars from open exchanges to closed platforms was negatively impacting the Company. On this news, DoubleVerify's stock price dropped $7.83 per share, or 36%, from a closing price of $21.73 on February 27, 2025, to a closing price of $13.90 on February 28, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff is the investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought by the class who is adequate and typical of class members who directs and oversees the litigation on behalf of the putative class. Any member of the putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. Your ability to share in any recovery is not affected by the decision to serve as a lead plaintiff or not. Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP also encourages anyone with information regarding DoubleVerify’s conduct to contact the firm, including whistleblowers, former employees, shareholders and others.

Title: The battle for AI talent has been on an entirely different level

Time Published: 2025-07-02T14:14:41Z
Full Content:
Good morning. One group of people may have to pay the price for Elon Musk reigniting his feud with Donald Trump: Tesla investors. The company's stock dropped 5% on Tuesday after Trump highlighted how much assistance Musk has gotten from the US government. Tesla investors will be on tenterhooks again this morning. The EV maker is expected to release its second-quarter vehicle delivery numbers in the coming hours. Wall Street seems braced for disaster. In today's big story, the hiring frenzy of the past few weeks for elite AI talent has been unprecedented, with Meta and OpenAI offering tens of millions of dollars to lure top workers. Plus, take a second and subscribe to BI's Defense Tech, a weekly recap of the latest innovations and strategies in modern warfare, defense tech, and more! What's on deck Markets: Why one PE firm wants to buy Red Hot Chili Peppers' entire catalog. Tech: Senate leaves Big Tech on the cutting room floor. Business: Paramount is paying $16 million to settle Trump's "60 Minutes" lawsuit. But first, need to land a prodigy? Try being prodigal. If this was forwarded to you, sign up here. Can you imagine getting paid more in a year than you had predicted you would ever make in your entire life? For top AI talent, this has been the reality of recent weeks. "I would describe them as in a state of shock," said Deedy Das, an AI investor at Menlo Ventures. He was talking about three of his friends who are machine-learning engineers or AI researchers — Das said they've all been offered between $8 and $20 million in total compensation a year to join Meta. "It's honestly hard to digest." Tech companies have long paid top dollar for elite talent, but the recent hiring frenzy has been on an entirely different level. And it seems AI talent can't start soon enough. "They're pressuring them to drop out of school," says Bill Aulet, a managing director at MIT. Comparisons have been drawn between the bidding war for AI talent and sports franchises competing for star athletes, with some on X suggesting that researchers hire agents to represent them. The first sign of this new, turbo-charged war for AI talent came when Meta recruited Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang last month as part of a $14.3 billion deal to take a 49% stake in his company. Then, Sam Altman said Meta had tried to poach his best employees with $100 million signing bonuses. (Meta executives recently pushed back, saying that the signing bonuses were not that generous.) This week, BI reported that Mira Murati, the former CTO of OpenAI, has paid some talent around half a million dollars in salary for her new startup before even announcing a first funding round or a product. So, what's driving the frenzy? Two factors: A shortage of talent and an excess of money. There is a limited number of researchers and engineers capable of building foundational models — something in the neighborhood of 2,000 people, BI's Bergman writes. Meanwhile, companies like Meta, which is approaching a market capitalization of $2 trillion, have the resources to spare no expense in order to avoid falling behind — and, as we've seen, they're not hesitant to do whatever it takes. 1. The PE giant dreaming of Californication. Bain Capital is in talks to re-enter the music industry and it's teaming up with Warner Music to do so. If it goes through, its first purchase will be the entire Red Hot Chili Peppers catalog for $300 million. Music has proven to be a defensive investment over the years amid economic and market turmoil. 2. Jerome Powell may have just escalated his beef with Trump. The Fed chair said on Tuesday that the president's tariff policy is to blame for the central bank's lack of rate cuts, and it remains in a wait-and-see position until the impact of tariffs becomes clearer. The president has hinted at replacing Powell, and here's what could happen if he follows through. 3. Three investing mistakes to avoid at a market high. Stocks are back near record highs after a tumultuous couple of months, Wall Street analysts are optimistic about the second half of 2025. That said, don't fall for these common investing missteps when the market's up. 1. Big Tech has one less reason to like President Donald Trump's "Big Beautiful Bill." Early Tuesday morning, senators voted 99-1 to strike a section in the bill aimed at preventing states from regulating AI. Tech leaders had argued that it was important not to hamper the AI industry at a time when competition with China is heating up. 2. What's going on between Microsoft and OpenAI? Both companies are currently renegotiating their multibillion-dollar partnership, which gives Microsoft access to OpenAI's technology. Precisely what OpenAI has to share — and when — is sometimes gray, people involved in the matter exclusively told BI's Ashley Stewart, and that's the central issue for Microsoft in these negotiations. 3. Threads finally gained one long-awaited feature. DMs have arrived on Meta's text-based social media network. The change was instituted after it became clear that users were interacting with a different crowd on Threads than on Instagram, BI's Pranav Dixit writes. 1. Paramount is paying $16 million to settle Trump's "60 Minutes" lawsuit. The suit, filed in October, alleged that an interview with Trump's presidential rival, Kamala Harris, had been selectively edited to "tip the scales in favor of the Democratic party" during November's election. Paramount emphasized that its statement did not include an apology or a statement of regret. Read more. 2. China's coffee giant is now brewing in America. Luckin Coffee opened two stores in Manhattan, offering a menu full of fruity specialties at extremely discounted prices. BI's reporter wasn't wowed but said it could take a bite out of Starbucks' sales. 3. RIP Bolt's unlimited PTO. The company's CEO Ryan Breslow announced it was eliminating its unlimited PTO policy and offering four mandatory paid weeks off instead. Breslow wrote on LinkedIn that when time off isn't defined "the good ones don't take PTO," and "the bad ones take too much." Tesla reports Q2 production and delivery figures.

Title: How large are large language models? (2025)
URL: https://gist.github.com/rain-1/cf0419958250d15893d8873682492c3e

Instantly share code, notes, and snippets. This aims to be factual information about the size of large language models. None of this document was written by AI. I do not include any information from leaks or rumors. The focus of this document is on base models (the raw text continuation engines, not 'helpful chatbot/assistants'). This is a view from a few years ago to today of one very tiny fraction of the larger LLM story that's happening. *Llama 7B, 13B, 33B, 65B: The 65B model was pretrained on a 1.4T (trillion tokens) dataset. LLaMA was officially stated to use Books3 source as a data set - this is a very important dataset which has been pivotal in lawmaking regarding the training of AIs on large amounts of copyrighted and potentially pirated material. Llama-3.1 405B (2024): The 405B llama model was released. This is a dense transformer model, meaning all parameters are used in inference passes. Initial pretraining: 2.87T tokens, long context: 800B, annealing: 40M - so 3.67T total. source: The Llama 3 Herd of Models. By this point meta has learned to say less about what data goes into the models "We create our dataset for language model pre-training from a variety of data sources containing knowledge" - so I can't say as much about what goes into the training data here. Empirically, we find that annealing (see Section 3.4.3) on small amounts of high-quality code and mathematical data can boost the performance of pre-trained models on key benchmarks The emerging trend of annealing pretrained models to 'benchmax' is unfortunate in that it biases the base language models somewhat away from being pure text continuation engines. This should really be part of the post-training which aims to make the models role play as some kind of AI-chatbot helpful assistant character. But these companies care very much about metrics and scores. For a long time, there weren't really any large language models available to download. There was certainly nothing comparable with GPT-3 for a few years. There were projects to try to match it, but generally they operated by fine tuning things like small (70B) llama models on a bunch of GPT-3 generated texts (synthetic data - which can result in degeneration when AI outputs are fed back into AI training intputs). The release of 405B was a turning point here. Just before that (Dec 2023) Mistral released Mixtral 8x7B - a MoE model, and then in April 2024 Mixtral-8x22B was released - a 141B total, A39B sparse MoE model. Even though this was not a dense model, like GPT-3 (175B) it is comparable in total parameter size. The MoE arch. enabled larger models to be trained and used by more people - people without access to thousands of interconnected GPUs. This was released the day after Christmas 2024. In the words of the deepseek webpage: deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3-Base paper. This was a gigantic leap forward in model size, and when R1 (the reasoning model built on top of this base model) was released it impressed a lot of people, I think this may have been the first time a truly GPT-4 level model was available to download and use. For reasons unclear this temporarily tanked the NVDA stock price. This really opened the door to new large MoE language models being trained, especially in China, and released freely for people to use. Note the following models are also starting to be multi-modal, as well as multi-linguial, so they have been provided large amounts of new types of data during training. Compared to other open MoE models like Mixtral-8x7B and Grok-1, DBRX is fine-grained, meaning it uses a larger number of smaller experts. DBRX has 16 experts and chooses 4, while Mixtral-8x7B and Grok-1 have 8 experts and choose 2. https://huggingface.co/MiniMaxAI/models#repos https://huggingface.co/MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-Text-01 https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.08313 456B A45.9B Attention, Softmax Attention and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). Building upon the architecture design and computation optimizations, we train our foundational language model, MiniMax-Text-01 To assess document quality at a granular level, we utilize our previous-generation model as the reward labeler (a MoE model with 5B activations and 60B total parameters). dots.llm1 achieves performance comparable to Qwen2.5-72B after pretrained on high-quality corpus without synthetic data Architecture: Multi-head Attention with QK-Norm in attention Layer, fine-grained MoE utilizing top-6 out of 128 routed experts, plus 2 shared experts. During the training stage, the shared expert remains perpetually active, while only 8 non-shared experts are activated simultaneously. It is not clear to me how many tokens the base model here was trained on but the hf page says "trillions". For a long time there were very very few LLMs on the same scale as GPT-3 that are available. Attempts to match GPT-3 level performance with downloadable weights were hindered by this, and genuinely, I do not think people understood that the raw size of the model being comparable to 175B was required. All that was available were the <=70B llama models and people tried to work with them. 405B is the latest large dense base model available that I'm aware of, but it's annealed and contains recent data in its pretraining (meaning that there will be people discussing LLMs and sharing logs and transcripts of LLMs), so it's a little bit more like an 'assistant' than previous base models. The same flaws apply to the recent wave of MoE models. They also have some aspets of Chinese culture baked into them. It's not completely clear how to compare MoE models with dense models. Perhaps there are aspects of LLM-intelligence that can only be achieved with sufficient depth/density. I don't think the current automated benchmarks are able to capture this, so everyone is just going all in on MoEs now. Newer models might be trained with new architectures (RWKV, byte-latent, bitnet), or new techniques of synthetic data generation (to avoid lawsuits, and to get good scores on benchmarks), but it's unclear how important these things really are for making a good raw text continuation engine - which I believe is the foundation for the capabilities that whatever type of fine-tuning elicits from these neural networks. Currently the trend is to make chatbots that roleplay as 'ai assistants' - and I really hope that more people investigate alternatives. There was an error while loading. Please reload this page.

The feature from tokenization firm Backed, rolled out on centralized exchanges Kraken and Bybit this week in certain regions and also launched natively on the Solana blockchain, allows traders to gain exposure to popular American equities like Meta, Netflix, Coinbase, McDonald’s, and more on-chain. In other words, eligible users can swap crypto or fiat for stocks on the aforementioned exchanges, or swap any Solana token for the xStock of their choosing via decentralized protocols like Jupiter or Raydium. still can't believe you can now swap between fartcoin and USA stocks, permissionlessly, across the globe with just an internet connection and a solana wallet internet capital markets pic.twitter.com/8Mmyy47dnz — mert | helius.dev (@0xMert_) June 30, 2025 While tokenized stocks, or the process of putting shares of companies on-chain, is not a new idea, xStocks differs from previous implementations that simply reflected the price of an off-chain asset with a “mirrored” asset on-chain. Instead, each xStock token is backed 1:1 by the underlying asset which is held by a regulated third-party. In other words, a user that purchases a share of Apple on-chain via xStocks is assured that their single share of Apple is held in custody and redeemable at any time. “For the first time, people all over the world can own and use a share of a tokenized stock like they would use money. You can move it, hold it, spend it, or borrow against it. All from your wallet, with no intermediaries, no borders and no delays,” said Kraken co-CEO Arjun Sethi in a statement about the platform’s xStock launch. According to Backed, trading tokenized stocks like xStocks offers a handful of benefits that users trading via a traditional brokerage would not get. For example, xStocks allows users to trade 24/7, while a brokerage is subject to the stock market’s hours. Additionally, their use on global blockchains allows participants in other geographies to gain exposure to the American stock market, and for trades to take place without broker commissions. It also makes equities available for use in decentralized finance (DeFi). While Kraken and Bybit have tapped Backed and its xStocks product for its tokenized equities, other platforms are looking to build their own tokenized product suites. Coinbase has been seeking regulatory approval to offer tokenized stocks on its platform, with its Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal calling that approval a “huge priority” in June. Furthermore, Robinhood announced Monday that it is rolling out tokenized stock trading to its European users, allowing them to trade U.S.-listed stocks via Ethereum layer-2 network Arbitrum. The firm also plans to launch its own dedicated layer-2 blockchain powered by Arbitrum, and migrate the service to that chain.

Title: These Stocks Soared in the First Half of 2025. Can They Keep It Up?

The stock market shook off one of its worst sell-offs in recent memory to finish the first half of 2025 on a high note. That's lifted stocks associated with AI, crypto—and gold. How did we get here? It's been a ride. Stocks plummeted in early April after President Donald Trump unveiled sweeping global tariffs that threatened to scramble global supply chains, spike prices, and slow growth. Trump's subsequent pause of those tariffs, however, ignited a rally that was further fueled by benign economic data and easing trade tensions. By the end of June, stocks had rebounded to record highs. Wall Street's latest rally has looked a bit like last year's bull market. Artificial intelligence continued to connect many of the market's winners. But a few new themes have emerged amid the Trump administration's shake-up of the status quo. Here, we'll examine the stock market's leaders from the first six months of 2025—and examine how the forces underlying their gains could evolve in the next six. Crypto investors have been handsomely rewarded for the industry’s spending on November’s election. The industry last year spent more than $100 million in support of pro-crypto candidates. In January, the “most pro-crypto Congress” in history was sworn in and Washington wasted little time giving the industry what it wanted. Federal regulators have dropped pending litigation against cryptocurrency companies. Trump signed an executive order establishing a Bitcoin reserve. In May, the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, which would establish a framework for the regulation of cryptocurrencies, was introduced in the House of Representatives. And the Senate in June passed the GENIUS Act, legislation that establishes rules governing stablecoins. That's helped grow the cryptocurrency market's value to more than $3.2 trillion. Washington’s embrace, however, has also boosted related stocks this year. Robinhood (HOOD) stock more than doubled in price in the first half, while Coinbase (COIN) shares rose 41%. Circle Internet Group’s (CRCL) shares more than doubled during the stablecoin issuer’s first day of trading in early June; the stock rose nearly 750% in the two weeks after its debut. The cryptocurrency legislation working its way through Congress is expected to have little trouble making its way to Trump’s desk for signature in the second half of this year. Trump and his family may continue feeding the industry’s animal spirits with new crypto ventures. Analysts came into the year expecting the group of stocks considered emblematic of the AI trade to change. That has panned out to an extent. Leadership was expected to shift from AI infrastructure stocks—companies like Nvidia (NVDA), whose chips fill the data centers that cloud computing giants like Amazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) use to train and run AI models—to software and services providers developing and monetizing AI applications. Palantir (PLTR) was the best-performing stock in the S&P 500 in the first half of the year; its impressive sales and earnings growth have been driven primarily by its AI software. Social media giant Meta Platforms (META) is the Magnificent Seven’s best performer year-to-date thanks in part to its success introducing AI features that have improved performance metrics. Software stocks are expected to continue to outperform as they improve AI models and develop new applications. They could also benefit from their relative insulation from trade uncertainty, which dented the overall stock market’s returns in the first half. AI infrastructure, a theme that outperformed for most of 2024, continued to be a winner on Wall Street in the first half of this year. Tech giants Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (GOOG), and Meta looked through economic uncertainty and stood by plans to cumulatively spend hundreds of billions of dollars on property, buildings, and equipment this year. Much of that spending is earmarked for the technology required to develop and run advanced AI, like Nvidia chips, Super Micro Computer (SMCI) servers, and Amphenol (APH) fiber optic cables. Those hardware suppliers saw their shares rise 18%, 61%, and 42%, respectively, in the first half. The buildout of power-hungry data centers boosted the stocks of nuclear power providers, whose electricity is in demand from tech companies who say they are looking to shrink their carbon footprints. Shares of Constellation Energy (CEG) and Vistra (VST) advanced 44% and 41%, respectively. But bringing new nuclear power online is a long process, and data centers are in the meantime relying on natural gas, boosting the stocks of gas-fired plant operators like NRG Energy (NRG), up 78% year-to-date, and gas turbine makers like GE Vernova (GEV), up 61%. Experts expect the AI infrastructure trade to be resilient. Tech giants “are planning for long-term data center capacity requirements and won’t alter their investment plans based on tariff regimes that change from week to week,” said Shaon Baqui, tech equities analyst at Janus Henderson Investors. The mood globally in the first half of 2025 was tense, to put it mildly. That was good for gold. In five months, the second Trump administration launched a global trade war targeting friends and foes alike; opened questions about America's commitment to longtime alliances like NATO; increased America’s involvement in Israel’s conflict with its neighbors; and ratcheted up tensions with China. Investors who sought stability turned to gold, a time-honored safe-haven asset. Gold prices climbed to record high after record high, peaking at more than $3,450 on June 13, the day Israel launched attacks on Iran’s nuclear program. Shares of gold miner Newmont (NEM) followed prices higher, rising 56% over the first half of the year. Fellow miners Barrick (B) and Agnico Eagle Mines (AEM) advanced 34% and 52%, respectively. Central banks, wary of inflation and their reliance on U.S.-controlled reserve assets, have been major buyers of gold in recent years. Demand for gold is expected to remain high for the foreseeable future as governments around the world seek to hedge against elevated geopolitical tensions and an uncertain global economic outlook. The World Gold Council’s most recent Central Bank Gold Reserves survey found that nearly all central banks expect global gold reserves to increase over the next 12 months. A record 43% of respondents said they plan to add to their gold holdings over the same period.

Title: Meta stock hits a record high as Mark Zuckerberg reveals poached new recruits from OpenAI, Anthropic and Google

Beatrice Nolan is a London-based reporter at Fortune covering tech. Meta stock hit an all-time high on Monday following the news that CEO Mark Zuckerberg had recruited an all-star Superintelligence team that includes key architects of ChatGPT, Google’s Gemini, and its image-gen tech. The company’s stock peaked at $747.90 during Monday trading, beating Meta’s previous record set in February this year. Shares closed Monday at a record $738.09, marking a 23% year-to-date gain. Investors cheered the company’s aggressive push into AI and its hiring spree of talent from major rivals in the space, including OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic. Meta’s new Chief AI Officer Alexandr Wang posted the list of new recruits on X. Wang recently joined the company as part of a deal that saw Meta investing up to $15 billion for a 49% stake in his training data company, ScaleAI. Zuckerberg reportedly told staff that former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman will co-lead the group with Wang. “I’m excited to be the Chief AI Officer, working alongside [Nat Friedman],” he wrote in a post. “We also have several strong new team members joining today or who have joined in the past few weeks that I’m excited to share as well.” The team includes several prominent former OpenAI researchers, including: Representatives for OpenAI did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fortune, made outside normal working hours. Zuckerberg has reportedly been personally recruiting for Meta’s new 50-person “Superintelligence” AI team, reportedly offering $100m signing bonuses to woo top OpenAI researchers, according to CEO Sam Altman. OpenAI is reportedly scrambling to contain the fallout after a wave of high-profile researcher departures to Meta, with Chief Research Officer Mark Chen likening the exodus to a home invasion. In a memo obtained by Wired, Chen told employees that OpenAI’s leadership team, including Altman, had been working “around the clock” to retain the company’s top talent, urgently recalibrating compensation and seeking “creative” ways to reward top performers. While Altman publicly complained about rumored $100 million signing bonuses, Meta has internally disputed the figure. In a recent all-hands meeting shared with The Verge, Meta’s CTO Andrew Bosworth said the actual offers Meta was making were more complicated and implied that only a few very senior people may have been offered that kind of money. He clarified that “the actual terms of the offer” weren’t just “sign-on bonus” but rather “all these different things.” © 2025 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

Title: Seagate Stock To $85?

ByTrefis Team ByTrefis Team, Contributor. CANADA - 2025/05/07: In this photo illustration, the Seagate Technology logo is seen displayed on a ... More smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Thomas Fuller/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Question: How would you respond if you owned Seagate (NASDAQ: STX) and its value plummeted by 60% or more in the upcoming months? While this may seem extreme, it is not without precedent. Seagate's stock has experienced such severe declines previously, and based on its current valuation, history might repeat itself. Up to this point in 2025, Seagate has achieved an impressive 65% return year-to-date, significantly exceeding the S&P 500’s 5% increase. This rise has been driven by structural improvements in the company and a timely shift towards next-gen technologies like HAMR (Heat Assisted Magnetic Recording). Seagate is currently benefiting from a upswing in the data-storage market, which is being bolstered by the increasing demand for generative AI and cloud infrastructure. However, behind the AI enthusiasm and operational improvements lies a more cautionary narrative. Separately see, What’s Next For Nike Stock? Here’s the point: The main takeaway is that during a downturn, Seagate stock could suffer considerable losses. Data from 2020 shows that STX stock lost around 35% of its value within just a few quarters, experiencing a peak-to-trough drop of about 58% during the 2022 inflation crisis, underperforming significantly compared to the S&P 500. This raises the question: Could the stock see a sell-off and potentially fall to $85 if a similar scenario were to occur? As a rule, individual stocks tend to be more volatile than diversified portfolios. Consequently, if you seek growth with decreased volatility, you might want to investigate the High-Quality portfolio, which has outperformed the S&P 500 and yielded returns over 91% since its launch. Seagate produces high-capacity HDDs (hard disk drives)—essential infrastructure for storing the immense datasets necessary for training and deploying large language models (LLMs). While SSDs (solid-state drives) are the go-to choice for fast-access storage, HDDs remain dominant in cold storage and hyperscale cloud archives—key applications for companies such as Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon. Seagate introduced its Mozaic 3+ platform last year, which achieves 3 TB per platter through HAMR technology and incorporates it into its Exos 30 TB+ drives, which have already begun shipping to hyperscale cloud clients. At its June 2025 investor conference, Seagate announced that engineering samples of 40 TB HAMR drives (10×4 TB platters) have already been delivered, with mass production anticipated in the first half of FY 2026. The company intends to launch Mozaic 4+ with 40 TB+ capacity in 2026, followed by Mozaic 5+ providing 50 TB+ drives by 2028, and is aiming for 100 TB HDDs by 2030 as part of its larger HAMR roadmap. While this technological advancement positions Seagate for long-term growth, it also introduces execution risks if demand does not scale as expected. Seagate forecasts Q4 adjusted EPS (June fiscal year) to be between $2.20 and $2.60, with revenue expected between $2.25–$2.55 billion. Consensus is predicting 38% revenue growth in FY 2025 and 13% in FY 2026. Nevertheless, even solid growth expectations cannot safeguard the stock from macroeconomic shocks, valuation declines, or operational setbacks. With very little margin for error, any misstep could lead to a steep correction. STX stock has performed worse than the benchmark S&P 500 index during several recent downturns. While investors remain hopeful for a soft landing for the U.S. economy, how severe could it get if another recession occurs? Our dashboard How Low Can Stocks Go During A Market Crash illustrates how key stocks performed during and after the last six market crashes. • STX stock decreased 58.2% from a high of $116.02 on 4 January 2022 to $48.49 on 3 November 2022, compared to a peak-to-trough decline of 25.4% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 27 May 2025 • Since then, the stock has risen to a high of $141.44 on 29 June 2025 • STX stock fell 35.6% from a high of $63.23 on 24 January 2020 to $40.73 on 20 March 2020, vs. a peak-to-trough decline of 33.9% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 4 December 2020 • STX stock dropped 89.1% from a high of $28.60 on 2 November 2007 to $3.11 on 23 January 2009, compared to a peak-to-trough decline of 56.8% for the S&P 500 • The stock fully recovered to its pre-Crisis peak by 18 April 2012 Currently, Seagate trades at 18x consensus 2025 earnings, significantly above its three-year average of only 5x. Its price-to-sales ratio has escalated to 3x, rising from 1.2x in FY 2022. Even its forward P/S of 3x surpasses the three-year average of 2.8x. In comparison, Western Digital (NASDAQ: WDC), a direct competitor, typically trades around 1x P/S during market downturns. Investor confidence is evidently reflected in the stock’s elevated valuation—but with greater height comes a steeper potential fall. The average analyst price target of $125 suggests an 11% downside, even without factoring in a market correction. Considering the wider economic uncertainties, ask yourself this: Do you plan to hold onto your Seagate stock now, or will you panic and sell if it starts to drop to $100, $90, or even lower? Hanging onto a declining stock is never an easy task. Trefis partners with Empirical Asset Management—an investment firm in the Boston area—whose asset allocation strategies produced positive returns during the 2008-09 period when the S&P lost over 40%. Empirical has integrated the Trefis HQ Portfolio into its asset allocation framework to offer clients better returns and less risk compared to the benchmark index—a smoother journey, as evidenced in HQ Portfolio performance metrics.

This occurred despite growing evidence of a slowing economy and continued trade angst.1 Meanwhile, the DJIA is still -2.65% away from its 12/4/24 peak (45,014.04) and the small cap Russell 2000 remains off more than -11% from its 11/25/24 high (2,442.03).2 This isn’t a surprise to us as the industrial economy and especially small caps always feel an economic slowdown before it becomes mainstream. In addition, the DJIA and Russell 2000 have many fewer tech companies, the sector where the action is. The consolidated reporting charts are for informational purposes only and should not replace the ... More official reporting made available by each index, custodian, market and/or security. The table above shows that all the major indexes had a good week and month. For the year, the S&P 500 is up about 5% (about where is should be halfway through a typical 10% growth year), while the other three major indexes are lagging. The Nasdaq is up less than 1% while the DJIA (industrials) and the Russell 2000 (small cap) are underwater year to date (with the Russell 2000 off more than -5%). So, a mixed bag.1 2 Five of the Magnificent 7 (NVDA, MSFT, AMZN, META and GOOG) enjoyed a prosperous week. AAPL and TSLA were marginally positive. For the year to date, it is really a mixed bag. AAPL and TSLA are down nearly -20%, and GOOG is down more than -6%. Meanwhile META, NVDA and MSFT show substantial gains, while AMZN is just keeping its head above water. Nevertheless, on Friday, NVDA closed at a new record high.3 4 The consolidated reporting charts are for informational purposes only and should not replace the ... More official reporting made available by each index, custodian, market and/or security. The Consumer As the consumer goes, so goes the economy. So, when the consumers’ income falls, or inflation rises faster than that income, real consumption growth is negatively impacted. So, it isn’t good news to learn that personal earnings (excluding government transfers) fell in May (-0.1%) and have been negative in three of the past four months. Perhaps this is responsible for the -0.1% drop in consumer spending in May which, after including the effects of inflation, amounts to -0.3% in real terms. There was a fall in spending on durable goods of -1.8%, -0.3% for non-durables, and services were essentially flat (-0.03%).5 There are other signs of consumer discomfort. One such sign is the rise in the number of multiple job holders. This occurs when the income from a single job isn’t sufficient to maintain that worker’s lifestyle. Either live at a lower level or get a second job! The chart shows a steady upward trend in this statistic since the pandemic.6 Bureau of Labor Statistics Other such signs can be seen in the delinquency rates on consumer loans. Delinquencies on mortgages, auto loans and consumer credit are on the rise. The left-hand side of the chart below shows that credit card balances are at record levels as consumers try to maintain their standard of living (Charge it now – worry about paying for it later!). Note the rapid rise in delinquencies (right-hand side of the chart below) in the post-pandemic period. Note that while credit card delinquencies of 90+ days appear to have come down recently, this is most likely due to increased write-offs of such debt by the financial (bank) system.7 8 FRBNY Consumer Credit Panel, Equifax, Bloomberg Finally, a look at the major retailer reports reinforces the aggregate data. Best Buy, for example, recently cut its sales forecast for 2025. Kohl’s reported -3.9% sales growth in Q1, and went on to forecast -5% to -7% for 2025 as a whole. Foot Locker reported that sales fell -2.6% from year earlier levels, and Hormel trimmed its earnings outlook.5Housing As always, housing is a good indicator of the economy’s economic health. The left-hand side of the chart below shows the slowdown in Existing Home Sales over the past couple of years, and the right-hand side indicates the rapid rise in the months’ supply of inventory at current sales rates (now higher than the pandemic peak). This is a sign of growing weakness and inevitably leads to a slowdown in new home construction with spillover effects into the labor market. National Association of Realtors and Bureau of Labor Statistics Note in the New Home Sales chart below the horizontal trend since 2023 and the latest turndown in 2025. U.S. Census Bureau As demand stagnates, so do home prices. As seen from the chart below, the median sales price of new homes has stagnated for the past two years. Final Thoughts Equity markets continued their upward path the week ended June 27th with record highs for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. It was a good week and a good month for stocks. But this rising tide has put the P/E ratio significantly above its long-term mean. Investors beware! For 2025, the S&P 500 leads the pack, up nearly 5%, while small-caps also carry a “5” growth number, but with a negative sign.1 2 It was also a positive week for all of the Magnificent 7 (AAPL barely so). Year-to-date, the stock prices of four of the Mag 7 are positive and three are negative, with AAPL and TSLA each down nearly -20%!3 4 As the consumer goes, so does the economy. One can see the stress developing in the consumer sector by looking at the rising trend of multiple job holders and the rise in both credit card balances and 90+ day delinquencies.6 7 8 Housing is always a bellwether of the economy. The fact that Existing Home Sales have tanked and New Home Sales have flatlined tells an astute observer that the economy has entered rocky ground.

Title: Coffee Break: OpenAI as The Money Pit

OpenAI has fatally flawed finances which reveal a company that presents no serious threat to any of the tech incumbents, including Google. In the (excellent) comments to my post last Monday on Google’s inexplicable-to-me decision to risk their search monopoly by going all-in on LLM AI one from Hickory exposed that I had failed to make a key point: ChatGPT is not a threat to replace Google as the leader in search because OpenAI loses money on every ChatGPT prompt and is trying to make it up in volume. Let’s put aside the claims about LLMs having reasoning ability for now and focus on the bullish business case for ChatGPT as a killer app that threatens Google search. Cal Newport lays out that case: The application that has… leaped ahead to become the most exciting and popular use of these tools is smart search. If you have a question, instead of turning to Google you can query a new version of ChatGPT or Claude. These models can search the web to gather information, but unlike a traditional search engine, they can also process the information they find and summarize for you only what you care about. Want the information presented in a particular format, like a spreadsheet or a chart? A high-end model like GPT-4o can do this for you as well, saving even more extra steps. Smart search has become the first killer app of the generative AI era because, like any good killer app, it takes an activity most people already do all the time — typing search queries into web sites — and provides a substantially, almost magically better experience. This feels similar to electronic spreadsheets conquering paper ledger books or email immediately replacing voice mail and fax. I would estimate that around 90% of the examples I see online right now from people exclaiming over the potential of AI are people conducting smart searches. This behavioral shift is appearing in the data. A recent survey conducted by Future found that 27% of US-based respondents had used AI tools such as ChatGPT instead of a traditional search engine. From an economic perspective, this shift matters. Earlier this month, the stock price for Alphabet, the parent company for Google, fell after an Apple executive revealed that Google searches through the Safari web browser had decreased over the previous two months, likely due to the increased use of AI tools. Keep in mind, web search is a massive business, with Google earning over $175 billion from search ads in 2023 alone. In my opinion, becoming the new Google Search is likely the best bet for a company like OpenAI to achieve profitability… That’s a seemingly reasonable claim, but doesn’t hold up after a look into OpenAI’s business plans for ChatGPT. Despite their seeming threat to Google search, OpenAI is the kind of self-defeating competition no monopolist should fear, much less destroy its proven business model to compete with. The New York Times put it pretty well last September: pic.twitter.com/As1hKPAqtB — Nat Wilson Turner (@natwilsonturner) June 30, 2025 Morningstar summed up the NYT’s reporting well: Financial documents reviewed by The New York Times reveal a company burning through cash at an alarming rate, raising questions about the sustainability of its current trajectory and the potential risks of prioritizing break-neck expansion over responsible AI development. Let’s discuss some of the key points from the New York Times report, which was published last week before the funding announcement: — OpenAI’s monthly revenue hit $300 million in August 2024, a 1,700% increase since early 2023. — The company expects to generate around $3.7 billion in annual sales this year and anticipates revenue ballooning to $11.6 billion in 2025. — Despite rising revenues, OpenAI predicts a loss of about $5 billion. this year due to high operational costs, biggest of which is the cost of computing power it gets through its partnership with Microsoft. — OpenAI predicts its revenue will hit $100 billion in 2029. The Times report raises serious questions about OpenAI’s sustainability and realistic goals. The company’s monthly revenue growth from early 2023 to August 2024 is nothing short of explosive; however, the long-term projection of $100 billion in revenue by 2029 appears unrealistic. This figure would require sustaining an average annual growth rate of more than 90% for five consecutive years (93.3% to be precise, from an expected $3.7 billion in 2024 to $100 billion in 2029), a feat rarely achieved in the tech industry, especially for a company already operating at such a large scale. While impressive on paper, said projections may be masking underlying financial challenges and setting expectations that could be difficult, if not impossible, to meet. Financial challenges become even more apparent given the current expense structure in relation to projected growth. It’s crucial to note that, even if it reaches the projected revenue targets, OpenAI is not merely failing to break even in 2024 – it’s losing significantly more money than it’s generating. This means that before OpenAI can even consider achieving its ambitious growth targets, it must first find a way to become profitable, or at the very least, break even. Bryan McMahon pointed out the massive financial risk posed by the stock market bubble driven by faith in LLMs or as he calls it Generative AI: Venture capital (VC) funds, drunk on a decade of “growth at all costs,” have poured about $200 billion into generative AI. Making matters worse, the stock market’s bull run is deeply dependent on the growth of the Big Tech companies fueling the AI bubble. In 2023, 71 percent of the total gains in the S&P 500 were attributable to the “Magnificent Seven”—Apple, Nvidia, Tesla, Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, and Microsoft—all of which are among the biggest spenders on AI. Just four—Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta—combined for $246 billion of capital expenditure in 2024 to support the AI build-out. Goldman Sachs expects Big Tech to spend over $1 trillion on chips and data centers to power AI over the next five years. Yet OpenAI, the current market leader, expects to lose $5 billion this year, and its annual losses to swell to $11 billion by 2026. If the AI bubble bursts, it not only threatens to wipe out VC firms in the Valley but also blow a gaping hole in the public markets and cause an economy-wide meltdown. But wait it gets worse, per Ed Zitron: It seems, from even a cursory glance, that OpenAI’s costs are increasing dramatically. The Information reported earlier in the year that OpenAI projects to spend $13 billion on compute with Microsoft alone in 2025, nearly tripling what it spent in total on compute in 2024 ($5 billion). This suggests that OpenAI’s costs are skyrocketing, and that was before the launch of its new image generator which led to multiple complaints from Altman about a lack of available GPUs, leading to OpenAI’s CEO saying to expect “stuff to break” and delays in new products. Nevertheless, even if we assume OpenAI factored in the compute increases into its projections, it still expects to pay Microsoft $13 billion for compute this year. This number, however, doesn’t include the $12.9 billion five-year-long compute deal signed with CoreWeave, a deal that was a result of Microsoft declining to pick up the option to buy said compute itself. Payments for this deal, according to The Information, start in October 2025, and assuming that it’s evenly paid (the terms of these contracts are generally secret, even in the case of public companies), this would still amount to roughly $2.38 billion a year. I’ll let the Entertainment Strategy Guy nail the profitability coffin shut: By all accounts, right now, OpenAI is losing money. Like literally billions of dollars. The energy costs of LLMs are enormous. If they’re pricing their services below market value, trying to gain market share, then we don’t know if AI can make money for the service it’s providing right now. Two factors are driving these costs. First, the memory an AI program uses (either the more data it stores as it thinks or the longer it thinks about a problem/answer), the more it costs the AI companies in compute. Second, the AI companies are racing to build next-generation models that will require even more training, which means higher costs. And the salaries for top AI engineers/scientists are also sky-rocketing up. This is why I’m somewhat skeptical about the sorts of things that OpenAI is promising that AI can do (like become your universal assistant that remembers everything about you); it seems like an absolute memory boondoggle of monumental proportions. How much energy will it take for AI to analyze my whole life if it’s already too taxing for an LLM to remember how to format links properly? But wait, there’s even more bad news that just dropped. OpenAI is now in a bidding war for talent with some of the stupidest money out there, Mark Zuckerberg of Meta: …competition for top AI researchers is heating up in Silicon Valley. Zuckerberg has been particularly aggressive in his approach, offering $100 million signing bonuses to some OpenAI staffers, according to comments Altman made on a podcast with his brother, Jack Altman. Multiple sources at OpenAI with direct knowledge of the offers confirmed the number. The Meta CEO has also been personally reaching out to potential recruits, according to the Wall Street Journal. “Over the past month, Meta has been aggressively building out their new AI effort, and has repeatedly (and mostly unsuccessfully) tried to recruit some of our strongest talent with comp-focused packages,” Chen wrote on Slack. And speaking of dumb money and OpenAI, Softbank is involved, although maybe not as much as reported: (In April) OpenAI closed “the largest private tech funding round in history,” where it “raised” an astonishing “$40 billion,” and the reason that I’ve put quotation marks around it is that OpenAI has only raised $10 billion of the $40 billion, with the rest arriving by “the end of the year.” The remaining $30 billion — $20 billion of which will (allegedly) be provided by SoftBank — is partially contingent on OpenAI’s conversion from a non-profit to a for-profit by the end of 2025, and if it fails, SoftBank will only give OpenAI a further $20 billion. The round also valued OpenAI at $300 billion. And things might not be going so well with Softbank because OpenAI is now talking to even dumber, and much more dangerous, money: Saudi Arabia. And if you’ve ever paid attention to the actual words coming out of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s mouth, you’ll realize Altman attracting dumb money is just a case of birds of a feather flocking together. Ed Zitron chronicles some of the stupid in his latest newsletter: Here is but one of the trenchant insights from Sam Altman in his agonizing 37-minute-long podcast conversation with his brother Jack Altman from last week: “I think there will be incredible other products. There will be crazy new social experiences. There will be, like, Google Docs style AI workflows that are just way more productive. You’ll start to see, you’ll have these virtual employees, but the thing that I think will be most impactful on that five to ten year timeframe is AI will actually discover new science.” When asked why he believes AI will “discover new science,” Altman says that “I think we’ve cracked reasoning in the models,” adding that “we’ve a long way to go,” and that he “think[s] we know what to do,” adding that OpenAI’s o3 model “is already pretty smart,” and that he’s heard people say “wow, this is like a good PHD.” That’s the entire answer! It’s complete nonsense! Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, a company allegedly worth $300 billion to venture capitalists and SoftBank, kind of sounds like a huge idiot! Ed also roasts Alphabet/Google’s Sundar Pichai: Sundar Pichai, when asked one of Nilay Patel’s patented 100-word-plus-questions about Jony Ive and Sam Altman’s new (and likely heavily delayed) hardware startup: I think AI is going to be bigger than the internet. There are going to be companies, products, and categories created that we aren’t aware of today. I think the future looks exciting. I think there’s a lot of opportunity to innovate around hardware form factors at this moment with this platform shift. I’m looking forward to seeing what they do. We are going to be doing a lot as well. I think it’s an exciting time to be a consumer, it’s an exciting time to be a developer. I’m looking forward to it. The fuck are you on about, Sundar? Your answer to a question about whether you anticipate more competition is to say “yeah I think people are gonna make shit we haven’t come up with and uhh, hardware, can’t wait!” While I think Pichai is likely a little smarter than Altman, in the same way that Satya Nadella is a little smarter than Pichai, and in the same way that a golden retriever is smarter than a chihuahua. That said, none of these men are superintelligences, nor, when pressed, do they ever seem to have any actual answers. If ChatGPT were such an existential threat to Google’s search monopoly that Alphabet’s only option was risking the empire to beat OpenAI in the LLM race, it would be profitable or at least have a plausible path to profitability. Sam Altman being a blithering idiot isn’t really the disadvantage it should be since he’s going up against competition like Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, and Sundar Pichai. This isn’t like Uber vs. the local taxi incumbents in the 2010s where despite Uber’s never going to be profitable business model they were able to take over in many markets because OpenAI does not have a huge cash advantage over Alphabet and never will. Next week we’ll look at at Meta, the absolute stupidest tech money around — a company that put Dana White of the Ultimate Fighting Championship on its board. And because I promised I’d get around to this, regarding LLMs ability to “reason” it was thoroughly debunked last October by six researchers from Apple in a paper called “GSM-Symbolic: Understanding the Limitations of Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models.” When the paper was released the senior author, Mehrdad Farajtabar, tweeted that, ““we found no evidence of formal reasoning in language models …. Their behavior is better explained by sophisticated pattern matching—so fragile, in fact, that changing names can alter results by ~10%!” Veteran political operative and corporate media professional. One of the Ed Zitron pieces you cited: https://www.wheresyoured.at/openai-is-a-systemic-risk-to-the-tech-industry-2/ while quite long, goes deep into the details of OpenAI’s present and future financing and how they expect to meet their financial commitments over the next two or three years. It left me in a funk for several days, not because I care a whit about OpenAI, but because the business press has now apparently become so delusional and dishonest that it’s hard to believe anything or even see how things can go on. After reading this, I have to conclude that OpenAI/Softbank is definitely, positively going to go out of business in the next two or three years. How much of the rest of the economy they take down with it is perhaps more worrisome. This is the same business press that covered Uber and Lyft breathlessly for 15 years as Uber burnt through money.. because they wanted the businesses to succeed. The will do the same thing with OpenAI until they magically find profit. Kurtismayfield, yea but I don’t think the overall economy has the runway that Uber had in the 2010s. Gonna be some reality checks sooner rather than later. Yea, the LLM bubble popping might be the end of the “Everything Bubble” that George Soros wrote a whole book about 20 years ago As a complement to this piece, I recommend this lengthy interview with technology journalist Karen Hao about her recent book “Empire of AI: Dreams and Nightmares in Sam Altman’s OpenAI”. thanks! I will check it out. Agreed. It was excellent. I’m not so sure that taking over search or even making money are the real goals of these people. We had a story in Links today about LLMs ability to ensnare the lonely or unhappy into “relationships” that seem quite real to the victims. That could prove a handy tool if you’re a tech billionaire trying to take over the world or even a government seeking to disable potential dissidents. One emerging dystopia is a world where tech billionaires use AIs to battle each other for world control. The LLMs would be useful for “converting” people to their cause, while another type of AI could control huge drone swarms that attack opponents’ data centers. Philip K. Dick could make a fun novel out of that possibility. excellent point. I’m always missing the story because I’m busy arguing the rational explanation. Like trying to evaluate today’s stonk market based on business fundamentals or betting on professional wrestling based on the athleticism of the performers. LLM’s ability to persuade might indeed be the killer app. What dark magick! That is in fact VULCAN’S HAMMER from 1959, or damned close to it, IIRC. It’s almost universally agreed to be Dick’s worst novel, for completions only. but Dick’s visionary abilities make even his least essential work of interest. It certainly wasn’t his mastery of prose. Apologies, I read the post before I saw your comment which I duplicated below. Karen Hao has substantial insights into the broader questions. “Second, the AI companies are racing to build next-generation models that will require even more training, which means higher costs.” “Training” Data mining that amounts to wealth transfers and even more opportunities for surveillance and control of the flow of information are going to be the main outcome. Yea Gary Marcus is saying surveillance is where OpenAI is headed, I’ll get into that in a future post although even there Palintir is way ahead of them and is infamously using AI widely in Gaza and everywhere else. There is a lot to be said for local inference. “Fast” and “easy” are not usually among them. I will say that the installation process is slowly getting easier for the suitably equipped general user, month by month. Consider also the possibility of OpenAI or other chatbot providers being a regulatory arbitrage bid with broader ambitions, sort of like Uber. The anti-AI partisans, supplied with scary developments by researchers, are helping create the conditions for the enclosure of local private computation, with the economic and surveillance effects you’d imagine. The “Singapore Consensus on Global AI Safety Research Priorities” only hints at this eventuality. It does speak plainly to the general desire for surveillance among the participants, and utters some other uncomfortably guild-like noises. yikes. It’s easy to dismiss some of the “OMG AI is totes going to take over the world” crap as the opposite side of the coin of the hype but you’re right. There are a lot of very scary possibilities being worked toward even as the business idiots defraud believers for billions. Of course that’s scary too as they’re risking yet another financial collapse. I love dooming with this community! Everyone here is smarter than me and I’m learning a ton in these comment sections. Such a pleasant change from the various ridiculous and highly toxic electorates, “targets” and fandoms I’ve been writing for these last 28 years. To see where all this AI stuff may be headed, a viewing of “Forbidden Planet” might be predictive. Their version ruined it’s creators, the Krell,. I haven’t seen that since I was a kid and I didn’t have a clue what it was about. will give it a shot now Seconded. Not only is it a beautiful movie with stunning hand-painted sets, credible spacecraft and a great robot, but also the issues it addresses are more relevant now than when the movie was made. Human hubris and the human subconscious make for a dangerous pairing. Transhumanist dreams become nightmares. And Anne Francis is smokin’ hot. ok then, my friend’s documentary is going to have to wait As a complete ignoramus in these matters, I have long assumed the most likely financiers of AI are going to to be the US and Chinese militaries. I imagine no self-respecting general is going to want to fight a war of the future without feeling he has the superior AI. Am I missing something? Palintir has certainly used AI as a “killer app” in Gaza. But I don’t know much about what type of AI — if it’s machine learning or LLMs or what. I suspect it’s some of all types. No intelligent general would depend on AI because LLM based AIs are always very convincing but one out of three times they are flat out wrong. These mistakes are sometimes called “hallucinations.” I was not thinking of LLMs, but other forms of AI. Palantir and the IDF don’t care about hallucinations or wrong data, they don’t view their targets as human so they don’t care if they get a few extra victims while they’re targeting a doctor or journalist’s family for a synchronized multi-site assassination. for genocidal purposes hallucinations are a feature, not a bug “one out of three times they are flat out wrong.” Seems like better results than those delivered by our present intelligence agencies (the surveillance and control bureaucracies). So we can guarantee about 100% of generals will buy into it. Especially once a the hint of post military career board positions are offered. A young man our family knew when he was a high school student in Ljubljana desperate to come to America and work on AI now, nearly 20 years later, has a Silicon Valley start-up working on voice recognition and mimicry. Wonder who’s interested in that. all kinds of fun people, I’m sure. From MI6 to the Sinaloa Cartel… I think you are right for two reasons: 1. Drones with target matching that can take over in case of broken communication would make one main anti-drone defence on the battlefield in Ukraine much less useful. (Machine learning, not a chatbot) 2. Accountability sink. When the need comes to massacre civilians or POWs, it’s useful if the machine kills and can be blamed. Also it saves on PTSD treatment for the soldiers. See Gaza. Don’t know the business aspects, but ISTM that building the models and running the models are two different things. I have a couple of open source Hugging Face-type models here locally that I run in the open source Python environment on NVidia cuda with 6 Gb VRAM, though you need 12 or even 18 Gb to really be productive. As far as online, I’ve found I’m using Google-AI from their search where I might have used Stack Overflow in the past for simple programming solutions. Don’t see any monetization opportunities for Google from my usage. On a large open source project I work on, one dev has a MS CoPilot account and runs all the commits through it prior to merging. I don’t see any earth-shaking insights from it but it does in the main offer useful ideas. You haven’t seen CoPilot producing hallucinations? Oddly, I’ve found for basic Python, OpenAI’s Codex and its GitHub integration work surprisingly well. It’s still clearly a very early product and you can’t for example independently push to a PR branch and get Codex to update its working branch, but whatever. I was only using it for pretty straightforward personal things. Some of us are so old we can remember twenty five years ago when the web was considered a libertarian alternative to traditional media and the open source movement an ultimate expression of this. I still regard it that way and about half my searches go to information aggregator Wikipedia which is produced by humans if not always trustworthy humans. But whatever it’s flaws, I’d say Wiki is a lot more trustworthy than a money making robot run by investor sharks. If AI isn’t about surveillance then what else could this impractical technology possibly be about? True, from the above, it sounds like it is merely about suckering stock buyers. Balzac said behind every great fortune is a great crime and then W.C. Fields said you can’t cheat an honest man. Welcome to our world. Wiki (and Reddit) has been heavily manipulated by the worst actors on Earth for decades now. See Who’s Editing Wikipedia – Diebold, the CIA, a Campaign — Wired 2007 There’s also the rumor that Ghislaine Maxwell was a huge moderator on Reddit which has never been confirmed, but this Vice article “debunking” it has many of the tropes of other “debunkings” (see Vox.com’s 2020 covid coverage, the suppression of the NY Post’s 2020 election eve Hunter Biden laptop story or MSNBC on Russiagate to this day). Use of terms like “incoherent and evidence-free conspiracy theory”, “The ‘evidence’ shared by conspiracy theorists”….sets off alerts in the part of my brain that triggers PTSD when the phrase “unprovoked invasion of Ukraine” is encountered. Counterpoint, the theory was pushed hard by this Utah MAGA Senate candidate who at a glance is walking the anti-Zionist/anti-Semite line a little to closely for my comfort. Like others I don’t get much out of Reddit. And of course we all know about how Wales is not to be trusted and how Wikipedia is manipulated by the spooks. But also of course there are countless topics on Wikipedia that have nothing to do with the spooks. Everything is manipulated now to some degree but some formats are less susceptible than others. Walter Cronkite once said he picked all the stories for the evening news from that day’s NY Times. Now the Times is a joke https://www.moonofalabama.org/2025/06/nyt-guessing-about-iran-with-experts-who-lack-knowledge-of-it.html and we webians have to become our own gatekeepers and editors rather than rely on that dubious “first draft of history” (which I too once read avidly). Computers are a tool. You control them or they control you. my difficulty is dealing with normies who don’t become their own gatekeepers. watching the democrats go blue maga in the 2016-2024 era was pretty awful since that was my closest family and friends my GOP family and friends were always at a bit of an arm’s remove, cousins not siblings I think you’ll find the full-fat version is “Vladimir Putin’s brutal, unprovoked invasion of Ukraine”. Extra points for later references to Putin’s Chef, Putin’s Banker, Putin’s Thinker and other variations on his imagined menagerie of stock villain characters. Karen Hao, in an interview with Novara Media UK offers substantial information on the AI situation. Silicon Valley Insider Exposes Cult Like AI Companies As Artificial Intelligence begins to fundamentally alter the way normal people live their lives, it’s often talked about in terms of boom and doom, which makes a nuanced examination difficult. The problem with AI is that the understanding required to scrutinise the technology is rare and even if one does have that understanding, the ability to clearly communicate it is even rarer. This week’s guest has been both a worker in, and reporter on the tech industry and is uniquely poised to present a nuanced and informed analysis of this rapidly expanding industry. In her new book, ‘Empire of AI’, Karen Hao debunks myths that surround AI and exposes us to the full breadth of this global industry, from it’s cult-leader like CEOs to the workers that power the technology. She sat down with Aaron to talk about Sam Altman’s origin story, the traumatising nature of content moderation work and the striking similarities between Open AI and the British East India Company. IMO there is a case for LLMs becoming profitable but it involves injecting ads/propaganda directly into the answers. I’m sure companies and governments would pay large amounts of money to make sure that a model is biased in a way that directly benefits them. Of course, it requires getting to the point where people don’t have any alternatives to go back to. This makes Google’s destruction of the open web make sense on multiple levels The Sam Altman and Sundar Pichai quotes reminded me of this NewsRadio clip from the 90s: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lE1bS-Mn2Mk It would be funny if they weren’t running some of the biggest and most powerful companies in the world. I mean it’s easy to beat Google search these days because it’s been completely enshittified. I use Kagi – paying $100/year but I will never get a single ad. It’s like Google when Google was actually good. Well worth it. I’m doing the same, although on the monthly plan and never switched to annual. Worth noting unlike Neeva, Kagi doesn’t spider itself and just uses feeds from Google, Microsoft Bing, and a few others I think. Nonetheless, not being the product is worth paying $10 a month for. The specific survival of OpenAI isn’t of any particular interest to me personally, but DeepThink’s achievement of a 30x improvement in cost for training an effective model showed that the link between performance improvement and cost for such a new technology is not something that should be projected forward with any confidence. Whether that will save OpenAI itself, again, to me, who cares, but it seems likely to be relevant to the future ubiquity of the technology itself. DeepThink or DeepSeek? DeepSeek! Thank you Just clarifying because they’re very different animals. Very hard to tell how much of the claims made by DeepSeek are true. There is a true fog of propaganda war over that topic at the moment. It seems likely they did achieve significant efficiencies. It also seems entirely plausible that they did take advantage of OpenAI and others’ training data so it might not be replicable. This was my first thought. Just because chatgpt is unprofitable and expensive to operate now doesn’t mean that’s baked in to LLMs or “AI”. anyone who wants to evaluate whether it is wise for google to adopt LLMs in search needs to look at best-in-class in terms of cost like deepseek. Someone recently said the cost of AI converges to the cost of electricity over time. Deepseek’s improvements likely will be adopted by google eventually. What does the profitability look like at this point? I agree with many of the points in this article, but pointing out chatgpt’s unprofitability isn’t convincing. It’s very early stages and Chinese firms clearly show there’s massive room for cost savings. I saw one estimate that deepseek query costs are 3% of Chatgpt’s, so I think google’s decision should be judged with that future efficiency rate. also, whether or not chatgpt is a threat to google isn’t the issue. It’s whether LLMs and related ai tech is a threat, especially with 97% reduced query costs, and I think the answer is obviously yes. Natural language queries and responses are far more intuitive for most users and use cases than inputting a phrase and browsing links. Compare with asking “where is the nearest home depot” and being given the answer. It would be good to be skeptical of the reported cost advantages of Deepseek. I looked at it for my applications, which relate to cyber security for industrial control systems, and I was astounded by its ability to “reason.” (I’m going to sidestep here why I put quotes around “reason,” except to say the capability is valuable, even if it is not what humans do.) Back in February, my firm expectation was that every other engine would acquire the same reasoning capabilities within weeks or months. The fact that they have come nowhere close is suggestive that the cost advantages of Deepseek are not what they were claimed to be. A chunk of LLM API requests get redirected from places where money is real to OpenAI where the charges are on the order of 1/6 the price. Setting up your own compute to run your own models locally is pretty pricey, so if OpenAI craters it’s going to cause some pain in certain products currently subsidized by the magic of Silicon Valley. built in lack of resilience to the industry. OpenAI collapsing could be a singularity that pulls a lot of peripheral companies down into a black hole with it. “oops not the singularity we promised, does a minsky moment count?” Great post this and reading it, I can see a future direction that they will go in. That they will want the user to talk to the AI instead of just hammering on keys. That, come to think of it, was featured in the 2013 film “Her” which had a computer AI- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_(2013_film)#Plot They say that they want more training sets to make their AI better but where will those come from? They have ransacked the internet now and slurped it all up. They haven’t even set up standards for AI yet and we are still in the bananas stage- https://www.theregister.com/2025/06/27/bofh_2025_episode_12/ that’s one of the reasons Gary Marcus has known all along that the mass compute/big money/big scale approach wouldn’t work. they’re out of content to train on and the more the LLM generated content gets mixed in the worse the output gets There is lots of content left to train on. But it isn’t openly accessible stuff. Think of all the NHS data palantir will now get it’s hands on. All the data that various governments store. All the data corporations store. Hell even think about all the messages that get sent in Whatsapp and similar every day. All of that data is out that and not currently accesible. But it will be. and private phone conversations! I suspect Palintir, Meta, Alphabet, Amazon and others are grabbing “training data” that would shock and appall even the most jaded of us Oh, the Dems love “labor,” because the honchos give them (dues) money to run their campaigns during which they mouth platitudes about “working families.” But as far as supporting actual rank and file workers, not at all. You see these union politicians like Sean Fain (yes, he is for all intents and purposes a Dem Party neoliberal politician). The Dems co-opted the unions, and deal almost exclusively with high- and medium-level hacks like Fain, who think like they do. Please do not leave off topic comments. The place for this is Links. This is called thread-jacking and is a violation of our written site Policies. And there is this: Potemkin Understanding in Large Language Models As a search engine it’s OK at best, but in other regards it’s really not very reliable. this persuading people to believe crazy nonsense might be the killer app I failed to see when I did the initial post. very scary but as someone who’s spent decades in the “get attention > attempt to persuade” field I can see where that’s a high margin business provided they can cut way way down on the compute costs and energy burn. but I’m not sure the lack of need for high quality content relates to any technical cost savings. Anyone know? People already believe crazy nonsense Who needs AI? Well per MIT Technology Review “AI can do a better job of persuading people than we do: OpenAI’s GPT-4 is much better at getting people to accept its point of view during an argument than humans are—but there’s a catch.” There is a huge market to be able to control exactly what crazy nonsense specific individuals believe. This could replace advertising completely — provided they can dramatically reduce cost and energy use. Big provisions. Re tweet that the behavior of LLMs is best explained as “sophisticated pattern matching.” I agree with that, but I think a better and more incisive way of explaining LLMs is to simply say that they are all about mimicry. They are consummate con artists. They can sound just like a doctor without knowing medicine. They can sound just like a PhD without even knowing how to reason or think. Is that some huge human achievement, that we have developed a computer program that can mimic doctors and PhDs without actually knowing anything? To me, the answer is no. It’s not much of an achievement at all to develop automated con artists. Why do we need automated con artists that sound convincing but know nothing and have no value other than how convincing they sound? Several years back i overheard a senior enginer explaining to a junior one that “the key to being s consultant isn’t knowing more than the client, it’s bullshitting them that you know more”. Perhaps AI is kust a reflection of where society has already gone. it might be an achievement along the lines of Dr Frankenstein’s. I don’t pay any attention to the AI “features” in Google search, though that’s getting more and more difficult over time, because I don’t trust it not to make stuff up. I’m surprised more people aren’t likewise leery of it. word is getting out but reptition is the most powerful form of persuasion according to some and the whole tech industry is pushing this stuff on us over and over and over and over “The energy costs of LLMs are enormous.” Amongst all their BS and hype I can’t look past the energy aspect. Where will the affordable energy come from to power all of the data centres as they store increasing amounts of data, and the more data AI has to interrogate the more it consumes energy to ‘think’ (just consumes an increasingly larger amount of energy as it learns and grows)? The more I listen to energy experts discuss energy demand and affordable clean energy (is anything really clean considering the resources we dig up to build solar/wind capture infrastructure) the more I think AI will be limited by (clean/cleanish) energy availability. Based on current trends, humans will be limited by energy availability because AI has priority. Your email address will not be published. Required fields are marked * Comment * Name * Email *

(“DoubleVerify” or the “Company”) (NYSE: DV) common stock between November 10, 2023 and February 27, 2025, inclusive (the “Class Period”). IF YOU SUFFERED A LOSS ON YOUR DOUBLEVERIFY INVESTMENTS, CLICK HERE TO INQUIRE ABOUT POTENTIALLY PURSUING CLAIMS TO RECOVER YOUR LOSS UNDER THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS. What Happened? On May 7, 2024, DoubleVerify released its first quarter 2024 financial results and reduced its 2024 revenue guidance, disclosing that there had been a pullback in customer spending on advertising. On this news, DoubleVerify’s stock price fell $11.79, or 38.6%, to close at $18.78 per share on May 8, 2024, thereby injuring investors. Then, on February 27, 2025, DoubleVerify reported lower-than-expected fourth quarter 2024 sales and earnings due in part to reduced customer spending. The Company also disclosed that the shift of ad dollars from open exchanges to closed platforms was having a negative impact on the Company. On this news, DoubleVerify’s stock price fell $7.83, or 36%, to close at $13.90 per share on February 28, 2025. Then, on March 28, 2025, Adalytics Research, LLC published a report alleging, among other things, that DoubleVerify’s web advertisement verification and fraud protection services were ineffective and that its customers were regularly billed for ad impressions served to bots. The same day, The Wall Street Journal reported that DoubleVerify regularly missed detection of nonhuman traffic despite the Company’s claims that it helps brands avoid serving ads to nonhuman bot accounts. What Is The Lawsuit About? The complaint filed in this class action alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, Defendants failed to disclose to investors that: (1) DoubleVerify’s customers were shifting their ad spending from open exchanges to closed platforms, where the Company’s technological capabilities were limited and competed directly with native tools provided by platforms like Meta Platforms and Amazon; (2) DoubleVerify’s ability to monetize on its Activation Services was limited because the development of its technology for closed platforms was significantly more expensive and time-consuming than disclosed to investors; (3) DoubleVerify’s Activation Services in connection with certain closed platforms would take several years to monetize; (4) DoubleVerify’s competitors were better positioned to incorporate AI into their offerings on closed platforms, which impaired DoubleVerify’s ability to compete effectively and adversely impacted the Company’s profits; (5) DoubleVerify systematically overbilled its customers for ad impressions served to declared bots operating out of known data center server farms; (6) DoubleVerify’s risk disclosures were materially false and misleading because they characterized adverse facts that had already materialized as mere possibilities; and (7) as a result, Defendants’ positive statements about the Company’s business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. If you purchased or otherwise acquired DoubleVerify securities during the Class Period, you may move the Court no later than July 21, 2025 to request appointment as lead plaintiff in this putative class action lawsuit.

Key allegations in a recently filed securities fraud class action complaint against the company and certain of its officers have survived a motion to dismiss. That complaint alleges that Napco Security Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: NSSC), through certain of its officers and directors, made materially false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) Napco failed to address any material weaknesses with internal controls regarding cost of goods sold ("COGS") and inventory; (2) Napco downplayed the severity of material weaknesses regarding their internal controls; (3) Napco’s unaudited financial statements from September 30, 2022 to the present included “certain errors” such as overstating inventory and understanding net COGS, resulting in overstated gross profit, operating income and net income for each period; (4) as a result, Napco would need to restate its previously filed unaudited financial statements for certain periods; and (5) as a result, Defendants’ statements about its business, operations, and prospects, were materially false and misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis at all relevant times. On April 11, 2025, the federal court determined that key allegations would survive Defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint. In so holding, the court determined “Plaintiffs have adequately stated Exchange Act claims by pleading scienter [knowledge of wrongdoing] through defendants’ unusual stock sales and by plausibly alleging loss causation between the corrective announcement and stock price drop. Plaintiffs have also stated Securities Act claims against Napco and the underwriter defendants.” . . . “Taking the well-pleaded facts as true, there is no question that plaintiffs have adequately pled scienter. First, the stock sales were highly unusual in timing and amount. As to amount, the total proceeds of over $108 million from stock sales by the officer defendants weigh in favor of a motive. . . . And the officer defendants sold hefty percentages of their holdings – 48.5% for Soloway and 45.5% for Buchel.” What To Do Now: If you have held Napco shares since before November 7, 2022 and would like to learn more about this matter, please visit https://grabarlaw.com/the-latest/Napco-shareholder-investigation/, contact Joshua H.

Full Content:
Have you ever heard Sam Altman speak? I’m serious, have you ever heard this man say words from his mouth? Here is but one of the trenchant insights from Sam Altman in his agonizing 37-minute-long podcast conversation with his brother Jack Altman from last week: When asked why he believes AI will “discover new science,” Altman says that “I think we’ve cracked reasoning in the models,” adding that “we’ve a long way to go,” and that he “think[s] we know what to do,” adding that OpenAI’s o3 model “is already pretty smart,” and that he’s heard people say “wow, this is like a good PHD.” That’s the entire answer! It’s complete nonsense! Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, a company allegedly worth $300 billion to venture capitalists and SoftBank, kind of sounds like a huge idiot! “But Ed!” you cry. “You can’t just call Sam Altman an idiot! He isn’t stupid! He runs a big company, and he’s super successful!” My counter to that is, first, yes I can, I’m doing it right now. Second, if Altman didn’t want to be called stupid, he wouldn’t say stupid shit with a straight face to a massive global audience. My favourite part of the interview is near the beginning: This is a nonsensical conversation, and both of them sound very, very stupid. “So, is this going to make new science or make science faster?” “Yeah, I hear scientists are using AI to go faster [CITATION NEEDED], but if a human scientist goes three times faster [CITATION NEEDED] using my model that would be good. Also I heard from a guy that he heard a guy who did biology who said ‘this helped.’” Phenomenal! Give this guy $40 billion or more dollars every year until he creates a superintelligence, that’ll fucking work. Here are some other incredible quotes from the genius mind of Sam Altman: This is gobbledygook, nonsense, bullshit peddled by a guy who has only the most tangential understanding of the technology his company is building. Every single interview with Sam Altman is like this, every single one, ever since he became a prominent tech investor and founder. Without fail. And the sad part is that Altman isn’t alone in this. Sundar Pichai, when asked one of Nilay Patel’s patented 100-word-plus-questions about Jony Ive and Sam Altman’s new (and likely heavily delayed) hardware startup: The fuck are you on about, Sundar? Your answer to a question about whether you anticipate more competition is to say “yeah I think people are gonna make shit we haven’t come up with and uhh, hardware, can’t wait!” While I think Pichai is likely a little smarter than Altman, in the same way that Satya Nadella is a little smarter than Pichai, and in the same way that a golden retriever is smarter than a chihuahua. That said, none of these men are superintelligences, nor, when pressed, do they ever seem to have any actual answers. Let’s see what Satya Nadella of Microsoft answered when asked about how exactly it’s going to get to (and I paraphrase Dwarkesh Patel’s mealy-mouthed question) $130 billion in AI revenue “through AGI”: This quote has been used as a means of suggesting that Nadella is saying that “generative AI is generating basically no value,” which, while somewhat true, obfuscates its true meaning: Satya Nadella isn’t saying a fucking thing. The question was “how do you get Microsoft to $130 billion in revenue,” and Satya Nadella’s answer was to say “uhhh, abundance, uhhh, explosion, uhhhhh, GDP! Growth! Industrial revolution! Inflation-adjusted! Percentages! The winners will be the people who do stuff, and then productivity will go up!” This is fucking nonsense, and it’s time to stop idolizing these speciously-informed goobers. While kinder souls or Zitron-haters may read this and say “ahh, actually, what Nadella was saying was…” stop. I want to stop you there and suggest that perhaps a smart person should be able to speak clearly enough that their intent is obvious. It’s tempting to believe that there is some sort of intellectual barrier between you and the powerful — that the confusing and obtuse way that they speak is the sound of genius, rather than somebody who has learned a lot of smart-sounding words without ever learning what they mean. “But Ed, they’re trained to do this!” As someone who has media trained hundreds of people, there is only so much you can do to steer someone’s language. You cannot say to Sundar Pichai “hey man, can you sound more confusing?” You can, however, tell them what not to talk about and hope for the best. Sure, you can make them practice, sure, you can give them feedback, but people past a certain stage of power or popularity are going to talk however they want, and if they’re a big stupid idiot pretending to be smart, they’re going to sound exactly like this. Why? Because nobody in the media ever asks them to explain themselves. When you’ve spent your entire career being asked friendly-or-friendly-adjacent questions and never having someone say “wait, what does that mean?” you will continue to mutate in a pseudo-communicator that spits out information-adjacent bullshit. I am, to be clear, being very specific about that question. Powerful CEOs and founders never, ever get asked to explain what they’re saying, even when what they’re saying barely resembles an actual answer. Pichai, Altman and Nadella have always given this kind of empty-brained intellectual slop in response to questions because the media coddles them. These people are product managers and/or management consultants — and in Altman’s case, a savvy negotiator and manipulator known for “an absenteeism that rankled his peers and some of the startups he was supposed to nurture” as an investor at yCombinator, according to the Washington Post. By “coddle,” I mean these people are deliberately engaging in a combination of detective work and amnesia, where the reader or the listener is forced to simultaneously try and divine the meaning of their answer, while also not thinking too hard about the question the interviewer asked. Look at most modern business interviews. They involve a journalist asking a question, somebody giving an answer, and the journalist saying “okay!” and moving onto the next question, occasionally saying “but what about this?” when the appropriate response to many of the answers is to ask them to simplify them so that their meaning is clearer. A common response to all of this is to say that “interviewers can’t be antagonistic,” and I don’t think a lot of people understand what that means. It isn’t “antagonistic” to ask somebody to clearly articulate what they’re saying, nor is it “antagonistic” to say that you don’t understand, or that they didn’t answer the question you asked. If this is “antagonistic” to you, you are, intellectually-speaking, a giant fucking coward, because what you’re suggesting is that somebody cannot ask somebody to explain themselves, which is what an interview is. And I imagine nobody really wants to do this, because if you actually put these people on the spot, you’d realize the dark truth that I spoke of a few weeks ago: that the reason the powerful sound like idiots is because, well, they’re idiots. They sound like Business Idiots and create products to sell to Business Idiots, because Business Idiots run most companies and buy solutions based on what the last Business Idiot told them. To quote the excellent Nik Suresh: I know some of you might read this and say “these people can’t be stupid! These people run companies! They make huge deals! They read all these books!” and my answer is that some of the stupidest people I’ve ever met have read more books than you or I will read in a lifetime. While they might be smart when it comes to corporate chess moves or saying “this product category should do this,” none of these men — not Altman, Pichai or Nadella — actually has a hand in the design or creation of any of the things their companies make, and they never, ever have. Regardless, I have a larger point: it’s time to start mocking these people and tearing down their legends as geniuses of industry. They are not better than us, nor are they responsible for anything that their companies build other than the share price (which is a meaningless figure) and the accumulation of power and resources. These men are neither smart nor intellectually superior, and it’s time to start treating them as such. These people are powerful because they have names that are protected by the press. They are powerful because it is seen as unseemly to mock them because they are rich and “running a company,” a kind of corporate fealty that I find deeply unbecoming of an adult. We are, at most, customers. We do not “owe them” anything. We are long past the point when any of the people running these companies actually invented anything they sell. iIf anything, they owe us something, because they are selling us a product, even if said product is free and monetised by advertising. While reporters — as anyone — should have some degree of professionalism in interviews or covering subjects, there is no reason to treat these people as special, even if they have managed to raise a lot of money or their product is popular, because if that were the case we’d have far more coverage of defense contractor Lockheed Martin. It made $1.71 billion in profit last quarter, and hasn’t had a single quarter under a billion dollars in the last year. I’m being a little glib, but the logic behind covering OpenAI is, at this point, “it makes a lot of money and its product is popular,” which is also a fitting description of Lockheed Martin. The difference is that OpenAI has a consumer product that loses billions of dollars, and Lockheed Martin has products that makes billions of dollars by removing consumers from the Earth. Both of them are environmentally destructive. Covering OpenAI sure doesn’t seem to be about the tech, because if you looked at the tech you’d have to understand the tech, you’d see that the user numbers weren’t there outside of the 500 million people using ChatGPT, of which very few are actually paying for the product, and that the term “user” encompasses everything from the most occasional users who log in out of curiosity, to people who are actually using it as part of their daily lives. If covering OpenAI was about the tech, you’d read about how the tech itself doesn’t seem to have a ton of mass-market use cases, and those use cases aren’t really the kind of things that you’d pay for. If they did, there’d be articles that definitively discussed them versus articles in the New York Times about “everybody using AI” that boil down to “I use ChatGPT as search now” and “I heard a guy who asked it to teach him about modern art.” Yet men like Dario Amodei and Sam Altman continue to be elevated because they are “building the future,” even if they don’t seem to have built it yet, or have the ability to clearly articulate what that future actually looks like. Anthropic has now put out multiple stories suggesting that its generative AI will “blackmail” people as a means of stopping a user from turning off the system, something which is so obviously the company prompting its models to do so. Every member of the media covering this uncritically should feel ashamed of themselves. Sadly, this is all a result of the halo effect of being a Guy Who Raised Money or Guy Who Runs Big Company. We must, as human beings, assume that these people are smart, and that they’d never mislead us, because if we accept that they aren’t smart and that they willingly mislead us, we’d have to accept that the powerful are, well, bad and possibly unremarkable. And if they’re untrustworthy people that don’t seem that smart, we have to accept that the world is deeply unfair, and caters to people like them far more than it caters to people like us. We do not owe Satya Nadella any respect because he’s the CEO of Microsoft. If anything, we should show him outright scorn for the state of Microsoft products. Microsoft Teams is an insulting mess that only sometimes works, leaving workers spending 57% of their time either in Teams Chat, Teams Meetings or sending emails according to a Microsoft study. MSN.com is an abomination read by hundreds of millions of people a month, bloated with intrusive advertisements, attempts to trick you into downloading an app, and quasi-content that may or may not be AI generated. There are few products on the modern internet that show more contempt for the user -- other than, of course, Skype, a product that Microsoft let languish for more than a decade, the product so thoroughly engorged with spam that leaving it unattended for more than a month left you with a hundred unread messages from Eastern European romance scammers. Microsoft finally killed it in May. Products like Word and Excel don’t need improving, but that doesn’t stop Microsoft from trying, bloating them with odd user interface choices and forcing users to fight with popups to use an AI-powered Copilot that most of them hate. Why, exactly, are we meant to show these people respect? Because they run a company that provides a continually-disintegrating service? Because that service has such a powerful monopoly that it’s difficult to leave it if you’re interacting with other people or businesses? I think it’s because we live in Hell. The modern tech ecosystem is so utterly vile. Every single day our tech breaks in new and inventive ways, our iPhones resetting at random, random apps not accepting button presses, our Bluetooth disconnecting, our word processors harassing us to “try and use AI” while no longer offering us suggestions for typos, and our useful products replaced with useless shit, like how Google’s previously-functional assistants were replaced with generative AI that makes them tangibly worse so that Google can claim it has 350 million monthly active Gemini users. Yet the tech and business media acts as if everything is fine. It isn’t fine! It’s all really fucked! You can call me a cynic or a pessimist or every name under the sun, but the stakes have never been higher, and the damage never more wide-spread. Everything feels broken, and covering these companies as if it isn’t is insulting to your readers and your own intelligence. Look at the state of your computer or phone and tell me anything feels congruent or intentional rather than an endless battle of incentives. Look at the notifications on your phone and count the number of them that have absolutely nothing to do with information you actively need. As we speak, I have a notification from Adobe Lightroom, an app I use occasionally to edit photos, that tells me “Elevate any scene - now enhance people, sky, water and more with Quick Actions.” Zerocam, an app that brands itself “the first anti-AI camera app” where you “capture moments, not megapixels,” gave me a notification asking if I took a photo today. Amazon notified me that there is a deal picked just for me — a battery pack that I bought several months ago. Every single company that sends notifications like these should be mocked, but we have accepted such vile conditions as the norm. Apple should be tarred and feathered for allowing companies to send spam notifications, and yet it isn’t because, by and large, Apple is less vile and less exploitative than Microsoft, Google or Amazon. If you are reading this as a member of the tech press, seriously, please look at your daily experience with tech. Count the number of times that your day or a task is interrupted by poorly-designed software or hardware (such as the many, many times Zoom or Teams has a problem with Bluetooth, or a website just doesn’t load, or you type something into your browser and it just doesn’t do anything), or when the software you use either actively impedes you (hey, did you want to use AI? No? You sure?) or refuses to work in a logical way (see: Google Drive). There are tens of thousands of stories like this every day, and if you talked to people, you’d see how widespread it is…or maybe, I dunno, see that it’s happening to you too? There are people responsible, and the tech media writes about them every day. I realize it seems weird to constantly write that a company is releasing broken, convoluted software, but hey, if we can write 300,000 stories about how crime-ridden New York City is, why can’t we write three of them about how fucked Microsoft Office or Google Search have become? And why can’t we talk to the people in power about it? Is it because the questions are too hard to ask? Is it because it feels icky to interrupt Satya Nadella as he waffles on about using Copilot all the time by saying “hey man, Microsoft Teams is broken, tons of people feel this way, why?” or “why have you let MSN.com turn into a hub of AI slop and outright disinformation?” Oh no! You won’t get your access! Wahh! Who cares? Write a story about how Microsoft has become so unbelievably profitable as its products get worse, and talk about how weird and bad that is for the world! Ask Nadella those tough questions, or publish that Microsoft’s PR wouldn’t let you! These people are neither articulate nor wise, and whatever “intelligence” they may claim to have doesn’t seem to manifest in good products or intelligent statements. So why treat them like they’re smart? Why show them deference or pleasantries? These people have crapped up our digital lives at scale, and they deserve contempt, or at the very least a stern fucking reception. I realize I’m repeating points I’ve made again and again, but why is there such a halo around these fucking bozos? I’m serious! Why are we so protective of these guys? We’re more than happy to criticise celebrities, musicians, professional sports players, and politicians (fucking barely), but the business class is somehow protected outside of the occasional willingness to say that Elon Musk might have sort have done something wrong. I’m not denying there are critics. We have Molly White, Edward Ongweso Jr, Brian Merchant and — at a major outlet like CNN, no less! — one of the greatest living business writers in Allison Morrow. I believe that tech criticism is a barely-explored and hugely-profitable industry if we treated tech journalism less like the society pages and more like a force to hold the most powerful people in the world accountable as they continually harm billions of people in subtle ways. People are angry, and they aren’t stupid, and they want to see that anger reflected in the stories they read — and the meek deference we show to dumb fucking tech leaders is the opposite of that. As I’ve said before: we live in an era of digital tinnitus, nagged by notifications, warring with software ostensibly built for us that acts as if we’re the enemy. And if we’re the enemy, we should treat those building this software as the enemy in return. We are their customers, and they have failed us. The entire approach to business owners, especially in tech, is ridiculous. These people are selling us a product and the product fucking stinks! Put aside however you feel about generative AI for a second and face one very simple point: it doesn’t do enough, it’s really not cool at all, and we’re being forced to use it. I realize that some of you may want them to succeed, or want to be the person who tells everybody that they did so. I get that there are rewards for you — promotions, new positions, TV appearances repeating exactly what the powerful did and why they did it, or a plush role as that company’s head of communications — but I am telling you, your readers and viewers are waking up to it, and they feel like you have contempt for them and contempt for the truth. It’s easy — and common! — to try and dismiss my work as some sort of hater’s screed, a “cynical” approach to a tech industry that’s trying “brave new things” or whatever. In my opinion, there’s nothing more cynical than watching billions of people get shipped increasingly-shitty and expensive solutions and then get defensive of the people shipping them, and hostile to the people who are complaining that the products they use suck. I am angry at these companies because they have, at scale, torn down a tech industry that allowed me to be who I am today, and their intentional and disgraceful moves fill me full of disgust. I have watched the tech media move away from covering “technology” and more toward covering the people behind it, to the point that the actual outputs — the software and hardware we use every day — have taken a backseat to stories about whether Elon Musk does or doesn’t use a computer, which is meaningless, empty gossip journalism built to be shared by peers and nothing else. And please, please do not talk about optimism. If you are blindly saying that everything OpenAI does is cool and awesome and interesting, you aren’t being optimistic — you’re telling other people to be optimistic about a company’s success. It isn’t “optimistic” to believe that a company is going to build powerful AI despite it failing to do so. It’s propaganda, and yes, this is also the case if you simply don’t do the research to form a real opinion. I am not a pessimist because I criticize these companies, and framing me as one is cowardly and ignorant. If you are so weak-willed and speciously-informed that you can’t see somebody criticise a company without outright dismissing them as “a hater” or “pessimist,” you are an insult to journalism or analysis, and you know it in your wretched little heart. My heart sings with a firm belief in the things I think, founded on rigorous structures of knowledge that I’ve gained from reading things and talking to people, because something in me is incapable of being swayed by something just because everybody else is. You are assuming people are right because it is inconvenient and uncomfortable to accept they may not be, because doing so requires you to reckon with a market-wide hysteria founded on desperation and a lack of hyper-growth markets left in the tech industry. Worse still, in engaging with faux-optimism, you are failing to protect your readers and the general public. And if that’s what you want to do, ask yourself why! Why do you want these companies to win? What is it you want them to win? Do you want them to be rich? Do you want to be the person that told people they would be first? What is the world you want, and what does it look like, and how does doing your job in this way work toward creating that world? This isn’t optimism — it’s horse-trading, or strategic alignment behind powerful entities. It is choosing a side, because your side isn’t with the reader or the truth. If it was — even if you believed generative AI was powerful and that they simply didn’t understand — your duty would be to educate the reader in a clear-set and obvious way, and if you can’t find a way to do so, acknowledging that and explaining why. True optimism requires you to have a deep, meaningful understanding of things so that you can engage in real hope — a magical feeling, one that can buoy you in the most challenging times. What many claim is “optimism” is actually blind faith, the likes of which you’ll see at a roulette table. Or, of course, knowingly peddling propaganda. Let’s even take a different tact: say you actually want these companies to “build powerful AI,” and believe they’re smart enough to do so. Say that, somehow, looking at their decaying finances, the lack of revenue, the lack of growth, and the remarkable lack of use cases, you still come out of it saying “sure, I think they’re going to do this!” How? Why haven’t they done it yet? Why, three years in, are we still unable to describe what ChatGPT actually does, and why we need it? Take away how much money OpenAI makes for a second (and, indeed, how much it loses). Does this product actually really inspire anything in you? What is it that’s magical about this? And, on a business level, what is it I’m meant to be impressed by, exactly? OpenAI has — allegedly — hit “$10 billion in annualized revenue” (essentially the biggest month it can find, multiplied by 12), which is…not that much, really, considering it’s the most prominent company in the software world, with the biggest brand, and with the attention of the entirety of the world’s media. It has, allegedly, 500 million weekly active users — and, by the last count, only 15.5 million paying subscribers, an absolutely putrid conversion rate even before you realize that the actual conversion rate would be monthly active subscribers. That’s how any real software company actually defines its metrics, by the fucking way. Why is this impressive? Because it grew fast? It literally had more PR and more marketing and more attention and more opportunities to sell to more people than any company has ever had in the history of anything. Every single industry has been told to think about AI for three years, and they’ve been told to do so because of a company called OpenAI. There isn’t a single god damn product since Google or Facebook that has had this level of media pressure, and both of those companies launched without the massive amount of media (and social media) that we have today. Having literally everybody talking about your product all the time for years is pretty useful! Why isn’t it making more money? Why are we taking any of these people seriously? Mark Zuckerberg paid $14.3 billion for Scale AI, an AI data company, as a means of hiring its CEO Alexandr Wang to run his “superintelligence” team, has been offering random OpenAI employees $100 million to join Meta, thought about buying both AI search company Perplexity and generative video company Runway and even tried to buy OpenAI co-founder Ilya Sutskever’s pre-product “$32bn valuation” non-company Safe Superintelligence, settling instead on hiring its CEO Daniel Gross and buying his venture fund for some fucking reason. When you put aside the big numbers, these are the actions of a desperate dimwit with a failing product trying to buy his way to making generative AI into a “superintelligence,” something that Meta’s own Chief AI scientist Yan LeCun says isn’t going to work. By assuming that there is some sort of grand strategy behind these moves beyond “if we get enough smart people together something will happen,” you help boost the powerful’s messaging and buoy their stock valuations. You are not educating anybody by humouring these goofballs. In fact, the right way to approach this would be to ask why Meta, a multi-trillion dollar market cap company with a near-monopoly over all social media, is spending billions of dollars in what appears to be a totally irresponsible way. Instead, people are suggesting this is Mark Zuckerberg’s genius at work. Anyway, putting that aside, what exactly is the impressive part of generative AI again? The fucking code? Enough about the code, I’m tired of hearing about the code, I swear to god you people think that being a software engineer is only coding and that it’s fine if you ship “mediocre code,” as if bad code can’t bring down entire organizations. What do you think a software engineer does? Is all they do code? If you think the answer is yes, you are wrong! Human beings may make mistakes in writing code, but they at least know what a mistake looks like, which a generative AI does not, because a generative AI doesn’t know what anything is, or anything at all, because it is a probabilistic model. Congratulations! You made another way in which software engineers can automate parts of their jobs — stop being so fucking excited about the idea that people are going to lose their livelihoods! It’s nasty, and founded on absolutely nothing other than your adulation for the powerful! These models are dangerous and chaotic, built with little intention or regard for the future, just like the rest of big tech’s products. ChatGPT would’ve been a much smaller deal if Google had any interest in turning Google Search into a product that truly answered a query (as opposed to generating more of them to show more impressions to advertisers) — a nuanced search engine that took a user’s query and spat out a series of websites that might help answer said question rather than just summarising a few of them for an answer. And if you ever need proof that Google just doesn’t know how to fucking innovate anymore, look at AI Summaries, a product that both misunderstands search and why people use ChatGPT as a search replacement. While OpenAI may “summarise” stuff to give an answer, it at the very least gives something approximating a true answer, rather than a summary that feels like an absentee parent trying to get rid of you and then throwing you $20 in the hopes you’ll leave them alone. If Google Search truly evolved, ChatGPT wouldn’t really matter, because the idea of a machine that can theoretically answer a question is kind of why people used fucking Google in the fucking first place. Again, why are we not describing this company as the business equivalent of a banana republic? It’s actively making its shit worse to juice growth, and it’s really obvious how badly it sucks. Why doesn’t the state of Google dominate tech news, just like how random ketamine-fuelled tweets from Elon Musk do? Why aren’t we, collectively, repulsed by Google as a company? Why aren’t we, collectively, repulsed by OpenAI? No matter how big ChatGPT is, the fact that there’s a product out there with hundreds of millions of users that constantly gets answers wrong is a genuinely worrying thing for society, and that’s before you get to the environmental damage, the fact it trained its models on millions of people’s art and writing, and oh, I dunno, the fact it plans to lose over a hundred billions of dollars before becoming profitable? Why are we not more horrified? Why are we not more forlorn that this is where hundreds of billions of dollars are being forced? The most prominent company in the tech industry is an unstable monolith with a vague product that can only make $10 billion a year (revenue, not profit) as the very fabric of its existence is shoved down the throat of every executive in the world at once. Also, if it’s not fed $20 billion to $40 billion a year, it will die. Give me a fucking break. I don’t know, I sound pretty ornery, I get accused of being a hater or missing the grand mystery of this bullshit every few minutes by somebody with an AI avatar of a guy who looks like he’s banned from multiple branches of Best Buy, I understand there’s things that people do with Large Language Models, I am aware, but none of it matters because the way they’re being discussed is like we’re two steps from digitally replacing hundreds of millions of people. The reality is far simpler: we have an industry that has spent nearly half a trillion dollars between its capital expenditures and venture capital funding to create another industry with the combined revenue of the fucking smartwatch industry. What I’m writing isn’t inflammatory — in fact, it’s far more deeply rooted in reality than those claiming that OpenAI is building the future. Let’s do some fucking mathematics! Projected Big Tech Capital Expenditures in 2025 and revenue from AI: That’s $327 billion this year, with a total revenue of…what, $18 billion of revenue? And that’s not profit! And that’s if we include OpenAI’s spend on Azure. Even if every single one of these companies was making $18 billion in revenue a year from this it wouldn’t be great, but it’s more than likely that these chunderfucks can’t even pull together the projected revenue ($32 billion) of the global smartwatch industry! What a joke! “Wuhh, but what about OpenAI?” What about OpenAI? I’ve written about this so much. So what, OpenAI makes $12.7 billion this year, but loses $14 billion, what does that mean to you, exactly? What’re you going to say? The cost of inference is coming down? No, the cost that people are being charged is going down, we have no firm data on the actual costs because the companies don’t want to talk about it, and yes, it will absolutely lower prices to compete with other companies. The Information just reported that OpenAI was doing this to compete with Microsoft last week! Hey, quick question — wasn’t SoftBank meant to spend $3 billion annually on OpenAI’s software? Did that happen? Anyway, even if we add OpenAI’s revenue to the pot, we are at $30.7 billion. If we add the supposed $1 billion in revenue from training data startup Surge, $300 million in “annualized revenue” from Turing, optimistically assume that Perplexity will have $100 million (up from $34 million in 2024, where it burned $65 million) in revenue in 2025, and assume that Anysphere’s (which makes Cursor) $200 million run rate stays consistent through 2025, we are at…$32.3 billion. But I'm not being fair, am I? I didn’t include many of the names from The Information’s generative AI database. Prepare yourself, this is gonna be annoying! So let's add some more. We’ve got $3 billion from Anthropic, $870 million from Scale (now part of Meta), another alleged $300 million for Anysphere (The Information claims $500 million in ARR), we consider Neo4j’s “>$200 million ARR” to mean “$200 million,” Midjourney’s “>$200 million ARR” to mean $200m, Ironclad’s “>$150 million ARR” to mean $150 million ARR, Glean’s $103 million ARR, Together AI’s $100 million ARR, Moveworks’ $100 million ARR, Abridge’s $100 million ARR, Synthesia’s $100 million ARR, WEKA’s “>$100 million ARR” to mean $100m ARR, Windsurf’s $100m ARR, Runway’s $84 million ARR, Elevenlabs’ “>$100m ARR” to mean $100m ARR, Cohere’s $70m ARR, Jasper’s “>$60m ARR” to mean $60m, Harvey’s $50m ARR, Ada’s “>$50m ARR” to mean $50m, Photoroom’s $50m ARR…and then assumed the combined ARR of the remainders are somewhere in the region of a very generous $200m, we get… Less than $39 billion dollars of total revenue in the entire generative AI industry. Jesus fucking christ! According to The Information, generative AI companies have raised more than $18.8 billion in the first quarter of 2025, after investing $21 billion in Q4 2024 and $4 billion in Q3 2024 for a grand total of $43.8 billion, or a total of $370.8 billion of investment and capital expenditures for an industry that, despite being the single-most talked about thing on the planet, cannot even create a tenth of the dollars it requires to make it work. These companies are predominantly unprofitable, perpetually searching for product-market fit, and even when they find it, seem incapable of generating revenue numbers that remotely justify their valuations. If I’m honest, I think the truly radical position here is the one taken by most tech reporters that would rather take the lazy position of “well Uber lost a lot of money!” than think for two seconds about whether we’re all being sold a line of shit. What we’re watching is a mountain of waste perpetuated by the least-charming failsons of our generation. Nobody should be giving Satya Nadella or Sam Altman a glossy profile — they should be asking direct, brutal questions, much like Joanna Stern just did of Apple’s Craig Federighi, who had absolutely fucking nothing to share because he has never been pushed like this. Put aside the money for a second and be honest: these men are pathetic, unimpressive, uninventive, and dreadfully, dreadfully boring. Anthropic’s Wario (Sorry, Dario) Amodei and OpenAI’s Sam Altman have far more in common with televangelist Joel Olstein than they’ll ever have with Steve Jobs or any number of people that have actually invented things, and they got that way because we took them seriously instead of saying “wait, what do you mean?” To a single one of their wrongheaded, oafish and dim-witted hype-burps. It’s boring! I’m terribly, horribly bored, and if you’re interested in this shit I am genuinely curious why, especially if you’re a reporter, because right now the “innovation” happening in AI is, at best, further mutations of the Software As A Service business model, providing far less value than previous innovations at a calamitous cost. Reasoning models don’t even reason, as proven by an Apple paper released a few weeks ago, and agents as a concept are fucked because large language models are inherently unreliable — and yes, a study out of fucking Salesforce found that agents began to break down when given multi-step tasks, such as “any task you’d want to have an agent automate.” So, here’s my radical suggestion: start making fun of these people. They are not charming. They are not building anything. They have scooted along amassing billions of dollars promising the world and delivering you a hill of dirt. They deserve our derision — or, at the very least, our deep, unerring suspicion, if not for what they’ve done, but for what they’ve not done. Sam Altman is nowhere near delivering a functioning agent, let alone anything approaching intelligence, and really only has one skill: making other companies risk a bunch of money on his stupid ideas. No, really! He convinced Oracle to buy $40 billion of NVIDIA chips to put in the Abilene Texas “Stargate” data center, despite the fact that the Stargate organization has yet to be formed (as reported by The Information). SoftBank and Microsoft pay all of OpenAI’s bills, and the media does his marketing for him. OpenAI is, as I said, quite literally a banana republic. It requires the media and the markets to make up why it has to exist, it requires other companies to pump it full of money and build its infrastructure, and it doesn’t even make products that matter, with Sam Altman constantly talking about all the exciting shit other people will build. You can keep honking about how “it built the API that will power the future,” but if that’s the case, where’s the fucking future, exactly? Where is it? What am I looking at here? Where’s the economic activity? Where’s the productivity? The returns suck! The costs are too high! Why am I the radical person for saying this? This entire situation is absolutely god damn ridiculous, an incomparable waste even if it somehow went in the green. For the horrendous amounts of capital invested in generative AI to make sense, the industry would have to have revenue that dwarfed the smartphone and enterprise SaaS market combined, rather than less than half of that of the mobile gaming industry. Satya Nadella, Sam Altman, Wario Amodei, Tim Cook, Andy Jassy — they deserve to be laughed at, mocked, or at the very least interrogated vigorously, because their combined might has produced no exciting or interesting products outside of, at best, what will amount to a productivity upgrade for integrated development environments and faster ways to throw out code that may or may not be reliable. These things aren’t nothing, but they’re nowhere near the something that we’re being promised. So I put it to you, dear reader: why are we taking them seriously? What is there to take seriously other than their ability to force stuff on people? And I’ll leave you with a question: how do they manage to keep doing this, exactly? They always seem to find new growth, every single quarter, without fail? Is it because they keep coming up with new ideas? Or is it because they come up with new ideas to get more money, a vastly different choice that involves increasing the prices of products or making them worse so that they can show you more advertisements. My positions are not radical, and if you believe they are, your deference to the powerful disgusts me. In any case, I want to end this with something inspirational, because I believe that things change when regular people feel stronger and more capable. I want you to know that you are fully capable of understanding all of this. I don’t care if you “aren’t a numbers person” or “don’t get business.’ I don’t have a single iota of economics training, and everything you’ve ever read me write has been something I’ve had to learn. I was a layperson right up until I learned the stuff, then I became a stuff-knower, just like you can be. The tech industry, the finance industry, the entire mechanisms of capitalism want you to believe that everything they do is magical and complex, when it’s all far more obvious than you’d believe. You don’t have to understand the entire fundamentals of finance to know how venture capital works — they buy percentages of companies at a valuation that they hope is much lower than the company would be worth in the future. You don’t need to be technical to know that Large Language Models generate a response based on billions of pieces of training data, and by guessing at what the next bit of text in a line should be based on what it’s seen previously. These people love to say “ah, but didn’t you see-” and present an anecdote, when no anecdote will ever defeat the basics of “your business doesn’t make any money, the software doesn’t do the things you claim it’s meant to, and you have no path to profitability.” They can yammer at you all they want about “lots of people using ChatGPT,” but that doesn’t change the fact that ChatGPT just isn’t that revolutionary, and their only play here is to make you feel stupid rather than actually showing you why it’s so fucking revolutionary. This is the argument of a manipulator and a coward, and you are above such things. You don’t really have to be a specialist in anything to pry this shit apart, which is why so much of my work is either engaging to those who learn something from it or frustrating to those that intentionally deceive others through gobbledygook hype-schpiel. I will sit here and explain every fucking part of this horrid chain of freaks, and break it down into whatever pieces it takes to educate as many people as I have to to make things change. I also must be clear that I am nobody. I started writing this newsletter with 300 subscribers and no reason other than the fact I wanted to, and four years later I have nearly 64,000 subscribers and an award-winning podcast. I have no economics training, no special access, no deep sources, just the ability to look at things that are happening and say stuff. I taught myself everything I know about this industry, and there is nothing stopping you from doing the same. I was convinced I was stupid until around two years ago, though if I’m honest it might have been last year. I have felt othered the majority of my life, convinced by people that I am incapable or unwelcome, and as I’ve become more articulate and confident in who I am and what I believe in, I have noticed that the only people that seek to degrade or suppress are those of weak minds and weaker wills — Business Idiots in different forms and flavors. I have learned to accept who I am — that I am not like most people — and people conflate my passion and vigor with anger or hate, when what they’re experiencing is somebody different who deeply resents what the powerful have done to the computer. And while I complain about the state of media, what I’ve seen in the last year is that there are many, many people like me — both readers and peers — that resent things in the same way. I conflated being different with being alone, and I couldn’t be more wrong. For those of you that don’t wish to lick the boots of the people fucking up every tech product, the tent is large, it’s a big club, and you’re absolutely in it. A better tech industry is one where the people writing about it hold it accountable, pushing it toward creating the experiences and connectivity that truly change the world rather than repeating and reinforcing the status quo. Don’t watch the mouth, watch the hands. These companies will tell you that they’re amazing as many times as they want, but you don’t need to prove that — they do. I don’t care if you tell a single human soul about my work, but if it helps you understand these people better, use it to teach other people. These people may seem all-powerful, but they’ve built the Rot Economy on a combination of anonymity and a placant press, but pressure against them starts with you and those you know understanding how their businesses work, and trusting that you can understand because you absolutely can. Millions of people understanding how these people run their companies and how poorly they’ve built their software will stop people like Sundar Pichai from being able to quietly burn Google Search to the ground. People like Sam Altman are gambling that you are easily-confused, easily-defeated and incurious, when you could be writing thousands of words on a newsletter that you never, ever edit for brevity. You can understand every fucking part of their business — the economics of OpenAI, the flimsy promises of Salesforce, the destruction of Google Search — and you can tell everybody you know about it, and suddenly it won’t be so easy for these wretched creeps to continue thriving. I know it sounds small, and like your role is even smaller, but the reason they’ve grown so rapaciously is driven by the sense that the work they do is some sort of black magic, when it’s really fucking stupid and boring finance stapled onto a tech industry that’s run out of ideas. You are more than capable of understanding this entire world — including the technology, along with the finances that ultimately decide what technology gets made next. These people have got rich and famous and escaped all blame by casting themselves as somehow above us, when if I’m honest, I’ve never looked down on somebody quite as much as I do the current gaggle of management consultant fucks that have driven Silicon Valley into the ground.

Title: Apple Reportedly Has Numerous XR Headsets & Glasses Coming Between Now & 2028

Time Published: 2025-06-30T14:49:39Z
Full Content:
Independent tech analyst Ming-Chi Kuo reports that Apple’s XR and smart glasses roadmap will feature multiple XR devices, including a spec-bumped Vision Pro slated to release later this year. At the far end of the spectrum, Kuo also says Apple is making AR glasses, reportedly coming in 2028. Kuo is a long-time tech analyst and respected figure in Apple product leaks. In a new blogpost, Kuo has laid out a timeline for a number of Apple XR releases, ostensibly based on various supply chain leaks. Kuo reports that a new Vision Pro featuring the company’s M5 chip is scheduled for mass production in Q3 2025, with 150,000–200,000 units expected to ship. This next Vision Pro is reportedly upgrading the chip from M2 to M5, but will otherwise retain the original specs. Kuo maintains the iterative approach is based on Vision Pro’s current position as a niche product, as the company hopes to use the next version to maintain market presence, reduce component stock, and further refine XR applications. Next, Kuo says Apple is preparing a much lighter headset, reportedly called ‘Vision Air’, set to release in Q3 2027. Vision Air is said to be dramatically lighter at over 40% less than the current Vision Pro, which weighs in at 21.2–22.9 ounces (600–650 g), excluding the battery. Kuo maintains Vision Air will include plastic lenses, magnesium alloys, fewer sensors, a top-tier iPhone chip, and be priced significantly lower to appeal to broader users. The true next-gen Vision device is said to be ‘Vision Pro 2’ though, which Kuo says could arrive in 2H 2028, replete with a full redesign, Mac-grade chip, reduced weight, and a lower price, signaling Apple’s shift to move away from niche XR products and move toward mainstream adoption. Meanwhile, Kuo says Apple is investing heavily in smart glasses. A Ray-Ban-like, audio-first wearable is expected to arrive in Q2 2027, Kuo says, noting that the company is hoping to manufacture 3–5 million units—ostensibly a significant push towards making its first smart glasses a mainstream success. Like Ray-Ban Meta, and the recently unveiled Oakley Meta HSTN, Apple’s smart glasses are said to have no display, rather offering audio playback, photo and video capture, an AI assistant, and both gesture and voice controls. Arguably the biggest claim among Kuo’s timeline is the mention of Apple XR Glasses, which the analyst maintains will include a color display (LCoS + waveguide) and AI features, making it the first true AR glasses from the company. Kuo says Apple is targeting release in 2H 2028, with a lighter variant being developed in parallel. This follows reports of Apple potentially scraping a more casual XR glasses-type viewer, which would be tethered to Apple devices and use birdbath optics. The device was originally planned for release in Q2 2026, but Kuo maintains it was paused in late 2024 due to insufficient differentiation, especially around weight. Granted, Apple is one of the most opaque black boxes in tech for a reason. The company historically announces products on stage, which typically also comes with a price and release date attached. While Kuo has a fairly reliable track record of reporting insider knowledge of Vision Pro, we’re taking this data dump with an equally-sized grain of salt. This article may contain affiliate links. If you click an affiliate link and buy a product we may receive a small commission which helps support the publication. More information. Low specced, high-priced and served with plenty of Kool Aid. Some premium iPhones can't even run AI due to Apple's stingy memory. But they're the best and most excellently optimised things ever. Except when it comes to future proofing. Give me Samsung and similar any day. We owe a huge debt to Apple as regards smartphone evolution, but they're like your dad on the sofa now, wearing a jumper and watching Bowls. The minimum requirement for using Apple AI is an A17 Pro or A18, which double the NPU performance from ~16/17 TOPS on A15/A16 to 35 TOPS. All iPhones using the A17 Pro/A18 also come with 8GB of RAM compared to 6GB before, so you can run Apple AI on iPhone Pro/Plus from 2023 or all iPhones from 2024 or later. But it's not just the RAM that's the issue here. After years of annoyingly keeping the basic Mac configuration at 8GB, Apple now switched everything to at least 16GB esp. to be able to run Apple AI, so the stingy memory policy and obscene upgrade prices certainly play a part. But a lot of people using basic M1 MacBooks with 8GB RAM from late 2020 still see no reason to upgrade, because the speed is fine, and thanks to very fast SSDs and clever MacOS memory management, these 8GB will get you a lot further than on a Windows laptop. Just not for AI, which needs very fast access to gigabytes large models, with swapping not an option. So these users won't get Apple AI, which many consider a feature instead of a bug. And usually Apple devices get a lot longer support than anything Android, which may count for "future proofing". No doubt they are low specced, high-priced and served with plenty of Kool Aid. But as Apple controls the OS, the specs are typically well balanced for the majority of users. And even the most basic configuration will usually work just fine for at least half a decade with continued OS updates, though you might not get all of the latest features, and even longer security updates. TL;DR: 2025 M5 Vision Pro with the same issues, but more speed, for the enterprise market; 2027 A21 Vision Air for consumers, addressing the comfort/price issues, but otherwise offering the same experience as the current M2 AVP. A Vision Air makes a lot of sense, as it addresses high weight and price, which are the main issues most reviewers had/have with the AVP. By now Apple has learned how people use AVP, and can try to achieve the same experience with less/newer hardware. The M- and A-Series chips use the same types of cores, just in different configurations, with A-chips designed for low power mobile. By 2027 the M2 will be five years old, so a high end A-SoC should be faster, allowing for the same experience as the M2 AVP, but with less power/money/weight. And by reducing the huge amount of sensors to what is essential, they may be able to drop the extra R1 signal processor that works in parallel to the M2 in AVP. A more difficult question is who the M5 update is for. It not a redesign, mostly a SoC replacement with maybe some minor changes, similar to Pico 4 Ultra compared to Pico 4. But all it effectively does is bump up the speed, and this is the one area where AVP hasn't been widely criticized. Price/weight/power consumption/comfort all stay the same and will only be addressed by the Vision Air. So from a consumer perspective, they might as well have continued to sell the M2 AVP until the Air arrives. My guess is that this upgrade is mostly about pushing AVP for enterprise use instead of the consumer market. With no apps demanding it, regular customers won't really benefit from the extra power, but a large company running their own custom software might. Earlier this months Apple showed a couple of new features of visionOS 26, one of which was co-located AR, allowing several people using AVP in the same physical space to work together on virtual objects. This was demonstrated with Dassault Systèmes, who are a heavy weight in the aerospace CAD and simulation market and offer a number of compute-heavy engineering solutions. That's the type of software companies buy expensive workstation hardware for, and they most certainly would love every bit of speed they can get, money/power/weight be damned. If this is what Apple is going for, the next Apple Vision most XR users will care about will arrive in 2027 and no longer bear the "Pro" label. And what is released later this year will take the Pro more serious and explicitly target the enterprise market. Apple has done silent updates before, upping the specs without an actual product instructions, just offering a short press release. And if the M5 AVP is indeed aimed at the professional market, "the company historically announces products on stage, which typically also comes with a price and release date attached" may not apply here. So maybe don't expect any big announcement for later this year, or (mis-)interpret a lack of such announcements as Apple pulling back from XR. Excellent analysis and summary. I do think there will be more than just an M2-M5 upgrade. There are simple things Apple can do around the headstrap design (too heavy on the bridge of your nose/face) and upgraded battery. I do agree it will have more enterprise features (and would expect some partnership announcements with the big MDM players. I also think they will introduce multi-user device sharing. Technically visionOS is based on iPadOS, which has multi-user profile functionality, but ONLY for MDM users like schools or companies. So it would make sense to also introduce it for AVP as an enterprise feature, as it most likely existed in the OS from day one. Just not for regular consumer peasants. I'm somewhat pessimistic regarding other hardware changes though, mostly because Kuo said that "the company hopes to use the next version to maintain market presence, reduce component stock, and further refine XR applications." We knew right from the beginning that AVP production was limited by Sony microOLED availability to at most 450K units per year. But they sold even less, apparently a lot less than they expected, and some time ago told their manufacturers to stop producing new components, planing to sell off existing stock until a successor arrives. So they may be sitting on a large pile of sensors, displays, cases and head straps not yet used, making them reluctant to offer some easy to achieve improvements. The estimated 150K-200K (per year/total?) M5 AVP units may all use mostly components they already ordered for the original AVP, with only the SoC being replaced. They could have stockpiled a few hundred thousands of these too, but AVP is now the last Apple device sold still using M2, everything else has been moved to a newer generation, which may be another reason for the upgrade besides more power for enterprise users. Ok, if the guy is right that’s getting ridiculous… …3 more years to have a true successor to AVP. It better go directly 8k per eye, holographic lenses with varifocal and weigh less than 150g by then because that’s next century in nerd years. And 40 percent lighter for a vision air with plastic lenses in 2 years, that’s pathetic both in terms of specs (still way too heavy) and way too late.. Apple is really a company falling apart. There is no excitement with them, since cook took over, it’s as dull as an insurance company. Yes, Tim Cook is for Apple what Bob Iger is for Disney. Profit and wokeness, but no soul. So for the 2027 Quest 4, we hope for 2.5K/3.5K microOLED, better passthrough, eye tracking, and XR2 Gen 3 with ~2.8x the graphics performance of the 2023 Quest 3, at roughly the same size/weight. And if Apple, who's 2024 AVP already offers 3.5K microOLEDs, excellent passthrough, eye tracking and ~50% more raw GPU performance than Quest 3, doesn't manage to one year after Quest 4 release an AVP2 that offers tech that doesn't even work as prototypes yet, at less than 1/3rd the weight of Quest 3, and technically completely unfeasible for anybody else, they are falling apart, because they are as dull as an insurance company. In the last 20 years, Apple has invented nothing but iPhones. – Always faster iPhones, sometimes a bit bigger, sometimes a bit smaller – Very small iPhones with a strap (iWatch) – Very large iPhones (iPad) – iPhones you can strap to your face (Apple Vision Pro) – Large foldable iPhones with a keyboard (MacBook Air) Oh yes, and of course AirPods too! Innovation looks different than constantly just varying the same theme.

Title: Differentiating bacteria by their unique surface interactions

New, rapid, and accessible approaches to bacterial detection are necessary to help curb the rising impacts of antimicrobial resistance. In this study, we introduce a technique that distinguishes bacteria through their unique surface interactions. By measuring and combining the interaction strengths of a bacterium across a set of chemically defined surfaces, we produced a novel bacterial identifier termed the surface interaction profile (SIP). The interaction strengths of twelve test bacteria across three discrete polyelectrolyte multilayer films (PEMs) were measured, facilitated by introducing each bacterial suspension to individual PEMs in microfluidic channels over a 10-minute interaction period and rinsing to remove bulk and loosely bound bacteria. The remaining surface-bound cells were counted via microscopy and plotted against suspension concentrations to build attachment curves whose slopes were measured as the strength of interaction for a given bacteria-PEM combination. These slopes were collected, per bacterial type, to produce each SIP. SIPs were capable of distinguishing between our pathogenic strains (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus) by Gram stain and individual species, and each blind test pathogen was successfully identified through SIP comparison. Furthermore, SIPs were also successful at differentiating between select Staphylococcus aureus walKR mutants impacting cell wall metabolism and high-risk antibiotic resistance mutants (MRSA and VISA), highlighting the utility and future diagnostic potential of this technique.

Competing interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. Rapid bacterial diagnostics are essential in the global response to rising antimicrobial resistance (AMR). In principle, improving the turnaround time for bacterial identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST) enables doctors to quickly prescribe effective antibiotics, improving patient outcomes while reducing the overuse and misuse of antibiotics that contribute to the further breeding of resistance [1,2]. In practice, traditional approaches (e.g., culture-based, phenotypic, turbidimetric) and improved or emerging rapid techniques (e.g., nucleic acid amplification tests, mass spectrometry, enhanced turbidity) are either significantly time-consuming or resource-intensive [3]. Furthermore, emerging technologies are limited in their routine use and implementation in low-resource settings due to significant cost and operational barriers [4,5]. A chorus of risk factors, including limited access to clean water and sanitation, poor infection control practices in healthcare facilities, and a lack of antibiotic stewardship, increase the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant infections, associated mortality rates and healthcare costs in developing countries [6,7]. Continued progress toward new, rapid, and accessible approaches to pathogen detection is necessary to curb the global impact of AMR by improving diagnostics and infection surveillance practices beyond our borders. This study introduces a novel technique that differentiates bacteria based on their surface interactions, with the aim of developing a more rapid and less resource-intensive bacterial diagnostic. Variability in bacterial surface composition is observed across classes of bacteria, from broader differences between Gram stain and species to more subtle differences between strains and individual mutants, which impact the expression of virulence factors and/or antibiotic resistance [8–13]. Their unique surface composition and chemistry directly influence how they interact with surfaces [14,15], including those in their natural environments. The early stages of attachment are facilitated predominantly by electrostatics and, to a lesser extent, van der Waals forces and hydrophobic interactions [16–18]. In this context, the bacterial surface becomes a viable, versatile target for detection, offering a broad spectrum of potential surface interactions that can be utilized to differentiate between a wide array of bacteria. The attachment of bacterium A and B to an identical substrate C may not yield a measurable difference in their interaction strengths to differentiate them, primarily due to the small pool of possible interactions available when using a single substrate as a probe. Increasing the number and chemical diversity of substrates for which interaction strengths are measured enhances the capacity and complexity of potential interactions used to differentiate. In principle, this would allow for more nuanced variations in surface composition to be detectable, improving the probability of distinguishing bacterium A from B while also expanding the potential utility beyond species- or strain-level identification. By integrating interaction strengths across multiple chemically distinct surfaces we generate a unique bacterial identifier, the surface interaction profile (SIP) (Fig 1), designed to differentiate bacteria by direct comparison and to identify a clinical pathogen causing infection through comparison across a library of pre-measured SIPs. a, A schematic depicting the SIP, a novel bacterial identifier produced by combining interaction strengths between a given bacterium and a series of chemically unique surfaces. b, An illustration of a polyelectrolyte multilayer film assembled via the layer-by-layer approach. c-e, The chemical structures of polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride (PDDA), polystyrene sulfonate (PSS), and polyethylenamine (PEI). f, A schematic of six test PEM surfaces (grey circles) encased in microfluidic channels (squares) in a polystyrene Petri dish. g, The protocol for bacterial-surface interactions: (1) pre-soaking PEM with PBS buffer (30 min), (2) introducing bacterial suspensions to each channel, (3) leaving them in contact for 10 minutes, and (4) rinsing channels with PBS. a, A schematic depicting the SIP, a novel bacterial identifier produced by combining interaction strengths between a given bacterium and a series of chemically unique surfaces. b, An illustration of a polyelectrolyte multilayer film assembled via the layer-by-layer approach. c-e, The chemical structures of polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride (PDDA), polystyrene sulfonate (PSS), and polyethylenamine (PEI). f, A schematic of six test PEM surfaces (grey circles) encased in microfluidic channels (squares) in a polystyrene Petri dish. g, The protocol for bacterial-surface interactions: (1) pre-soaking PEM with PBS buffer (30 min), (2) introducing bacterial suspensions to each channel, (3) leaving them in contact for 10 minutes, and (4) rinsing channels with PBS. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0327489.g001 To test the distinguishing power of SIPs, we quantified the surface interaction strengths of twelve test bacteria across three discrete, chemically distinct polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) films (Fig 1b) topped with the following positive- and negative-charged polymers: poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (PDDA) (Fig 1c), polystyrene sulfonate (PSS) (Fig 1d), and polyethylenimine (PEI) (Fig 1e). All PEMs were encased in individual microfluidic channels (Fig 1f) and were exposed to four serially diluted bacterial suspensions (prepared via three biological replicates) through the following steps (Fig 1g): (1) pre-soaking the PEMs, (2) introducing bacterial suspensions to the channels, (3) leaving them in contact for 10 minutes, and (4) removing excess and loosely bound cells via rinsing. The remaining surface-attached bacteria were counted via optical microscopy and plotted against all suspension concentrations to build attachment curves (S1 Fig). Their slopes represented the interaction strength values for each bacterial-PEM combination and were collected (per bacterium) to produce each SIP (Fig 1g). A set of pathogens responsible for the majority of nosocomial infections [19] was tested to compare SIPs of bacteria broadly by Gram stain and individual species, including a blind experiment. This was followed by comparing SIPs across Staphylococcus aureus mutants affecting cell wall metabolism and antibiotic resistance (including single- and multi-drug-resistant mutants). The stock solutions (10 mg/mL) for polydiallyldimethylammonium chloride (PDDA) (Aldrich, 208.00 mg/mL, Mw 100,000–200,000), polyethylenimine (PEI) (Aldrich, 50% wt, Mw 750,000), and polystyrene sulfonate (PSS) (Aldrich, 344.13 mg/mL, Mw 200,000) polyelectrolytes were prepared by weight and dissolved in deionized (DI) water (pH 6.998, Millipore Milli-Q) with magnetic stirring. Three working polymer solutions (1 mg/mL) for each polymer type were prepared by diluting each respective stock (x10) with DI water and were sonicated (10 minutes) prior to use. Using a template (S3 Fig a), thirty-six small circles (1 cm diameter) were drawn across the interior of six Petri dish lids that formed the perimeter of each individual PEM surface. Three polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) type surfaces were prepared via the layer-by-layer approach with the following combinations of positive and negative polymer layers: PDDA/PSS (5.5 bilayer, positively charged PDDA-topped PEM), PDDA/PSS (5 bilayer, negatively charged PSS-topped PEM), and PEI/PSS (5.5 bilayer, positively charged PEI-topped PEM). To begin, a small aliquot (100 µL) of the positively charged polymer was added to each marked circle: PDDA (1 mg/mL) for PDDA- (N = 12) and PSS-topped (N = 12) PEMs, and PEI (1 mg/mL) for the PEI-topped PEM surfaces (N = 12). Once the positive polymer solution was added to each circle (N = 36), they were left to interact for 1 minute. After the interaction period, each individual surface was rinsed from top to bottom (unidirectional flow) in the order that the polymer was added (~2 seconds duration per surface) with a light stream of DI water: the rinsing protocol is detailed in S4 Fig. With a single Petri lid held at an approximately 35˚ angle (a), three of six surfaces were rinsed individually from left to right (b) with the DI water waste collecting at the bottom lip of the lid. The lid was then rotated counterclockwise by 180˚ (c), maintaining its angled position and allowing the excess water to flow around the lid edge. The final three surfaces were rinsed from above in the same order (left to right) as above (d), and the accumulated DI water was subsequently poured out (e). The lids were then flipped upside down and firmly tapped eight times against three piled Kimwipes on the lab bench, removing excess DI water without contacting the PEMs (f). This process was repeated for all remaining surfaces. A small aliquot (100 µL) of PSS (1 mg/mL) was then added to all 36 surfaces in sequence and left to incubate for 1 minute. The same rinsing protocol (above) was used post-incubation. This cycle of polymer addition and rinsing was repeated a total of 9 times for the (+) PEMs and 8 times for the (-) PEMs. The polymer incubation period for the last two layers of each PEM type (layers 10 and 11 of the (+) PEMs and layers 9 and 10 for the (-) PEMs) were left to incubate for 5 minutes. After the final rinsing step, when all polyelectrolyte layers had been added, the surfaces were left to dry with the lids ajar. Four strips of double-sided tape (1/2 in. double-sided polyester film tape, Tesa) were cut (6 cm long), and one strip (i) was added between two of three PEM surfaces in each row (S3 Fig b). On either side of the first strip of tape, two more strips (ii and iii) were added parallel to the first at 0.7 cm on either side. Finally, the last strip (iv) was added with the same 0.7 cm spacing to the left of strip iii. This was repeated for all six Petri dish lids. Next, the top plastic layer of each strip of tape was carefully removed using a tweezer. Each PEM surface was topped with a thin glass coverslip (1.5x1.5 cm, VWR), where the PEM was positioned at the center, and the coverslip edges contacted the double-sided tape strips on either side (S3 Fig b). Pressure was applied by hand at all points of contact between the cover slip and tape. All chip inlets and the inlet-facing edge of all coverslips had hydrophobic boundaries drawn on via a black permanent marker (S3 c). Bacteria were first prepared by inoculating the strain of interest and incubating it overnight with shaking (220 RPM) at 37˚C in LB. Bacteria were sub-cultured the next day at 1:1000 into fresh LB and incubated with shaking at 37˚C for 4–6 hours to the desired optical densities measured at 600 nm (OD600). The specific species, strains, mutants, and OD600 measurements pre- and post-resuspension in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) can be found in S1 Table. All test bacteria were laboratory stock, and all Staphylococcus aureus walKR mutants were sourced from a previous study [20]. S. aureus ATCC29213 walR EV and walR murOP were both grown in LB containing 12 µg/mL chloramphenicol, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) CA-USA300 ∆tarO-10 was grown in LB containing 300 µg/mL spectinomycin. Next, two 1 mL aliquots were transferred to individual Eppendorf tubes and centrifuged at 8000 x g for 3 minutes to obtain a pellet for each strain. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was resuspended with 500 µL PBS. The 500 µL suspensions of two tubes from the same original culture were combined to produce a concentrated suspension (1 mL) each. The cells were rinsed two more times with PBS. Subsequently, all concentrated PBS suspensions were further serially diluted two-fold to produce four unique dilutions per suspension labelled C1-C4 from lowest to highest cell concentration. All bacteria were tested using three biological replicates, where each suspension was prepared from a single colony. All fluidic chips were arranged by PEM type in a biosafety cabinet with Petri covers removed. Groups of three PEMs in a row were marked C1-C4, covering all cell suspension concentrations per PEM type (N = 3 replicates per concentration per PEM type). The steps involved in the addition of a bacterial suspension to a fluid lane are illustrated in S5 Fig. Once the same-day bacterial suspensions reached the desired range of optical densities, all 36 fluid lanes were pre-wet with 100 µL of PBS for 30 minutes (1). Post-wetting, excess PBS buffer was removed via Kimwipe contact at both the fluid lane inlets and outlets while preventing the removal of PBS from the fluid lane interiors. Aliquots (70 µL) of C1-C4 cell suspensions were pipetted onto the marked lane inlets (N = 36), one suspension per lane per PEM type in triplicates, and were wicked through in sequence via Kimwipes in contact with the lane outlet (2). The suspensions were left to interact for 10 minutes (3). Post-interaction, all lanes were rinsed with a 100 µL aliquot of PBS buffer in the sequence that the suspensions were wicked through initially (4). This step was repeated for a total of 200 µL PBS wicked through using a fresh Kimwipe per lane. With all lanes rinsed, each PEM surface (N = 36) was imaged 10 times per surface (N = 360 total images per type of bacterium) using an inverted microscope (S5 Fig). All images were taken at 200x magnification, and the positions along each surface were selected randomly (S6 Fig). Areas containing large pieces of dust or debris were avoided. All images were batch processed in ImageJ (open source) to count the surface-bound cells: the left and right edges were cropped out, followed by applying the Find Maxima function (15 prominence, excluding edge cases) to extract cell counts. The batch processing macros code is as follows: makeRectangle(503, 1, 925, 1079); run(“Crop”); run(“Find Maxima...”, “prominence=15 exclude output=Count”); The mean cell counts across replicates per added bacterial suspension concentration (OD600) were plotted to produce attachment curves (mean ± SEM) per PEM type per bacterium (S2 Fig). All cell counts across all replicates were plotted per added bacterial suspension concentration (OD600) and a linear regression was applied. The interaction strength values (slope values) per bacterial-PEM combination were collected per bacterial type to produce each bacteria-specific SIP. Polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) films were selected as the probe substrates in this study due to their simple and highly reproducible fabrication process, the layer-by-layer assembly (Fig 1b), which yields robust thin films with easily adjustable surface properties [21]. The PEM surface properties (e.g. charge, hydrophobicity, roughness) are determined by the deposition conditions (e.g. pH, ionic strength) and the polymer type, primarily in the topmost exposed layer [22,23]. Each individual PEM offers a variety of interactions from the charged (positive or negative), uncharged, hydrophobic and hydrophilic moieties present in the polymers used, expanding the pool of interactions needed while maintaining a small number of probing substrates. The individual polymer layers are deposited under equilibrium conditions, such that while they are structurally amorphous, the distribution of these distinct chemical features is reproducibly uniform. All fabricated PEMs used in this study were pre-wet with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) for 30 minutes to allow them time to reconfigure through polymer relaxation and to prevent this process from impacting the bacterial-PEM interactions. Bacteria were introduced as liquid suspensions in PBS to ensure that they remained viable throughout the duration of each experiment. The suspensions were introduced to each PEM through individual microfluidic channels (Fig 1f) that were designed to limit variability in fluid flow rate and direction. Shear stress caused by fluid flow can significantly impact bacterial attachment [24], requiring consistent control over the hydrodynamics of our channels. The SIPs of all test bacteria were plotted as a heat map (Fig 2a), highlighting distinct differences in the relative magnitudes of their interaction strengths across each PEM. While grouping the pathogen SIPs by Gram stain (Fig 2b), we observed the Gram-negative bacteria as having a stronger attachment preference for PEI while the Gram-positive bacteria preferred PSS. This was unsurprising, given that these two classes represent broad differences in bacterial envelope structure and surface chemistry, including polymer layers that encompass the cell. They comprise lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in Gram-negatives and teichoic acids (TA) in Gram-positives, both of which play an important factor in surface attachment [8]. For example, TAs were reported to be significant for attachment to plastics and glass found on biomedical devices [16]. Coincidentally, removing TAs in methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) through a tarO deletion produced SIPs with reduced attachment strengths across all PEMs compared to the wild type (WT) (Fig 2c). a, The interaction strengths of all twelve test bacteria plotted as a heatmap for SIP comparison. b, The SIPs organized by Gram stain (mean ± SEM). c-f, All SIPs across S. aureus mutants (mean ± SEM). a, The interaction strengths of all twelve test bacteria plotted as a heatmap for SIP comparison. b, The SIPs organized by Gram stain (mean ± SEM). c-f, All SIPs across S. aureus mutants (mean ± SEM). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0327489.g002 SIPs continued to be distinguishable at the species level among the clinically significant pathogens (Fig 2a), with differentiating factors including the average magnitude of interaction strengths across PEMs (average SIP), and the variance of interaction strengths across PEMs (SIP spread). Notably, among these strains, Pseudomonas aeruginosa displayed the highest average SIP, and vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA) had the smallest SIP spread. Isolating the exact differences in bacterial surface features that produced the observed shifts in SIP is non-trivial and beyond the scope of this initial study. However, experimental clues suggest that differences in SIPs may not be limited to surface chemistry alone. Within the Gram-negative pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa displayed significantly higher interaction strengths across all PEMs (Fig 1i) and is unique in its expression of flagella. These hairlike appendages confer swimming motility and increase the probability of surface encounters in P. aeruginosa [25,26], likely contributing to its increased average SIP. Examining other surface features and the genes that control them may be as simple as tracking changes in SIP between a set of mutants and their WT. To investigate further, we compared SIPs of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in S. aureus with single-point mutations in the wal operon, a key regulator of the autolysin-encoding genes in cell wall metabolism [27]. The first case study was S. aureus with a single-point mutation in walR, which reduced peptidoglycan recycling and increased the cell wall thickness [20]. This was followed by a subsequent single-point mutation in walK that restored cell wall metabolism and thickness back to approximately WT levels [20]. The walR SIP (Fig 2d) displayed a notable decrease in interaction strength for PEI and PSS and a comparable increase for PDDA, amounting to an overall drop in average SIP compared with the WT. The walK SIP reverted to an approximate WT SIP while preserving the order of PDDA and PEI preference from walR. In our second case study, cell wall thickness was reverted instead by adding the mupGmurQmurP operon encoded on a plasmid (Fig 2e), in effect corroborating the restoration of cell wall metabolism by producing a SIP similar to that of walK. Mutations in the walKR system have been linked to multidrug-resistant pathways in S. aureus [28]. Reduced susceptibility to vancomycin, a last-line antibiotic used to treat serious MRSA infections [29], is primarily associated with modifications to the cell wall peptide sequence that reduce the binding affinity and action of vancomycin [30]. However, vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA) isolates have also displayed thicker cell walls analogous to the walR mutant [12]. Coincidentally, the shifts in SIP from MRSA to VISA (Fig 1m) showed a decrease in average SIP and SIP spread, with drops in PEI and PSS interaction strengths similar to those observed in walR (Fig 1k). The more subtle shift in SIP from WT to MRSA (Fig 1m) was not unexpected as the action of methicillin resistance is mainly internal to the cell [31], though minor shifts in wall TA glycosylation have been observed [13]. Very subtle modifications like these could be detectable by improving SIP specificity through an increase in the number and diversity of test surfaces used to provide additional interactions. Regardless, both MRSA and VISA present serious risk factors in clinical settings [32,33] and being able to quickly distinguish between them (and possibly other resistant mutants) in tandem with bacterial identification presents an unignorable clinical potential for SIPs. In principle, we could determine the identity of an unknown pathogen by matching its SIP to one in a library of pre-measured SIPs. This library would be generated and continuously updated by measuring and compiling the SIPs of all current and new clinically relevant bacterial pathogens and antibiotic-resistant mutants using an optimized protocol developed for a future SIP-based diagnostic. To explore further, three test pathogens were randomly selected, their suspensions prepared blind, and their SIPs measured. We were able to successfully identify each blind test pathogen by comparing and matching SIPs (Fig 3a): i) Enterococcus faecalis, ii) Acinetobacter baumannii, and iii) Klebsiella pneumoniae. The attachment curves and interaction strength values between the blind test pathogens and their correctly identified clinically relevant strain counterparts displayed significant agreement across PEMs (Fig 3b) and were the highest percent matching pairs among all possible SIPs (S2 Table). a, All clinically significant pathogen and blind test pathogen SIPs are plotted as a heat map. b, The bacterial-surface attachment curves (surface-adhered cell counts plotted against suspension optical densities) of blind pathogens i, ii, and iii compared with their correctly identified counterparts E. faecalis, A. baumannii, and K. pneumoniae, respectively (mean ± SEM). a, All clinically significant pathogen and blind test pathogen SIPs are plotted as a heat map. b, The bacterial-surface attachment curves (surface-adhered cell counts plotted against suspension optical densities) of blind pathogens i, ii, and iii compared with their correctly identified counterparts E. faecalis, A. baumannii, and K. pneumoniae, respectively (mean ± SEM). https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0327489.g003 Herein, we introduced a novel technique capable of rapidly differentiating a set of bacteria through their surface interactions, utilizing a quick 10-minute interaction period and only three probing surfaces. By comparing our first-generation SIPs, we were able to successfully distinguish between clinically significant pathogens from Gram stain to individual species. Furthermore, we confirmed the restoration of cell wall metabolism via tracking and comparing SIPs between a series of S. aureus mutants in the walKR system, broadening the scope and utility of this technique. Lastly, an early glance at its predictive capabilities combined with distinguishing single- and multidrug-resistant forms of S. aureus underscored its clinical relevance and future diagnostic potential in combining pathogen identification and AST under a single, rapid, low-cost test.
