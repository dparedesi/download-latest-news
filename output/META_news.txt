Title: Nvidia Slams Biden ‘Overreach’ And Praises Trump—As AI Stock Enters Correction Territory

Nvidia blasted the Biden administration and hyped President-elect Donald Trump in a Monday press release reacting to more export restrictions targeting Nvidia’s highly sought-after artificial intelligence chips, a criticism coinciding with a rare down stretch on Wall Street for Nvidia—and mounting Silicon Valley support for Trump. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris discuss AI in 2023. President Joe Biden announced Monday a framework to govern the transfer of AI technology most famously designed by Nvidia to cap AI chip sales abroad at both the country and company levels, a move which the White House characterized as an effort to keep away the advanced AI systems out of the hands of “countries of concern” as Biden has voiced concern about China’s use of American-made AI throughout his presidency. The potential for limited exports poses a potential headache for Nvidia, as China, Singapore and Taiwan accounted for more than half of the company’s $35 billion in revenue during its most recent financial quarter, with China alone accounting for $5.4 billion of Nvidia’s quarterly sales. Nvidia lashed out against the rules in a strongly worded statement: “The new Biden rules would only weaken America’s global competitiveness, undermining the innovation that has kept the U.S. ahead,” clapped back Ned Finkle, Nvidia’s vice president of government affairs, arguing it’s an attempt from the White House “to rig market outcomes and stifle competition.” The Nvidia response also indicated a warm attitude toward Trump, as Finkle wrote the “first Trump Administration laid the foundation” for the recent AI revolution. Nvidia looks “forward to a return to policies that strengthen American leadership, bolster our economy and preserve our competitive edge in AI and beyond,” Finkle added. Shares of Nvidia fell as much as 4.7% to $129.51 shortly after market open, as pressure on its abroad business accelerated its recent stock market slump. The stock was down more than 15% from its all-time-high share price set last week, erasing as much as $578 billion in market capitalization from its $3.75 trillion valuation peak set Tuesday morning. Other big technology stocks struggled Monday, with shares of Alphabet, Apple and Tesla all declining at least 1% as the S&P 500 benchmark index sank to its lowest level since early November. Much of Nvidia’s stock surge came while Biden was in office. The company’s share price is up 880% since Biden’s 2021 inauguration, compared to a 414% rally during Trump’s first term, according to FactSet data. Nvidia is far from the first big tech firm to express excitement about the prospects of Trump’s second term, with the likes of Amazon and Alphabet committing $1 million to Trump’s inauguration fund as industry leaders like Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Apple CEO Tim Cook and Amazon chairman Jeff Bezos all met with Trump following his November election win. Zuckerberg also announced sweeping changes to Meta’s policies ahead of Trump’s inauguration: The company is ditching fact-checks in favor of X-style community notes, and Trump ally Dana White will join the board. Trump’s administration includes the newly-created role of “White House AI & Crypto Czar,” filled by Silicon Valley venture capitalist David Sacks, in an effort to make the U.S. “the clear global leader” in AI and cryptocurrency, Trump said in December. Nvidia is the face of the 2020s generative AI boom, as it designs a majority of the data-intensive hardware and software systems used to train AI technology like OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot and Tesla’s self-driving programs.

Title: There’s a reason why it feels like the internet has gone bad | CNN Business

Markets Hot Stocks Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News Hot Stocks Follow: A version of this story appeared in CNN Business’ Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. Facebook is full of AI slop. X is full of “free thinkers” peddling conspiracies. Google’s search results are telling us to eat rocks. More and more, it feels like the internet has gone bad. There’s an increasingly popular theory about why: “enshittification.” The term, coined in 2022 by the author, journalist and activist Cory Doctorow, refers broadly to the deterioration of services (especially online) as a result of giant companies extracting maximum profits from their customers. In a 2023 essay for Wired, Doctorow laid out the basic arc of enshittification, or the process by which platforms die. “First, they are good to their users; then they abuse their users to make things better for their business customers; finally, they abuse those business customers to claw back all the value for themselves. Then, they die.” In other words: Products are good when they first hit the market, because companies need to lock in as many consumers as they can to achieve the huge scale they desire. Once everyone’s using the product, the company refocuses on creating value for business partners, padding its profit margins and letting the product corrode. Eventually, the company maxes out what it can extract from its business partners, too, and the whole thing fades into obsolescence. Once you wrap your head around the idea, you start to see enshittification all around — not only online, but across the economy, in services that have been picked over by private equity (vet clinics, nursing homes, prisons, countless other industries) or in the products peddled by highly concentrated industries. The Australian dictionary Macquarie even crowned it the 2024 word of the year, noting its power to capture “what many of us feel is happening to the world and to so many aspects of our lives at the moment.” On Tuesday, shortly after Meta’s CEO announced a widely criticized plan to dispense with fact-checkers, I spoke with Doctorow about the future of social media and how “enshittification” can help us make sense of our collective online angst. The following interview has been edited for length and clarity. Nightcap: Could you give me your your cocktail-party-level introduction to “enshittification”? Cory Doctorow: I think of enshittification as a theory about what happens when you have power without consequence. We have increased the power available to large firms for a long time by reducing our antitrust enforcement, allowing mergers, predatory pricing, all the conduct that allows firms to get very big. That’s been across the board, not just with tech. Nightcap: What does that look like, in real life? Doctorow: There’s a law, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, that makes it illegal to break digital rights management. So for example, if Audible (which is owned by Amazon) sells you one of my audiobooks, they require that it have digital rights management that locks it to Audible’s platform forever — you can’t unlock it, quit Audible and take your books with you. And if I give you a tool to jailbreak the audiobook so you can go somewhere else, I commit a felony punishable by a five-year prison sentence and a $500,000 fine. So even though I am the rights holder to that work, Amazon, the intermediary who sold you the work, has more intellectual-property rights to that work than I do. This is a law that is oriented around allowing these large firms to wield regulation against competitors, against their own workforce and against their users so that they can maintain power. It’s a collapse of discipline — they don’t have to worry about their workers, they don’t have to worry about regulators. And they bought all their competitors. Nightcap: Meta would seem like a kind of textbook case of enshittification. Facebook used to feel like a premium service, but the last few years it’s felt like it’s lost the plot. Doctorow: Meta is a great example because they go through this pretty neat set of stages… They had this very straightforward value prop, which was like, just tell us who matters to you, and we’ll show you everything they post. And their pitch to the general public was, Facebook is like MySpace, but we won’t spy on you. Nightcap: Right, that feels very much like aughts-era Facebook, when we could all just see our friends and enjoy the virtual connection. What changed? Doctorow: Facebook at a certain point goes to publishers and says, create a Facebook page, post short excerpts to it, don’t worry about how many people follow you — we’re going to recommend it to users. So we’re going to show users things that they never asked to see in order to take some value away from them and give it to publishers. You see the same thing with advertisers. Facebook not only offers to use surveillance data to benefit advertisers in the form of targeting, but they also invest heavily in anti-ad-fraud and in services to advertisers. So if your ads are not performing, they’ll help you figure it out, but also, if someone’s ripping you off, they’ll help you get your money back. And so you see the users getting locked in by each other. They’re providing so much value to each other that they can’t bring themselves to leave, even as the service is getting monotonically worse. And that’s as far as I think a lot of people take it — “Facebook’s got a mind control ray, they’re hacking your dopamine loops, and you can’t escape Facebook and they’re gonna sell you to advertisers.” The evidence for “hacking your dopamine loops” is pretty thin. There’s much better evidence that people just care about their friends more than they hate Mark Zuckerberg, and so they stay there. Nightcap: Your theory adds a third step here, where Facebook also turns its back on advertisers, too? Doctorow: Right, once the advertisers were fully committed to a Facebook strategy, advertising got way more expensive and the amount of ad fraud you got was crazy. So the advertisers are getting screwed, the publishers are getting screwed, the end users are getting screwed. Nightcap: I’m not asking you to look into a crystal ball here, but if you had to speculate, what’s next for Facebook or other decaying platforms? Doctorow: Zuckerberg is insulated from the consequences of making bad choices until he’s not, right? Until things reach a breaking point, and then he tends to panic. Tech calls these panics “pivots,” but they’re just the outcome of being the CEO of a company that posts anemic growth or even a contraction in its user base and sees (Wall Street) just go nuts on you. First, it was the Metaverse… which is like a not-very-successful video game that they spent billions on. Zuck could do that because he controls the majority of the voting shares and because he had huge cash reserves. And now we’re seeing these weird announcements that they’re going to have AI -generated users who are going to interact with you. This is, again, a visibly terrible idea. It could be a way to continue to post growth if users will tolerate it. But the equilibrium that Zuck has shot for, with Facebook and with Instagram, has been a service that is nearly so bad that people want to leave. The anthropologist danah boyd describes how in the last days of MySpace, she could see how when one person who a lot of people talk to would leave, then a whole bunch of people would follow. It wasn’t the only reason they were there, but it was the last thing keeping them there, and then, boom, the bottom falls out and the net just starts to unravel. This is where Facebook is. They are trying to maintain this equilibrium where they extract enough that they keep their shareholders happy, but not so much that people leave. They’re now at the end of a long run of extremely bad choices. I’m not shorting Meta stock, but I think that they are on the path to becoming a kind of zombie — something like MySpace is today. You know, MySpace still exists. You can go to MySpace. It’s just AI-generated slop and and spam. (Note: Meta didn’t respond to Nightcap’s request for comment.) Nightcap: How are you feeling about the future of tech? Doctorow: In terms of the future of enshittification, these platforms that have hollowed themselves out, where there’s just no value left in them except this kind of awful lock-in. It’s the old “we go broke a little, and then all at once.” I do think there is reason to be hopeful. As a science fiction writer, I know that prediction is a mug’s game. But as an activist, I’m like, well, you take the weakest flank where you can make the biggest strategic advance, and you march on that flank. And there are a lot of weak flanks in global big tech. I’d say the last one is the potential for an alliance between people who are angry about other kinds of monopolies, because it’s not just tech — people are really angry about grocery monopolies and oil monopolies, sea freight monopolies, eyeglass monopolies. One company, EssilorLuxottica, owns every eyewear brand you’ve ever heard of and every eyewear store you’ve ever shopped at, and they make more than 50% of the lenses, and they own EyeMed, the largest insurer in the world, and they’ve raised the price of glasses 1,000% in the last decade. (EssilorLuxottica didn’t respond to Nightcap’s request for comment.) So people are pissed off about monopolies. And if they can make a coalition, it’ll be like when we discovered the word “ecology” in the ’70s — we realized that just because you care about owls and I care about the ozone layer, it doesn’t mean we’re not caring about the same thing. Every time you see the world change all of a sudden, it’s because a new coalition has popped up. Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Title: SteelSeries Apex Pro TKL Wireless Gen 3 review: a premium gaming keyboard with stellar analog performance – and a price to match

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The SteelSeries Apex Pro TKL Wireless Gen 3 is a solid gaming keyboard that’s effortless to use. The analog switches with their adjustable actuation points work well in practice, thanks to the feedback they provide. However, this is a rather specialist feature that not every gamer will want or need, and given the hefty price tag, there are better value wireless gaming keyboards out there. Excellent gaming performance Analog switches work well Premium build quality Expensive Lacking some analog tweaks Typing not the best Why you can trust TechRadar We spend hours testing every product or service we review, so you can be sure you’re buying the best. Find out more about how we test. The SteelSeries Apex Pro TKL Wireless Gen 3 is the latest incarnation in the brand’s line of elite gaming keyboards, with various improvements for even better gaming performance. The looks downplay its gaming prowess, with the RGB lighting and floating keycaps being the only signals in this regard. Still, it looks smart and sophisticated, and the build quality is excellent. It’s quite thick yet not as heavy as you might expect. Every aspect of its built feels premium, right down to the included wrist pad, which is soft yet durable; it’s easily on a par with the best gaming keyboard out there. The double shot PBT keycaps also feel great, with a pleasantly grainy texture. There are various keyboard shortcuts available by default, accessible via SteelSeries’ Meta modifier key (essentially a function key). These include altering the global actuation point, toggling rapid trigger, changing profiles, recording macros, and switching between three Bluetooth devices. Similar functions can also be found on the OLED screen in the top right corner of the Apex Pro, with navigation achieved via a dedicated button and the volume wheel. This screen can also be customized in SteelSeries’ GG software, letting you upload images and GIFs to display, and can be used to view system and in-game information. Overall GG is easy to use and offers plenty of other customizations to sink your teeth into. There are various keyboard shortcuts to configure, although the system-level functions are lacking somewhat. There are also default profiles for certain games, including Counter-Strike 2, DOTA 2, Minecraft and League of Legends. You can set binds to activate on press or release, and the dual actuation mode lets you assign two binds to a single key, each one activated depending on how hard you press, which works effectively. It’s a shame, though, that there’s no visual feedback to show how your actuation settings work in practice. When it comes to gaming, the Apex Pro really shines: the clack of key presses is very satisfying, the indented keycaps provide a planted finger position, and the bottom row is easy to access thanks to the slope of the keycaps. The layout is quite compact, but I still found it manageable. The switches offer fast yet smooth performance, and hitting certain actuation points is easy thanks to their feel. It is a shame, however, there aren’t more settings available to emulate the analog control of a gamepad. Also, the wrist rest also cuts off abruptly with no downwards slope, so my palm hung off the edge awkwardly while in the WASD position. Without it, though, I found the keys were raised too high to reach without adopting a more fingertip-oriented position. Typing with the Apex Pro isn’t the best experience either. I personally prefer shallower keycaps, and I found gliding around on the Apex Pro awkward. There’s no doubt the Apex Pro is a premium piece of hardware, and it commands a premium price tag. It may not be as expensive as some of its rivals, such as the Razer BlackWidow V4 Pro 75%, but it runs close. There are cheaper gaming keyboards with analog switches, such as the Turtle Beach Vulcan 2 TKL Pro, although this is wired only and can’t quite match the Apex Pro for performance. So if you’ve got the money to spend, the Apex Pro is hard to top for an analog keyboard. The Apex Pro costs $269 / £259 (about AU$456) and is available now in black only. It comes with a wrist pad and replacement keycaps can be purchased from SteelSeries’ website. A mini version is also available which loses the OLED screen, and a full-size variant adds a number pad as well as a larger scroll wheel and screen button. The Apex Pro sits atop the market in terms of price, eclipsing some of Razer’s best offerings, for instance. Although not quite as pricey as the BlackWidow V4 Pro 75%, it’s more expensive than the Huntsman V2 Analog, our pick as the best gaming keyboard. What sets that board apart is the 360-degree motion of the switches keys, letting you mimic an analog stick on a gamepad even more closely. It’s wired only, though. If you’re looking for another analog keyboard, then the Turtle Beach Vulcan 2 TKL Pro is considerably less expensive than the Apex Pro. Although it’s wired only and has some issues with its analog implementation, the Vulcan 2 is still a worthy contender in the sector. Value: 3 / 5 The Apex Pro looks understated for a gaming keyboard. The totally black design is bereft of the brash trappings common in the sector, so at first glance you’ll struggle to identify its intended audience. The floating keycaps, though, are a giveaway, as is the opulent RGB lighting. There’s no denying the Apex Pro has a premium aura, though. It’s also substantial, with a thick, two-tiered chassis, but fortunately it isn’t as heavy as it looks. The build quality is impeccable, with every material, join and key feeling smooth and sturdy. The double-shot PBT keycaps are lightly textured and feel great under your fingers. They’re quite thick and sit high above the board, allowing for deep presses. If they aren’t to your liking, though, they can be swapped out, and a puller is included. The layout is also quite compact, which I had to get used to, but it didn’t take long to adapt. The wrist pad is similarly well-built yet pleasingly light, with a smooth rubberized layer that’s both durable and comfortable. It connects magnetically to the board itself, and although the connection is quite weak, it suffices. There are several default hotkeys on the Apex Pro, accessible with SteelSeries’ own modifier key, called the Meta key. These include global adjustments for the actuation point and rapid trigger function, as well changing profiles, recording macros, and switching between three Bluetooth devices. However, more detailed settings and customizations are available via the Engine tool within the GG software. All keys can be remapped, and can be set to trigger on press or release. There’s a good selection of actions, including profile switching, keyboard setting adjustments and app launching. There are also OS shortcuts that can be mapped, including a selection of media keys and copy and paste, but there aren’t many more than this; those in other peripheral software are more numerous. GG also allows you to set actuation points ranging from 0.1mm to 4mm for all main keys. You can also toggle rapid trigger for each individual key, which, as GG explains, dynamically alters the actuation point when spamming, allowing for rapid-twitch movements. It even has a dual binding mode, allowing a single key to have two different binds, depending on the primary and secondary actuation points of your choosing. For the most part, GG is easy to use with a clear layout and some explanations for various settings. However, it would’ve been nice to see some visual feedback when adjusting actuation points and rapid trigger modes, as some of the Apex Pro’s rivals offer with their own software. Nestled in the top right corner of the Apex Pro is a small monotone OLED screen, called the Smart Screen. It displays battery life by default, but can be customized in GG to display anything from your own images and GIFs, to system and in-game information. The options available for the latter are quite in depth. For instance, you can choose to display certain information at certain increments, and choose various screens to cycle through, each displaying their own unique information at various points. Supported games include Counter-Strike 2, DOTA 2, Minecraft, and League of Legends. There’s also a button on the screen that can be used to control media playback, such as play / pause and next / previous functions. You can enter a menu by holding this button down for a few seconds, from which more settings and functions are available: you can change the brightness of the RGB illumination, toggle between three of your connected Bluetooth devices, and change the global actuation point and rapid trigger functions. Navigation in this menu is achieved with the volume wheel acting as a scroller, and it’s responsive and effective. Design & features: 4 / 5 The gaming performance of the Apex Pro is excellent. The stock keycaps are nicely indented, allowing you to maintain a secure position, and presses are weighted just right, allowing for easy actuation that provides pleasant feedback. Reaching the CTRL key and spacebar is also easy, thanks to the slight incline of the keycaps. The switches are silky smooth and well lubed, offering plenty of clack without being too loud. I also found it relatively easy to hit certain actuation points, as the Hall-effect magnetic switches have more feel and resistance than others I’ve tried, such as those on the Turtle Beach Vulcan 2 TKL Pro. This makes the Apex Pro ideal for rapid trigger functionality or dual binding. SteelSeries has also implemented a new Protection mode, which prevents keys adjacent to the intended one from accidentally triggering by reducing their sensitivity momentarily, which is a useful feature. Where it does miss a trick, however, is the ability to map the keys to an analog stick. This would make for smoother character movements and vehicle control, and is something that can be done with the aforementioned Turtle Beach Vulcan 2 TKL Pro, as well as the Razer Huntsman V2 Analog. As someone who prefers shallow keycaps for typing, I didn’t find the Apex Pro well suited for productivity purposes. Although adjusting the actuation point can help to prevent typos, the relatively thick keycaps and their deep indentations aren’t conducive to gliding around the board. The included wrist pad is pretty much essential for typing comfortably, as the thick body forces your wrists to bend awkwardly without one. Thankfully, the one included offers enough support and padding to make both typing and gaming more comfortable. The wrist pad can be more cumbersome when gaming, though. As the backend tails off abruptly with no slope, the area where your wrist meets your palm tends to overhang when in the WASD position, which is a strange and not entirely comfortable sensation. I did find that I could game without the pad, but I had to adapt my fingers so they were more perpendicular to the key caps, emphasizing more contact with the fingertips. If this is your preferred playing style anyway, then you shouldn’t have a problem. Steelseries claims a battery life of up 40 hours over Bluetooth, or 37.5 hours via the 2.4GHz dongle. During my tests I found this to be accurate, as I was able to get several days use out of it. Performance: 4.5 / 5 You want analog keysAnalog keys aren’t all that common, so if you want changeable sensitivity and rapid trigger functionality, this could be the board for you. You want top-tier performanceGaming with the Apex Pro is sublime, thanks to its smooth and fast performance. Actuation points are easy to hit and the rapid trigger works well. You’re on a budgetYou’ll be hard pressed to find many gaming keyboards that perform better than this, but it’ll cost you. You want controller emulationAlthough the switches are analog, you can’t emulate a gamepad’s triggers or analog sticks as you can with some other analog boards. Razer Huntsman V2 AnalogIf you must have an analog keyboard, then the Huntsman V2 Analog is another fine example in this category. Razer claims that the analog inputs can work with any controller-based game, allowing for ultra-smooth inputs. Uniquely, the keys also feature 360-degree movement, emulating a joystick more closely. The Huntsman V2 Analog can be had for slightly less than the Apex Pro, although if you hunt around you may be able to find a better deal. Read our Razer Huntsman V2 Analog review. Turtle Beach Vulcan 2 TKL ProIf you still want analog switches but want to save even more cash, then the Vulcan 2 TKL Pro could fit the bill. It also lets you emulate the triggers and analog sticks of a gamepad, although the implementation isn’t as seamless as you might imagine. Still, it can have its uses. Read our Turtle Beach Vulcan 2 TKL Pro review. I tested the Apex Pro for about a week. During that time I used it for gaming, productivity and general use. I played various games, including Counter-Strike 2 and I Am Your Beast, which were useful for testing the actuation points and rapid trigger functionality. I also made sure to make use of every feature and function available via the GG software where possible. I have been PC gaming for over 10 years, and have experienced numerous keyboards during that time, spanning various switch types, key profiles, and form factors. I have also reviewed multiple gaming keyboards from a mixture of brands. Lewis Maddison is a Reviews Writer for TechRadar.

Title: Meta has absolutely no clue what to do with AI

But it really wants in. Here’s why Meta is jamming AI into everything When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Meta has managed to cause controversy with its AI push yet again, after Instagram started showing users AI-generated pictures of themselves in their feeds. Shortly after redditor u/Green_Video_9831 used Meta AI to edit a selfie with Instagram’s 'Imagine Me' feature, he was startled to find his own face staring back at him from an AI-generated hall of mirrors in a targeted post on his feed. It seems that the company that recently brought you fake Instagram profiles, and fake Facebook chatbots of fake celebrities is now crossing new frontiers by bringing you a fake… you. When it was posted to the subreddit r/ABoringDystopia, the story quickly went viral, with users piling on scorn and disgust. When I saw this story, I was alarmed by the revolting tackiness of it all, but I wasn’t surprised. A very clear pattern has emerged in Meta’s behaviour – the company is going all-in on AI, but has no real idea what to do with it, what users want from it, or – crucially – how to make any money off it. But the war to be the best social media platform grinds on, shareholders demand their quarterly treats, and AI is still the hottest buzzword on the block. So, Meta is jamming AI into everything, throwing it all at the wall in the desperate hope that something, anything, manages to stick. I might be wrong, and if that’s the case then I encourage Mark Zuckerberg to come down here and community note my ass. But I don’t think I am. There’s a cycle that’s been playing out for literal years at this point: 1. Meta announces a big, splashy new AI feature 2. Users either revolt, make fun of it, or simply ignore it. 3. Meta quietly retires the feature. Daily design news, reviews, how-tos and more, as picked by the editors. 4. Go to 1. By far the biggest boondoggle so far has been the aforementioned celebrity AI chatbots. I wouldn’t blame you if you’ve already forgotten about it, so here’s a refresher. In late 2023, Meta announced that it would be bringing a host of AI assistant chatbots featuring various famous faces. Users would be able to have their questions answered by the likes of Snoop Dogg, MrBeast, Paris Hilton, Kendall Jenner and more. And where are they now, you ask? The whole thing was a disaster, users hated it, and the chatbots were boxed within less than a year. I never even saw them, because they were nixed before launching in the UK. It’s easy just to dismiss this whole sorry episode as another of Meta’s silly failed ventures – another Metaverse fashion week. But just think for a moment about how much it must have cost. One thing that unites Snoop Dogg, Paris Hilton, MrBeast and Kendall Jenner is that while they can be bought easily, they cannot be bought cheaply. And there were twenty-eight such celebs in this thing! Even at the most conservative estimates, it must have cost tens of millions, for absolutely zero return. I confidently predict that this latest feature – the ‘Imagined for You’ selfies that put u/Green_Video_9831 into a hall of mirrors – is going to go the exact same way. I’m not blind to the cute novelty factor of it – I’m sure you can imagine yourself enjoying seeing a pretty realistic-looking photo of yourself on the surface of Mars or in Blade Runner or whatever. But can you imagine yourself enjoying that more than once or twice? Can you imagine enjoying that on a regular enough basis that it significantly juices Meta’s engagement metrics? Can you imagine yourself paying for it? Even when you’re not paying Snoop Dogg money, generative AI is not a cheap technology. Those godawful fake Instagram profiles (remember Liv, the "proud Black queer momma of 2 & truth-teller”?) were not cheap to make, none of it is, and I firmly believe that Meta has no path to profitability with this stuff. If this all feels like a flailing tech giant desperately seeking to stay on top of the pile by burning money to over-leverage on underdeveloped technology that can’t really do the things they’re saying it can do – well, that’s because it is. And sure, Meta has a lot of money to burn. But nothing is infinite. At some point, they're going to hit the limits of what they can spend on this stuff without making any return. What comes after that? I don't know! I don't think Meta knows either, and I think the company is really, really hoping that it doesn't have to find out. Still, maybe I’m wrong. Maybe in six months’ time we’ll all be Imagining Ourselves in halls of mirrors all day and all night. Indeed, it’s entirely possible that Meta knows exactly what it is doing with AI and is just about to announce the one killer AI app that everybody simply has to have. I’m sure that’s just around the corner – but for now, I’m off to jack into the metaverse (now with legs) and check on the value of my Instagram NFT. I’m sure they’re both doing great.

Title: S&P’s $18 trillion rally threatened by psychology of 5% yields

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. (Bloomberg) -- For years it’s seemed like nothing could stop the stock market’s inexorable march higher, as the S&P 500 Index soared more than 50% from the start of 2023 to the end of 2024, adding $18 trillion in value in the process. Now, however, Wall Street is seeing what can ultimately derail this rally: Treasury yields above 5%. Most Read from Bloomberg A Blueprint for Better Bike Lanes What Robotaxis Brought San Francisco Ambitious High-Speed Rail Plans Advance in the Baltic Region New York, San Francisco Ranked Worst for US Traffic in City Centers Equities traders have shrugged off the bond market’s warnings for months, focusing instead on the windfall from President-elect Donald Trump’s promised tax cuts and the seemingly limitless possibilities of artificial intelligence. But the risk came into focus last week as Treasury yields climbed toward their ominous milestones and share prices sank in response. The yield on 20-year US Treasuries breached 5% on Wednesday and jumped back above on Friday, reaching the highest since Nov. 2, 2023. Meanwhile, 30-year US Treasuries briefly crossed 5% on Friday to the highest since Oct. 31, 2023. Those yields have risen roughly 100 basis points since mid-September, when the Federal Reserve started reducing the fed funds rate, which has come down 100 basis points over the same time. “It is unusual,” Jeff Blazek, co-CIO of multi-asset strategies at Neuberger Berman, said of the dramatic and rapid jump in bond yields in the early months of an easing cycle. Over the past 30 years, intermediate and longer-term yields have been relatively flat or modestly higher in the months after the Fed initiated a string of rate cuts, he added. Traders are watching the policy-sensitive 10-year Treasury yield, which is the highest it’s been since October 2023 and is rapidly approaching 5%, a level they fear could spark a stock market correction. It last passed the threshold briefly in October 2023, and before that you have to go back to July 2007. “If the 10-year hits 5% there will be a knee-jerk reaction to sell stocks,” said Matt Peron, Janus Henderson’s global head of solutions. “Episodes like this take weeks or maybe a few months to play out, and over the course of that the S&P 500 could get to down 10%.” The reason is fairly simple. Rising bond yields make returns on Treasuries more attractive, while also increasing the cost of raising capital for companies. The spillover into the stock market was apparent on Friday, as the S&P 500 tumbled 1.5% for its worst day since mid-December, turned negative for 2025, and came close to wiping out all the gains from the November euphoria sparked by Trump’s election. Building Barriers While there’s “no magic” to the fixation on 5% beyond round-number psychology, perceived barriers can create “technical barriers,” said Kristy Akullian, Blackrock’s head of iShares investment strategy. Meaning, a swift move in yields can make it difficult for stocks to rise. Investors are already seeing how. The earnings yield for the S&P 500 is sitting 1 percentage point below what’s offered by 10-year Treasuries, a development last seen in 2002. In other words, the return on owning a significantly less risky asset than the US equities benchmark hasn’t been this good in a long time. “Once yields get higher it becomes harder and harder to rationalize valuation levels,” said Mike Reynolds, vice president of investment strategy at Glenmede Trust. “And if earnings growth starts to falter, there can be issues.” Not surprisingly, strategists and portfolio managers predict a bumpy road ahead for stocks. Morgan Stanley’s Mike Wilson anticipates a tough six months for equities, while Citigroup’s wealth division told clients there’s a buying opportunity in bonds. The path to 5% on the 10-year Treasury became more realistic on Friday after strong jobs data caused economists to reduce expectations for rate cuts this year. But this isn’t just about the Fed. The selloff in bonds is global and based on sticky inflation, hawkish central banks, ballooning government debts, and extreme uncertainties presented by the incoming Trump administration. “When you’re in hostile waters, yields above 5% is where all bets are off,” Mark Malek, chief investment officer at Siebert, said. What equity investors need to know now is if, and when, serious buyers step in. “The real question is where we go from there,” said Rick de los Reyes, a portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price. “If it’s 5% on its way to 6% then that’s going to get people concerned, if it’s 5% before stabilizing and ultimately going lower then things will be fine.” Red Flags The key isn’t so much that yields are rising, but why, market pros say. A slow increase as the US economy improves can help stocks. But a quick jump due to concerns about inflation, the federal deficit and policy uncertainty is a red flag. In recent years, whenever yields have risen quickly, stocks have sold off. The difference this time appears to be complacent investors, as seen in bullish positioning in the face of frothy valuations and uncertainties about Trump’s policies. And that’s putting equities in a vulnerable position. “When you look at rising prices, a strong job market and an overall strong economy, it all points to a possible uptick in inflation,” said Eric Diton, president of the Wealth Alliance. “And that’s not even including Trump’s policies.” One area that may prove to be a haven for equity investors is the group that’s been driving most of the gains these past few years: Big Tech. The so-called Magnificent Seven companies — Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., Microsoft Corp., Nvidia Corp. and Tesla Inc. — are still posting rapid earnings growth and massive cash flows. Plus, looking to the future, they’re expected to be the biggest beneficiaries of the artificial intelligence revolution. “Investors typically seek high quality stocks with strong balance sheets and strong cash flows during market turmoil,” said Eric Sterner, chief investment officer at Apollon Wealth. “The mega techs have become part of that defensive play recently.” That’s the hope many equity investors are hanging on, that mega-cap tech companies’ sway over the broader market and their relative security will limit any weakness in the stock market. The Magnificent Seven have a more than 30% weighting in the S&P 500. At the same time, the Fed is in the midst of lowering interest rates, although the pace is likely going to be slower than expected. That makes this a very different situation than 2022, when the Fed was hiking rates rapidly and indexes plunged. Still, many Wall Street pros are urging investors to proceed cautiously for the time being as rate risk hits in various unexpected ways. “The companies in the S&P 500 that are up the most will probably be the most vulnerable — and that could include the Mag Seven — and some frothy areas of mid-cap and small-cap growth will likely be under pressure,” said Janus Henderson’s Peron. “We’ve been consistent across our firm on staying focused on quality and being valuation sensitive. That will be very important in the coming months.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek He Built Russia’s Biggest Tech Company.

Title: Jobs Report: Bond Yields Rise And Stocks Fall
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2025/01/12/jobs-report-bond-yields-rise-and-stocks-fall/
Time Published: 2025-01-12T12:00:00Z
Full Content:
The U.S. economy shows positive momentum, with robust job growth in last Friday's payrolls report. ... [+] The resilient growth removes almost any chance of another Federal Reserve rate cut soon. The robust and much higher-than-expected employment growth in the December jobs report on Friday essentially wiped out any thoughts of another Federal Reserve rate cut on January 29. Job growth continued to bounce back from the hurricanes and strike-impacted October data. The economy entered 2025 with some momentum, as the Atlanta Fed currently estimates 2.7% GDP growth for the fourth quarter. Employment grew by 256,000 nonfarm jobs, which was well above expectations. Previous data was revised slightly lower, but not enough to diminish the strong report. The household survey data was even more impressive, with a gain of 478,000 jobs, and the research series, which mirrors the payroll report criteria, rose by 102,000. Monthly Job Growth Wage growth was a little below expectations at 3.9% year-over-year, down from 4.0% last month. The average workweek hours were unchanged at 34.3, above the four-year low of 34.2 in January, July, and October. Work Hours & Wage Growth The high-frequency initial and continuing filings for unemployment benefits confirm the reversal of the impact of the hurricanes and strike. Initial filings are nearing the lows of 2024. However, continuing claims for benefits are above the lows, indicating some slowdown in people being rehired relative to early 2024. Initial Jobless Claim The unemployment rate ticked down to 4.1% from 4.2%. Before the decline from the August 2024 unemployment rate highs, the rate had risen enough off the lows to signal an impending recession by the Sahm Rule. The Sahm Rule has an unblemished track record of forecasting recession, but there are several reasons to believe that it might be overstating the risk of recession during this cycle. Last month, the rate was within a whisker of triggering the Sahm Rule again, but the December unemployment decline moved it away from danger. U.S. Recession Indicator Monitoring the prime-age, 25- to 54-year-old employment-to-population ratio should help signal when concern about the rising unemployment rate is warranted. The decline in the three-month average of the prime-age employment-to-population ratio is evidence of some labor market softening. It should be monitored closely, but it does not yet pose an imminent threat to the economy's health, and the monthly reading improved in December. Prime-Age Employment-To-Population Ratio: 3 Month Average The ten-year U.S. Treasury yield rose to a 52-week closing high of 4.76% in response to the resilient employment report. At 2.29%, real, after-inflation expectations, 10-year U.S. Treasury yields are now above the average during the 1999 to 2008 period and well above the post-global financial crisis period. 10-Year U.S. Treasury: Nominal & Real Yield Stocks had a down week and erased their year-to-date gains due to higher bond yields and an expectation of fewer Fed rate cuts. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), had a similar move lower. Stock Returns Though the outperformance declined slightly after the jobs report, the more economically sensitive cyclical stocks have outperformed defensive stocks, which are less impacted by the economy. This ratio remains elevated, which indicates that investors continue to price a low probability of recession risk in stocks. The more economically sensitive small-capitalization stocks and banks underperformed this week, so some cracks might be forming. Cyclical Versus Defensive Stocks This week, Wednesday’s Consumer Price Index inflation report is a crucial economic report. Consensus estimates expect December CPI to rise to 2.9% year-over-year from 2.7%. The Cleveland Fed’s CPI supports this view and should, combined with the robust jobs report, slam the door shut on any thought of a 0.25% cut at the January 29 meeting. U.S. CPI Inflation Estimate Futures pricing reacted to the strong jobs report by slashing the expectations for total Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2025 from two to just one 0.25% cut. Further, no Fed rate reductions are forecasted until at least mid-year. Number Of Expected Rate Cuts While the robust Friday jobs report would seemingly be good news, investors sent stocks lower and bond yields higher. Stocks often agitate for lower rates from the Federal Reserve, as easy money tends to feed speculation. In addition, bond yields have been moving higher, which can weigh on valuations. If higher yields are accompanied by economic growth and better corporate earnings, stocks can shake them off over time. While bond yields might continue to move higher, current yields have begun to look attractive when viewed through the expected after-inflation return. Wednesday’s CPI report could add to the upward pressure on bond yields. Disclosure: Glenview Trust currently has holdings of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), and Alphabet (GOOGL) within its recommended investment strategies.

Title: The Inauguration of Trump’s Oligarchy

Time Published: 2025-01-12T11:00:00Z

In modern terms, a Presidential Inauguration is an open-air branding opportunity. John F. Kennedy, a hatless Cold Warrior, placed his Administration at the vanguard of a new generation “born in this century,” and delivered an internationalist vow to “pay any price, bear any burden.” On January 20, 2017, Donald Trump set a distinctly different inaugural tone, delivering a sunless stem-winder of populist fury in which he vowed to heal the hellscape of “American carnage.” No longer would the country bow to self-serving élites and rapacious foreigners: “America will start winning again, winning like never before.” Upon leaving the reviewing stand, George W. Bush was heard to say, “That was some weird shit.” Trump was apoplectic about the coverage of his first hours in office, and he dispatched his spokesman, Sean Spicer, to the White House briefing room to declare that the press had “intentionally framed” images of the crowd to make it seem paltry, when, in fact, Trump had drawn, Spicer huffed incredibly, the “largest audience ever to witness an Inauguration, period.” Spicer then shifted registers to one of unmistakable threat. “And I’m here to tell you that it goes two ways,” he said. “We’re gonna hold the press accountable.” With that, the Era of Trump was truly inaugurated. Joe Biden, whose Presidency is now grinding to its conclusion, had hoped to render Trump’s Administration a historical fluke—a fleeting, if ugly, interregnum. And, as Biden leaves office, he can reasonably argue that jobs are up, inflation is down; violent crime has declined; and, for the first time in a generation, there are no American soldiers engaged in foreign battle. Nevertheless, Biden’s obdurate unwillingness to step aside for younger, more plausible Democratic candidates resulted in the reëmergence of his nemesis. Once more, the music of apocalypse is in the air: “Our Country is a disaster, a laughing stock all over the World!” Trump declared recently. He will return to the Oval Office with a résumé enhanced by two impeachments, one judgment of liability for sexual abuse, and a plump cluster of felony convictions. He will take the oath of office next week at the scene of his gravest transgression, his incitement of an insurrection on Capitol Hill. Still, Trump soldiers on, as if all the legal accusations against him are badges of merit, further proof of his anti-establishment street cred. Since the election, he has proposed so many advisers of low character and dubious qualification that he has overwhelmed the circuitry of the confirmation process and the public sphere. It’s almost as if the early proposition of Matt Gaetz to head the Justice Department were a way to divert attention from the unalloyed awfulness of so many others: Pete Hegseth, Kash Patel, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Tulsi Gabbard, Mehmet Oz, and Kristi Noem among them. The dessert for this feast of misbegotten nominations was served when Trump appointed Kimberly Guilfoyle, the longtime fiancée of his eldest son, Don, Jr., as the new Ambassador to Greece—a move that accommodates the son’s fresher affections for a Palm Beach socialite. Across the land, a willing suspension of disbelief has taken hold. (Critical thinking is so 2017.) Certain titans of Silicon Valley, Wall Street, and (God forgive us) the media have hustled off to Mar-a-Lago, a scene of such flagrant self-abnegation, ring-kissing, and genuflection that it would embarrass a medieval Pope. Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon and the owner of the Washington Post, no longer seems determined to fight the darkness; instead, he kills an endorsement drafted by his editors, watches as some of his most skilled reporters head for the exits, and pays forty million dollars for a documentary on Melania Trump. Mark Zuckerberg’s maga conversion is now so thorough that he has added Trump’s friend Dana White, the C.E.O. of Ultimate Fighting Championship, to the board of Meta. One of Trump’s most effective political maneuvers might be called “whacking the beehive,” a propensity to unleash so much buzzing menace into the air that it’s impossible to maintain calm, much less focus. Will he set up detention camps for undocumented immigrants? Will he split with nato and cut off Ukraine? Are we about to send the 82nd Airborne to descend on the good people of Nuuk? For decades, Vladimir Putin’s greatest rhetorical gambit has been the charge of hypocrisy. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, American critics have rightly described Russia as an oligarchic state. In the nineteen-nineties, a half-dozen or so hustlers emerged from the rubble of the old system to exploit their proximity to Boris Yeltsin and his family to snatch up invaluable state properties––oil fields, mines, television stations––at knockoff prices. Putin came along, in 2000, and eventually deposed most of the first-generation oligarchs, replacing them with his own satraps. He created a personalist system in which all power and all fortunes depended on his good graces. Perhaps what is most striking about the ascendant Trump Administration, which takes pains to cast itself as the champion of a forgotten working class, is its own oligarchic features. The influence of big money in American politics is hardly new. To read Theodore Dreiser’s “The Financier” is to plunge headlong into the muck of Gilded Age deceit. The essential modern text is Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, the 2010 Supreme Court decision that equates money with speech, resulting in an ever more corrupt system of campaign finance. Something ominous, if not entirely novel, is taking shape in Washington. When Trump takes the oath of office, on January 20th, Elon Musk, the wealthiest man in the world, will not be far away. Like so many other tech billionaires, Musk apparently thinks of himself as a self-reliant genius-of-the-future, a Nietzschean superman, and yet he well knows that everything from the rise of the Internet to the creation of many newer technologies profits from the support of the state. What’s more, Musk’s influence, unlike that of his Gilded Age predecessors, is amplified by his gargantuan following on a social-media engine in his possession. When Trump steps up to the lectern next week to recite the oath of office, he will stand beside his wife. But he will have a great deal of other company—multibillionaires who have shamelessly dispensed with principle to seek an indulgent new President’s favor and enhance their fortunes. ♦

Title: Index Funds? Nope. We’re Doing This For 8%+ Tech Dividends And Upside

Investor managing portfolio. Pie chart and candlestick charts. We need to talk about tech stocks. Because, yes, there is a risk of a pullback here. But there’s also a way for us to minimize that risk—and grab 8%+ dividends, plus price upside, as we do so. First off, let me be clear that when I say “tech stocks,” I’m using the NASDAQ 100 as my benchmark. The index is about 60% tech, compared to about a third for the S&P 500. That higher level of tech exposure has allowed the NASDAQ to handily beat the S&P 500 over the long run That outperformance started to slow last year, with the NASDAQ only barely edging out the S&P 500. And as I write this, the NASDAQ’s P/E ratio is 37.2, higher than at any point since the dot-com bubble and well above the S&P 500’s measure of 27.9. Why the stretched valuation? The first thing that comes to mind is AI, which is already driving efficiencies outside the tech sector, such as in manufacturing, law and medicine. Meantime, the existence of open-source models, plus fierce competition between tech firms like Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta Platforms (META), OpenAI, Anthropic, Amazon.com (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT) and others, shows that AI will keep falling in cost, which could slow the continued rise of the large-cap AI stocks. This, by the way, is part of our 2025 AI-investing strategy at CEF Insider: Spread our money across high-yielding closed-end funds (CEFs) that hold big-cap AI names and also invest in companies outside tech that are poised to profit from the technology’s continued growth. Our Adams Diversified Equity Fund (ADX), for example, yields right around 9% now and not only holds firms like Microsoft, Alphabet and NVIDIA (NVDA), but also stocks like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM), which stands to benefit as AI helps its portfolio managers make better decisions. ADX also holds Visa (V), which is using AI to improve fraud detection, lower costs and boost its margins. Another reason we could see a pullback in the NASDAQ this year is due to the resurgence of cryptocurrency driving unsustainable spending in the tech sector. We saw this in 2021, when surges in Bitcoin prices drove upward momentum on the NASDAQ. Then the bubble popped in 2022, and the NASDAQ slumped in sympathy. With Bitcoin surging again, we could be at the start of another, similar cycle. Consider, for example, the inclusion of MicroStrategy Inc. (MSTR) in the NASDAQ 100. The stock is basically a Bitcoin proxy, and while it did surge on the announcement that it would join the index, it plummeted shortly after. To be sure, one risky, unprofitable stock like MicroStrategy taking a tumble isn’t a major issue on its own (except to the people who own it, of course!). But if the stock is part of a broader index, it’s a risk to anyone investing in that index more broadly. This is a big reason why we prefer CEFs for investing in both tech and across the market—our funds’ active managers can navigate around risks like MicroStrategy, while index funds must hold the entire index at all times. Moreover, looking ahead to 2025, if the NASDAQ falls behind the S&P 500 this year, more investors are likely to look for other ways to get tech exposure, beyond a NASDAQ index fund, and actively managed CEFs, with their high dividends, are likely to have a lot of appeal. Speaking of dividends, tech-focused CEFs yield around 8% on average, as I write this. That high cash payout lets you capture profits from tech stocks more easily than you could with a NASDAQ-100 index fund like the Invesco QQQ Trust, Series 1 (QQQ)—current yield 0.5%—where a selloff could erase your “paper gains.” Below we see the market prices of two tech CEFs through 2024: the 8%-yielding BlackRock Science and Technology Trust (BST), in purple, and the 12%-paying (and private equity–focused) BlackRock Science and Technology Term Trust (BSTZ), in orange. The benchmark index fund, QQQ, is in blue BST Total Returns Looking at this, you might feel dissatisfied that BST underperformed the NASDAQ 100—could that suggest this CEF isn’t worth buying now? Before jumping to this conclusion, remember that we’re looking at the total return–based market prices here (or the returns based on these funds’ prices on the stock market, including dividends). If we look deeper, at our two CEFs’ total return–based net asset values (NAV, or the value of their underlying portfolios, including dividends received), we see that BST more or less matched the index (while returning a big slice of its gain in cash, thanks to its high dividend), while BSTZ actually trailed a bit: Total Return on NAV It makes sense that BSTZ is slightly behind when looking at these funds based on their portfolios, rather than their market prices, as this fund holds a large portion of private-equity assets that are still lagging as their recovery takes longer to realize. This chart also suggests BST, which sports an 8% discount to NAV (or the gap between its market price and NAV), is a great buy now. But more crucially, both BST and BSTZ have an advantage over the NASDAQ 100 that is now becoming increasingly valuable: They aren’t directly exposed to crypto. Unlike the NASDAQ 100, neither fund has a position in MSTR, and they don’t invest in other volatile crypto firms, either. So if we see 2025 turn into a repeat of 2022 for cryptocurrencies, BST and BSTZ should fare much better than the index. And even if that doesn’t happen, the risks of a NASDAQ downturn are still likely to have a much lesser impact on these well-managed funds.

Latest AI Amazon Apps Biotech & Health Climate Cloud Computing Commerce Crypto Enterprise EVs Fintech Fundraising Gadgets Gaming Google Government & Policy Hardware Instagram Layoffs Media & Entertainment Meta Microsoft Privacy Robotics Security Social Space Startups TikTok Transportation Venture Events Startup Battlefield StrictlyVC Newsletters Podcasts Videos Partner Content TechCrunch Brand Studio Crunchboard Contact Us No company has capitalized on the AI revolution more dramatically than Nvidia. Its revenue, profitability, and cash reserves have skyrocketed since the introduction of ChatGPT a little over two years ago — and the many competitive generative AI services that have launched since. And its stock price soared more than eightfold. During that period, the world’s leading high-performance GPU maker has used its ballooning fortunes to significantly increase investments in all sorts of startups but particularly in AI startups. The chip giant ramped up its venture capital activity in 2024, participating in 49 funding rounds for AI companies, a sharp increase from 34 in 2023, according to PitchBook data. It’s a dramatic surge in investment compared to the previous four years combined, during which Nvidia funded only 38 AI deals. Note that these investments exclude those made by its formal corporate VC fund, NVentures, which also significantly ramped up its investing in the last two years. (PitchBook says NVentures engaged in 24 deals in 2024, compared to just 2 in 2022.) Nvidia has stated that the goal of its corporate investing is to expand the AI ecosystem by backing startups it considers to be “game changers and market makers.” Of course, Nvidia is not the only large tech corporation writing checks to AI startups. But over the last two years, it was the most active. Compared to Nvidia’s 83 deals in two years (2023 and 2024), Alphabet participated in 73, while Microsoft has done 40 rounds, PitchBook data shows. Below is a list of startups that raised rounds exceeding $100 million over the past two years where Nvidia is a named participant, organized from the highest amount to lowest raised in the round. OpenAI: Nvidia backed the ChatGPT maker for the first time in October, reportedly writing a $100 million check toward a colossal $6.6 billion round that valued the company at $157 billion. The chipmaker’s investment was dwarfed by OpenAI’s other backers, notably Thrive, which according to the New York Times invested $1.3 billion. xAI: Nvidia participated in the $6 billion round of Elon Musk’s xAI. The deal revealed that not all of OpenAI’s investors followed its request to refrain from backing any of its direct competitors. After investing in the ChatGPT maker in October, Nvidia joined xAI’s cap table a few months later. Inflection: One of Nvidia’s first significant AI investments also had one of the most unusual outcomes. In June 2023, Nvidia was one of several lead investors in Inflection’s $1.3 billion round, a company founded by Mustafa Suleyman, who earlier founded DeepMind. Less than a year later, Microsoft hired Inflection AI’s founders, paying $620 million for a non-exclusive technology license, leaving the company with a significantly diminished workforce and a less defined future. Wayve: In May, Nvidia participated in a $1.05 billion round for the U.K.-based startup, which is developing a self-learning system for autonomous driving. The company is testing its vehicles in the U.K. and the San Francisco Bay Area. Scale AI: In May 2024, Nvidia joined Accel and other tech giants Amazon and Meta to invest $1 billion in Scale AI, which provides data-labeling services to companies for training AI models. The round valued the San Francisco-based company at nearly $14 billion. Crusoe: A startup building data centers reportedly to be leased to Oracle, Microsoft, and OpenAI raised $686 million in late November, according to an SEC filing. The investment was led by Founders Fund, and the long list of other investors included Nvidia. Figure AI: In February, AI robotics startup Figure raised a $675 million Series B from Nvidia, OpenAI Startup Fund, Microsoft, and others. The round valued the company at $2.6 billion. Mistral AI: Nvidia invested in Mistral for the second time when the French-based large language model developer raised a $640 million Series B at a $6 billion valuation in June. Cohere: In June, Nvidia invested in Cohere’s $500 million round, a large language model provider serving enterprises. The chipmaker first backed the Toronto-based startup a year prior. Perplexity: Nvidia first invested in Perplexity in November of 2023 and has participated in every subsequent round of the AI search engine startup, including the $500 million round in December, which values the company at $9 billion, according to PitchBook data. Poolside: In October, the AI coding assistant startup Poolside announced it raised $500 million led by Bain Capital Ventures. Nvidia participated in the round, which valued the AI startup at $3 billion. CoreWeave: Nvidia invested in the AI cloud computing provider in April 2023, when CoreWeave raised $221 million in funding. Since then, CoreWeave’s valuation has jumped from about $2 billion to $19 billion, and the company reportedly has its sights on a $35 billion IPO this year. CoreWeave allows its customers to rent Nvidia GPUs on an hourly basis. Sakana AI: In September, Nvidia invested in the Japan-based startup, which trains low-cost generative AI models using small datasets. The startup raised a massive Series A round of about $214 million at a valuation of $1.5 billion. Imbue: The AI research lab that claims to be developing AI systems that can reason and code raised a $200 million round in September 2023 from investors, including Nvidia, Astera Institute, and former Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt. Waabi: In June, the autonomous trucking startup raised a $200 million Series B round co-led by existing investors Uber and Khosla Ventures. Other investors included Nvidia, Volvo Group Venture Capital, and Porsche Automobil Holding SE. Ayar Labs: In December, Nvidia invested in the $155 million round of Ayar Labs, a company developing optical interconnects to improve AI compute and power efficiency. This was the third time Nvidia backed the startup. Kore.ai: The startup developing enterprise-focused AI chatbots raised $150 million in December of 2023. In addition to Nvidia, investors participating in the funding included FTV Capital, Vistara Growth, and Sweetwater Private Equity. Weka: In May, Nvidia invested in a $140 million round for AI-native data management platform Weka. The round valued the Silicon Valley company at $1.6 billion. Runway: In June of 2023, Runway, a startup building generative AI tools for multimedia content creators, raised a $141 million Series C extension from investors, including Nvidia, Google, and Salesforce. Bright Machines: In June 2024, Nvidia participated in a $126 million Series C of Bright Machines, a smart robotics and AI-driven software startup. Enfabrica: In September 2023, Nvidia invested in networking chips designer Enfabrica’s $125 million Series B. Although the startup raised another $115 million in November, Nvidia didn’t participate in the round. Editor’s note: Previous version of this story incorrectly stated that Nvidia is a backer of Safe Superintelligence and an investor in Vast Data’s Series E round. Nvidia hasn’t invested in Vast Data since the company’s Series D.

Title: Meta's chief legal officer Jennifer Newstead sells $571,552 in stock

Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) recently saw a significant stock transaction by its Chief Legal Officer, Jennifer Newstead. According to a Form 4 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Newstead sold 905 shares of Meta's Class A Common Stock on January 7, 2025. The shares were sold at a price of $631.55 each, amounting to a total sale value of $571,552. The transaction comes as Meta trades near its 52-week high of $638.40, with InvestingPro data showing the company maintains a "GREAT" financial health score. Following this transaction, Newstead retains ownership of 32,010 shares in the company. The sale was conducted under a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, which was adopted on November 30, 2023, as noted in the filing. With Meta's market capitalization now at $1.56 trillion and its next earnings report scheduled for January 29, investors can access comprehensive analysis and additional insights through InvestingPro's detailed research reports, which cover over 1,400 US stocks. In other recent news, the U.S. Supreme Court is currently hearing arguments regarding a potential ban or sale of TikTok, a move that could significantly impact companies like Meta and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL). Analysts from Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) suggest that Meta and YouTube could benefit from such a ban, as users would likely redirect their time to these platforms. However, Oracle, which hosts TikTok, could see a loss in revenue, as estimated by Evercore ISI analysts. In recent developments, Meta has been initiated with a Buy rating by China Merchants Securities, citing the company's strong profitability and potential for further growth through AI applications. Meta's efforts to monetize features such as Threads and WhatsApp are expected to contribute to its revenue. Furthermore, Meta has announced a trial to allow users in Germany, France, and the U.S. to browse eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) listings on Facebook Marketplace. This move follows a ruling by the European Union that the link between Meta's classified-ads service and its main social network was undermining competition. In addition, Meta has announced a significant shift in its content moderation policy, transitioning from a U.S. fact-checking program to a community-based system. This change is similar to a model used by Elon Musk's X, formerly Twitter, and aims to reduce errors and instances of censorship, reinstating its foundational principles of free expression. Lastly, Meta has expanded its board of directors, welcoming Dana White, CEO of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, John Elkann, CEO of Exor (AS:EXOR), and Charlie Songhurst, a seasoned technology investor. These recent developments reflect Meta's ongoing efforts to adapt and lead in the competitive tech industry. This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

Title: Meta Stock Rallies, Oracle Slides As Market Reacts To TikTok Ban Hearing At Supreme Court

The Supreme Court’s signaling it may uphold a ban on TikTok, the wildly popular shortform video social media app, sent shockwaves through the stock market Friday, boosting shares of companies behind rival platforms and hitting hard one key TikTok partner. Protestors stand outside of the Supreme Court on Friday. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments Friday in TikTok’s appeal against a law requiring its private Chinese parent company ByteDance to divest its TikTok holdings by or face a U.S. ban Jan. 19, and several justices cast doubt on the legitimacy of TikTok’s argument. In an otherwise down day for U.S. stocks – the S&P 500 fell more than 1.5% to a two-month low and the tech-heavy Nasdaq was down 1.6% – two of the biggest stock gainers were a pair of American social media companies behind other short-form video platforms in Snapchat parent Snap, which owns TikTok competitor Spotlight, and Meta, which operates TikTok rival Instagram Reels. Snap stock gained 4% by close, notching its highest intraday share price since Aug. 1, while shares of the much larger Meta rallied 1%. Shares of Google parent Alphabet, which owns YouTube Shorts, were less affected by the TikTok hearing, dropping 1.1%, though that was a slimmer loss than the at least 1.4% losses experienced by stocks of Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft and Amazon, the world’s only other $2 trillion companies. $1.5 billion. That’s how much richer Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg got thanks to Friday’s rally, the biggest daily jump of any American billionaire, according to Forbes’ real-time net worth tracker. Friday was a rough day for perhaps TikTok’s most notable American collaborator, software giant Oracle, whose stock tanked 5%, the worst daily loss of any of the U.S.’ 40 mega-cap companies worth at least $200 billion. Shares of Oracle hit their lowest price since early September. Oracle, which hosts the U.S. data of TikTok, cautioned in July its earnings would take a hit if TikTok got banned. Oracle’s cofounder and chairman, Larry Ellison, was the biggest billionaire loser Friday, as his net worth tanked $10 billion. Betting markets have moved heavily in favor of a TikTok ban: The odds of a TikTok ban by May have jumped from 30% to 70% over the last week on the blockchain-based site Polymarket. Meta and Oracle’s opposite fortunes widened the net worth gap between Zuckerberg, the world’s third-richest person, and Ellison, the fourth-wealthiest, to nearly $20 billion, just two days after Zuckerberg’s riches surpassed Ellison’s. ByteDance last fetched a $220 billion valuation in a 2023 funding round and valued itself internally at $300 billion in November, according to Reuters, which would make it the world’s second-most valuable private company, trailing only SpaceX, which valued itself at $350 billion in an internal share sale last month, Bloomberg reported.

Title: How Elon Musk’s xAI is quietly taking over X
URL: https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/10/24339249/elon-musk-xai-x-twitter
Time Published: 2025-01-10T18:16:09Z
Full Content:
By Kylie Robison, a senior AI reporter working with The Verge's policy and tech teams. She previously worked at Fortune Magazine and Business Insider. When Elon Musk launched his own AI startup, xAI, he touted a key advantage over his competitors: access to the vast trove of data from his newly acquired social media platform Twitter. By implementing new API fees on the network he quickly renamed X, Musk locked out other AI companies, maintaining exclusive access for his own models. And he began using X’s millions of users to test the results. Musk has been using this distribution channel since xAI launched its first version of the Grok large language model, adding features like trending story summaries and AI-generated questions on posts as well as releasing the Grok chatbot (initially) to X users exclusively. Now, a slew of new AI features is coming. Per the findings of reverse engineer Nima Owji, the platform appears to be developing AI-powered post enhancements, including a feature that lets Grok modify your tweets. The chatbot also appears to be adding location-based queries, letting users ask about things nearby, like grocery stores. xAI’s takeover of the platform once known as Twitter is so unmistakable that even its branding has crept into X’s most visible real estate, with “xAI Grok” now commanding prominent placement in the app’s main toolbar — a striking symbol of how Musk’s AI ambitions have come to dominate the social network. An xAI employee poked fun at their company’s expanding presence, sharing an image of X’s timeline overrun with the xAI logo. xAI and X have perhaps the closest and most complex relationship of all of Musk’s companies. On paper, all xAI staffers are also X employees (but not the other way around); on top of access to the code base, they have company laptops from X and appear in the platform’s Workday HR software as X employees. After X vacated its flagship San Francisco HQ in September, the staffers moved into xAI HQ at the Stanford Research Park in Palo Alto. X offers xAI an instant pipeline to millions of users — far more efficient than building Grok’s audience from scratch. With xAI’s newly acquired Colossus cluster of 100,000 GPUs, deploying AI features across X has also become more technically feasible. Musk has a history of creating intertwined, interdependent companies. Tesla and SpaceX share engineering expertise, for instance, and after Musk acquired Twitter, Tesla and Boring Company teams were a common sight in its offices. Proponents of Musk consider this a genius strategic advantage. Critics argue that the intricate relationships between his ventures could create conflicts of interest, blur the lines of accountability, and expose the companies to shared vulnerabilities. On paper, all xAI staffers are also X employees (but not the other way around) The relationship between X and xAI is complex, with varying levels of collaboration between their teams, sources tell The Verge. While Musk holds separate meetings with both X and xAI engineers, the extent of day-to-day cooperation between the companies remains unclear. For six months, xAI brought on ex-Meta and Discord product leader Nikita Bier to guide AI implementation on X’s platform, including the addition of AI-generated questions to posts — notably, Bier worked exclusively with xAI, rarely engaging with X’s team. (Before Grok’s release, X had considered building its own generative AI team under Musk’s cousin James). Some talent does flow between the companies — LinkedIn shows xAI recruited two X engineers in September. The funding raised for xAI is separate from what is raised for X, a setup that highlights their stark difference in value. xAI has seen meteoric growth, reportedly securing a $50 billion valuation and effectively doubling its worth in mere months. Meanwhile, X has struggled to maintain value. Its most recent employee stock grants in October 2023 valued the company at $19 billion, less than half of Musk’s $44 billion purchase price. X employees, who received RSUs at $45 per share, have been waiting over a year for new stock grants while watching their sister company’s valuation soar. During xAI’s first funding round, Musk said investors in X would own 25 percent of xAI, but that hasn’t materialized for X employees who own X stock. And while xAI benefits tremendously from its link to X, it’s unclear whether X users have benefited much from xAI. Not long after X rolled out the Grok-powered Stories feature, it began spitting out garbage: it produced headlines that claimed Vice President Kamala Harris was shot after the attempted assassination of Donald Trump; misunderstood a bunch of shitposts about New York Mayor Eric Adams, saying he deployed 50,000 police officers to an earthquake; and erroneously claimed in an AI-generated headline “Iran Strikes Tel Aviv with Heavy Missiles.” (Grok, obviously, isn’t the only AI service with this problem.) Do you work at xAI or X? I’d love to chat. You can reach me securely on Signal @kylie.01 or via email at kylie@theverge.com. Despite the unconventional entangling of the two companies, it’s unlikely that the two will fully merge anytime soon. The ideology behind xAI is the familiar starry-eyed futurism that runs deep in the tech scene: open-source superintelligence, meteoric growth, and SpaceX-level dominance in AI (or, at least, that’s what Musk pitched at an xAI recruiting party a few months ago). It’s exactly the kind of audacious moonshot that makes Silicon Valley’s top talent and deepest pockets lean forward in their chairs. Meanwhile, at X, some staffers joke that they’re no longer Musk’s favorite child. That much is clear in the product. His dream of making it into an “everything app” has failed to materialize, the plans to launch payment features have stalled, advertisers continue to flee from Musk’s controversies, and upstarts like Bluesky and Threads threaten X’s dominance. The separation keeps Silicon Valley’s newest moonshot untethered from the messy reality of running a social network. The platform Musk claims he bought to protect free speech now seems to serve a different purpose entirely: a private testing ground for his AI ambitions. It’s an unconventional arrangement. But it seems to suit Musk perfectly. / Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly. The Verge is a vox media network © 2025 Vox Media, LLC.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. US stocks plunged on Friday as investors digested the final jobs report of 2024. The data blew past expectations on hiring, raising more uncertainty about the path of interest rates this year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) sank about 1.6%, or close to 700 points, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) also fell 1.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) tumbled 1.6%. The three major gauges erased all year-to-date gains with Friday's pullback. The Dow lost 1.1% for the week, the S&P gave up 0.7%, and the Nasdaq decreased by 0.6%. The December nonfarm payrolls report showed a very healthy labor market: The US economy added over 250,000 jobs in the month, while the unemployment rate fell to 4.1%. That's the good news. The less good news is that the strong reading could prompt the Fed to keep rates higher for longer, some on Wall Street believe. The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) continued a recent uptick on Friday, moving closer to 4.8% to touch its highest levels since late 2023. Investors were also hit with fresh data that showed consumers are more pessimistic about future pricing pressures. According to a new reading Friday from the University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index, year-ahead inflation expectations rose from 2.8% last month to 3.3% this month. The current reading is the highest since May 2024. Long-run inflation expectations also ticked up from 3% in December to 3.3% in January. In recent days, Fed Chair Jerome Powell and other officials have made it clear they're slowing down on lowering rates. Amid that tone and after the jobs showing, markets are pricing in no easing before July, per the CME FedWatch Tool. Meanwhile, investors welcomed a clutch of upbeat earnings to start the year. Walgreens (WBA) posted a first quarter profit beat, a sign the healthcare company's turnaround efforts are paying off. Shares rose over 20%. Delta (DAL) stock jumped more than 9% after a record year for travel fueled a fourth quarter profit beat and record annual revenue. The big banks are scheduled to post earnings next week. Wall Street traders have pushed back the prospects of another rate cut from the Fed after a surprisingly strong jobs report flashed signs that the economy is humming along. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) sank about 1.6%, or close to 700 points, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) also fell 1.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) tumbled 1.6%. The three major gauges erased all year-to-date gains with Friday's pullback. The Dow lost 1.1% for the week, the S&P gave up 0.7%, and the Nasdaq decreased by 0.6%. Meanwhile, the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) continued an uptick on Friday, moving closer to 4.8% to touch its highest levels since late 2023. Some on Wall Street have even rekindled conversations of a potential rate hike this year, especially as shifts in economic policy could reverse or stall progress on easing price pressures. Fresh jobs data Friday threw the Fed's interest rate policy back into the spotlight. Signs of a robust labor market shut the door on a rate cut to start the year. And it pushed back expectations of 2025's first cut from May to July, according to the CME Fedwatch tool. But strong jobs data is only part of the equation. Next week investors will get a fresh check on inflation. Wednesday will bring CPI data and potentially more signs that a hold on rate cuts will be the Fed's position for some time. On the corporate front, the big banks are on deck to post quarterly results. JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS), Bank of America (BAC), and Morgan Stanley are set to report, offering insights into credit conditions and spending heading into the new year. Yahoo Finance's Brent Sanchez has a graphical breakdown of what to watch next week: TikTok is having its day in court. The Chinese-owned social media company delivered oral arguments on Friday in a bid to overturn the law that is set to ban the company from operating in the US unless it finds a new owner. The high court could issue a decision before Trump is sworn into office on Jan. 20 or put the law on hold. In initial reports of the oral arguments, several Supreme Court justices seemed more sympathetic to the government's case, that TikTok presents a national security threat because of its ties to the Chinese government. And justices appeared to cast doubt on TikTok's position, that the company is being singled out in an assault on free speech protections. A ruling from the Supreme Court to uphold the ban could be a boon for TikTok's social media rivals by redistributing advertising dollars to platforms like Meta (META). Here are some of the stocks leading Yahoo Finance’s trending tickers page during afternoon trading on Friday: Delta Air Lines (DAL): Shares of the major airline rose after exceeding analyst expectations for both revenue and earnings in its fiscal fourth quarter, capping off a record-breaking revenue year in 2024. Delta shares rose more than 8% Friday afternoon. Nvidia (NVDA): The AI chipmaker fell Friday along with other chip names after a December jobs report pushed out expectations for additional rate cuts from the Federal Reserve and ahead of an expected chip export restriction from the Biden administration. Nvidia stock fell more than 2% in afternoon trading, while industry peer AMD (AMD) fell over 4%. Meta (META): The social media company rose 3% Friday afternoon following the conclusion of oral arguments before the Supreme Court on the fate of TikTok's US operations. The competitor to Facebook and other US-based social media sites is on track to be banned Jan. 19 unless its Chinese parent company sells TikTok. Initial reporting on the Supreme Court case indicated a majority of justices appeared ready to uphold the ban. Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA): The pharmacy chain surged nearly 30% Friday afternoon after beating Wall Street estimates on its adjusted earnings per share and sales for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025, even as questions remain about its future as a public company. The company reported $39.5 billion in revenue for the quarter, up 7% from the same quarter last quarter and above Bloomberg consensus estimates of $37.3 billion. A surprisingly strong December Jobs report dashed hopes that the Fed will cut interest rates anytime soon as signs of a robust economy feed into a posture of "higher for longer" at the US central bank. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) sank about 1.6%, or over 600 points, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell 1.6%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) tumbled 1.8%. The three major gauges erased all year-to-date gains with Friday's pullback. Odds of a rate cut in March fell to around 25% following the data release, down from about 44% a day ago, according to the CME Fedwatch tool. Fed officials have already expressed concern with sticky inflation, giving them more reasons to approach interest rate policy with caution. Alongside pricing pressure expectations from the trade and immigration policies of the incoming Trump administration, the latest data likely spells a longer period with no rate cuts. Homebuilder stocks sank as the stronger-than-expected jobs report raised investor concerns that interest rates will remain higher for longer this year. The SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) fell nearly 2% Friday. DR Horton (DHI), the biggest US homebuilder; Lennar (LEN); and PulteGroup (PHM) dropped roughly 1%, 2%, and 1%, respectively. High mortgage rates have kept many potential homebuyers and sellers on the sidelines. The rate on 30-year mortgages has been inching closer to 7% for the fourth consecutive week, according Freddie Mac. Following the latest jobs report, markets are now anticipating no Fed easing before July, per the CME FedWatch Tool. While the Fed doesn't set mortgage rates, its decisions influence them. Builders have also been under pressure from rising material and labor costs, with the latest employment picture showing a slowdown in construction job growth. Data from the Labor Department showed that construction firms added 8,000 jobs in December, down from 10,000 jobs added in November. The blowout jobs report is the biggest culprit for stocks getting hammered right now — with an assist from worries about inflation. But in the background, a laundry list of other worries is adding to the gloom. A rundown of a few: And the most unsettling of all: uncertainty about Trump's sweeping policy agenda and its impact, especially tariffs. Oil jumped to as much as $80 per barrel, a three-month high on Friday as traders digested new sweeping energy sanctions by the US against oil producer Russia. West Texas Intermediate crude (CL=F) rose as much as 4% to rise above $77 per barrel, while Brent crude futures (BZ=F), the international benchmark price briefly hovered just above $80 per barrel. More than 180 vessels, insurers, and top Russian energy executives, as well as two major oil companies, were all named in the sanctions announced on Friday morning. "The United States is taking sweeping action against Russia’s key source of revenue for funding its brutal and illegal war against Ukraine,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement. Oil prices were already on an upward trend coming into 2025 with traders on edge over President-elect Donald Trump's policy toward producer Iran. Tehran currently produces more than 3 million barrels of crude per day. "News continues to filter in about a Trump [administration's] hard stance on Iran that may come very quickly," Dennis Kissler, senior vice president at BOK Financial, wrote in a note to clients on Friday. "Add in the Freezing temps across most of the US, along with shrinking storage numbers, and crude has now become a new 'fund favorite,'" he added. A hot jobs report makes it even more likely the Federal Reserve won’t cut rates at its first meeting of the year in January — or for the foreseeable future, as more evidence surfaces of a strong economy, reports Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger. "I think they are done here," Blake Gwinn, the head of US rates strategy at RBC Capital Markets, told Yahoo Finance on Friday. "That January cut was already nearly dead before this print," Gwinn added. "Now we are looking at that March print" — ahead of the Fed's second meeting of 2025. Fed officials were already concerned about signs of persistent inflation, citing that as a reason to move cautiously in 2025, along with expectations that the trade and immigration policies of the new Trump administration might provide more upward pressure. Read more about the Fed's next policy move here. Venu Sports, the planned sports streaming service from Disney's ESPN (DIS), Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), and Fox (FOXA), will no longer make a debut. “After careful consideration, we have collectively agreed to discontinue the Venu Sports joint venture and not launch the streaming service," the three companies said in a joint statement on Friday. "In an ever-changing marketplace, we determined that it was best to meet the evolving demands of sports fans by focusing on existing products and distribution channels." The move caps off a wild week for Venu after FuboTV (FUBO) settled all litigation related to the debut earlier this week. The news and sports streamer had filed an antitrust lawsuit against the platform's launch last year. The settlement coincided with an announcement that Fubo, an internet TV bundler, would join forces with Disney's Hulu + Live TV business. Separately, Disney will roll out an ESPN flagship streaming service service this fall. Fubo stock popped around 10% in early trading on Friday after surging 250% Monday on the heels of the Disney deal announcement. Fox and WBD shares fell on the news. Disney's stock traded flat. The "higher for longer" narrative just got a dose of strength on Friday. The nonfarm payrolls report showed a very healthy labor market: The US economy added over 250,000 jobs in December, while the unemployment rate fell to 4.1%. On its face, that's good news. But the fresh data also fed into a dilemma for Wall Street: A strong reading could prompt the Fed to nudge rates higher. US stocks pulled back at the open as investors digested the final 2024 jobs report, which blew past expectations on hiring, raising more uncertainty when the next rate cut will come. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) slipped roughly 0.5%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) shed 0.6%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell 0.9%, leading declines as the major gauges set up for weekly losses. The US economy added 256,000 jobs in December, the most in nine months and almost 100,000 more than Wall Street had expected as the labor market finished 2024 on a surprisingly high note. In December, the unemployment rate also fell to 4.1% from 4.2%. Revisions showed the unemployment rate never reached the high of 4.3% reported initially in November. Friday's report saw Treasury yields rise as investors continue to push back expectations for Fed rate cuts in 2025, with no cuts expected now before June. Stock futures turned lower following the report. It's jobs day.

Title: What's Driving The Roku Stock Rally?

POLAND - 2023/11/02: In this photo illustration, a Roku logo is displayed on a smartphone. (Photo ... [+] Illustration by Omar Marques/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) Roku stock surged by about 6% in Wednesday’s trading and remains up by about 12% since the beginning of January. This compares with streaming titan Netflix, which has seen its stock decline 2% year-to-date in 2025. The recent gains come as the company gave investors a peek into its Q4 results, indicating that it had reached 89.8 million streaming TV households worldwide as of the end of December while surpassing the 90 million mark as of the first week of January. This was up from 85.5 million households in Q3 and about 80 million households in Q4 2023, a growth of about 12.5% year-over-year. Roku also said that its streaming boxes and smart TVs are now in about half of all U.S. broadband households. The strong momentum in the user numbers bodes well for Roku’s high-margin platform business. As an aside, see Why Palantir Stock’s Slide Isn’t Over. Over Q3 2024, Roku’s revenue from its platform business, which includes subscription and advertising revenues, brought in over $908 million with gross profit for the segment rising to nearly $492 million. Engagement on Roku’s platforms has also been trending higher, as people pivot from linear TVs toward streaming. During Q3, streaming hours were 32.0 billion, up 5.3 billion hours compared to the year-ago period. Roku has the scope to scale up, given the company’s rich data sets relating to user behavior, ad performance, engagement, and demographic trends. Roku has been continuously loss-making in recent years, and the company is looking to cut costs aggressively. Over the first nine months of 2024, operating costs fell by about 17% driven by workforce and office space reductions carried out in 2023. Roku is also generating more cash. Free cash flow stood at over $157 million for the trailing 12 months. As the company’s past investments in R&D and product development start paying off, and as Roku’s business gains scale, it could boost margins meaningfully. See a scenario on how Roku stock can hit $200 Roku stock’s performance over the last 4-year period has been far from consistent, with annual returns being considerably more volatile than the S&P 500. While Roku stock has seen mixed growth over recent years, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark S&P 500 index over the last four year period; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and multiple wars, could ROKU face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a recovery? Roku stock trades at just about 3x estimated 2024 revenue, which is well below the double-digit multiples the stock traded at in 2021. That said, Roku faces challenges, too. Roku’s streaming service distribution business, which facilitates the subscription process for streaming services and earns commissions for the same, is seeing some headwinds as more streaming services, including Netflix, focus on selling more affordable, ad-supported plans as customers look for better value in a mixed economic environment. Moreover, Roku has to increasingly compete for advertising-related revenue with big technology players including Netflix, Meta, and Alphabet in the video market. We value Roku stock at about $78, which is marginally below the current market price. We will be revisiting our price estimate for the stock post-Q4 earnings.

Posted on January 10, 2025 by Fahad Hamid Leave a Comment Are you inexperienced with organizing your WooCommerce store? If yes, you likely want to ensure that the shop page aligns with your overall brand aesthetics. The default WooCommerce shop page might not match the look and feel you need to create a cohesive customer experience. This article will guide you through the essential steps to edit and customize your WooCommerce shop page quickly. You’ll learn what steps to take, including approaching them with the right tool stack. The WooCommerce shop page is the default page in a WooCommerce-powered WordPress website that displays all available products for sale. It acts as the storefront for an online shop, showcasing products in a grid or list format, along with essential details like prices, images, descriptions, and purchase options. By default, this page automatically pulls products from the WooCommerce product catalog and arranges them based on the settings (such as categories or tags). It can be further customized through themes, plugins, and custom coding to modify its layout, style, and functionality according to the specific needs of the online store. Customizing your WooCommerce shop page offers several advantages that can significantly impact your store’s performance and user experience. Here are some of the key benefits: Customization can help create a more effective, visually appealing, and user-friendly store. However, having a plan for your WooCommerce shop page is important. Before we introduce Divi as the solution, let’s explore the common methods that many store owners use to customize WooCommerce shop pages: It is important to have WooCommerce configured on WordPress before creating your WooCommerce shop page. Check out our WooCommerce settings guide, which provides step-by-step instructions for configuring each essential page. Once the configuration is done, we will add the products to our shop page and assign them categories. You can add products one by one or in bulk using a CSV file. In our case, we have added four demo products of different types (simple, grouped, external/affiliate, and variable). To add them individually, navigate to Products > Add New. In our case, we have added 12 products to our online store, but you can add as many as possible. Here is how the list of our shopping products before we start our customization process. Manage your product stock with WooCommerce’s inventory features, and check out our comprehensive guide on setting up shipping in WooCommerce. With the introduction of the WordPress block editor, customizing WooCommerce shop pages has become more accessible, especially for users who are not familiar with coding. WooCommerce blocks allow you to add, arrange, and customize various elements of your shop page directly within the editor. Using blocks, you can add product grids, buttons, product information, images, and even custom content. Go to Pages > All Pages and locate your WooCommerce shop page in the WordPress dashboard. If a shop page hasn’t been created, WooCommerce automatically assigns one when you set up the plugin. Click Edit to open the shop page in the block editor. Once you’re in the editor, you can add WooCommerce-specific blocks to your shop page layout. To display a grid of all products, click the + icon to add a block, search for “Products,” and select the All Products block. This block will automatically display all products in your WooCommerce store. You can customize the block’s appearance and functionality by adjusting the number of products per row and page. Moreover, you can sort products by popularity, rating, or date added. If you want to highlight a specific product, you can use the Featured Product block. After adding the block, search for the product you’d like to feature by name. It will then display with the product image, price, and ‘Add to Cart’ button. This is useful for drawing attention to special promotions or high-margin items. WooCommerce builders make it easy for everyone to create a custom shop page. For example, Divi has an extensive library of modules tailored explicitly for WooCommerce. These modules allow you to customize everything from product grids to category layouts. Divi’s real-time visual editor gives you complete control over every design aspect, making it easy to preview changes as you work. This level of customization enables you to create a truly unique shopping experience without needing advanced coding skills. Another standout feature of Divi is its responsive design options. It allows you to customize your shop page’s mobile, tablet, and desktop versions independently, ensuring a consistent and user-friendly experience across all devices. Divi also possesses powerful tools that make your work efficient. Divi Quick Sites provides access to a collection of pre-made WooCommerce starter sites, allowing you to build a fully-fledged online store in just a few minutes. On the other hand, Divi AI assists you in creating custom layouts tailored to your specifications. You can input your shop page requirements, and Divi AI will generate a personalized layout that matches your vision. Get Started with Divi We are focusing on creating and customizing a fully-fledged WooCommerce shop page. However, if you are a beginner and struggling to understand the dynamics of WooCommerce, you should go through our guide to setting up an online store. To kick start the tutorial, first and foremost, you need to ensure that you have Divi installed and activated on your WooCommerce store. Divi is available from Elegant Themes with an annual license priced at $89 or a lifetime license for $249. Once you’ve purchased the theme, download it and install it on your WordPress site by following these steps: Check out the video below for further details. Get Started with Divi Once the setup is finished, you’re all set to begin building. If you want to learn more before getting started, take a look at our tutorial on using the Divi Builder. With Divi’s Theme Builder, you can create a custom template for your WooCommerce shop page. Start by accessing the Theme Builder from the Divi menu, then add a new template specifically for the Shop page. Once the template is created, you’ll see options for adding a custom header, body, and footer. If you want to add the custom body, this action opens the Divi Builder interface. You can start designing the layout of your shop page. You’ll have the option to use Divi’s WooCommerce modules to build a unique layout, incorporating elements like product grids, filters, and custom headers. Once you’ve created the structure of your shop page, you can apply the template to ensure that the design is consistent every time someone visits your store. Divi makes it easy to create a fully customized WooCommerce shop page without starting from scratch. With Divi’s extensive library of WooCommerce Layouts, you can quickly select a professionally designed shop page template and tailor it to suit your brand. These layouts come with all the essential eCommerce elements in place, allowing you to build a shop page that looks polished and professional with minimal effort. Divi offers a variety of layouts specifically designed for online stores and shop pages, covering various styles and formats. Browse the layout options by filtering for eCommerce or WooCommerce-specific layouts. Choose one that aligns with your brand’s aesthetic and structure preferences. The layout library categorizes many premade designs by page type, including shop or product pages. Browse the available options and preview them to see how they look on your site. After importing the layout, you can customize each element to make it your own. Replace placeholder content with your actual product images, descriptions, and branding elements like colors and fonts. Divi’s WooCommerce modules let you dynamically pull product information, images, and prices from your WooCommerce store and display them in customized layouts. Divi’s built-in design options allow you to modify every element of your shop page without touching any code. Once you have used the pre-made layout, you can customize it by enabling the Divi Visual Builder. To display the WooCommerce products, Woo Product module is the focal point. The ordering of products is done as per default. However, if you want to make further changes to the product organization, you can check the module settings’ content tab. You can adjust the number of products per row, change the layout from grid to list, and choose to display products in terms of their categories. In our case, we will sort the ordering by showing three products per row. Divi also allows you to hide or display certain elements within your Woo Product module. For example, in our case, we have decided to hide the sale badge and product price. If the customers find their desired product, they will click on the product to get to the product page and get all their desired information. As a combination, we can focus on one particular product by using the Woo Product Tabs module. Here are the other Divi WooCommerce modules that you can use to customize your WooCommerce shop page: Each module can be tailored to suit your design preferences and functional needs, giving you total control over your online shop’s layout and features. To get an insight into every one of them, go through our documentation. Beyond the basic layout and WooModules, Divi also offers advanced features that allow for even more creative and functional customizations. These additional customization tips can help you unlock new possibilities for your WooCommerce shop page, improving both its aesthetic appeal and user experience. Divi also allows you to integrate WooCommerce product data dynamically into various modules. For example, the Countdown Timer Module can display dynamic content anywhere on your shop page. In our case, we want to make the occasion for Black Friday memorable by offering one WooCommerce product at a discount. Here are the steps involved to do this: This feature allows you to dynamically pull product information and place it anywhere on your shop page, giving you total control over its layout and design. Divi’s conditional display functionality allows you to show or hide certain elements on your shop page based on specific conditions, such as user behavior or product attributes. For example, suppose you return to the section dedicated to a sale with discounted prices. In that case, you can set a condition that it will only be shown to customers logged in to your website. The condition settings can be found in the advanced tab of the module, row, or section. Customer testimonials are a great way to build trust and encourage potential buyers to purchase. Divi’s Testimonial Module lets you easily display customer feedback and reviews directly on your WooCommerce shop page. After adding the module, input the customer’s name, review text, and other relevant information like purchased products or star ratings. It is important that your displayed testimonials comply with the theme of your shop page. For that, you can customize the display of your modules in the design tab of its settings. Email marketing is one of the most effective ways to keep your customers engaged and drive repeat business. With Divi, you can easily integrate email opt-ins on your WooCommerce shop page to capture leads and grow your mailing list. Email Opt-In Module allows you to integrate lead generation forms into your WooCommerce shop page easily. Divi also provides multiple shop page pre-made layouts that integrate email opt-ins. Hence, you can easily check them out and make necessary changes to match your branding.

Full Content:
UPDATED 06:33 EST / JANUARY 10 2025 BREAKING ANALYSIS by Dave Vellante Breaking Analysis is a weekly editorial program combining knowledge from SiliconANGLE’s theCUBE with spending data from Enterprise Technology Research. Branded as theCUBE Insights, Powered by ETR, the program is our opportunity to share independent, unfiltered editorial with SiliconANGLE, theCUBE and Wikibon communities. The program and conclusions we produce are data-driven, tapping ETR’s proprietary spending data set. Episode 221 – Nvidia, Broadcom and the expanding breadth of AI – We attended both Nvidia Corp.’s GTC conference and Broadcom Inc.’s investor day this week where the artificial intelligence platform shift was on full display. In our view, GTC24 was the most important event in the history of the technology industry, surpassing Steve Jobs’ iPod and iPhone launches. The event was not the largest but, in our opinion, it was the most significant in terms of its reach, vision, ecosystem impact and broad-based recognition that the AI era will permanently change the world. Meanwhile, Broadcom’s first investor day underscored both the importance of the AI era and the highly differentiated strategies and paths that Nvidia and Broadcom are each taking. We believe Nvidia and Broadcom are currently the two best-positioned companies to capitalize on the AI wave and will each dominate their respective markets for the better part of a decade. But importantly, we see them each as enablers of a broader ecosystem that collectively will create more value than either of these firms will in and of themselves. In this Breaking Analysis, we will share our perspectives on the state of AI and how Nvidia and Broadcom are each leading the way with dramatically different but overlapping strategies that may be headed for an eventual collision course. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 220 – Navigating NVIDIA & the AI Trade – Sell, hold or double down? – Heading into the second half of 2023, some investors felt that the semiconductor run up last summer was a harbinger for a broader tech rally. That thesis proved prescient and rewarded managers who took on risk at the time with leading firms in semiconductors, security and enterprise software. The question is, where do we go from here? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer at Spear Invest, Nasdaq SPRX. Some have compared SPRX to a miniature version of Cathie Wood’s ARKK fund. However SPRX is more sector agnostic where Delevska focuses more broadly on growth themes such as her current emphasis on cybersecurity, semiconductors, and enterprise software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 219 – Why CrowdStrike is separating from the cybersecurity pack – It’s been an interesting month in the cybersecurity space. The sector has been somewhat less affected by budget tightening these past twenty-four months and at the same time has benefitted from AI tailwinds. But in the past several weeks we’ve seen some separation in key highflying cybersecurity names. Specifically, Palo Alto shocked the street last month with a $600M billings forecast surprise and sounded the alarm that there were cracks in its consolidation execution. This dragged down other consolidation players in sympathy, namely CrowdStrike and Zscaler. But our research shows that the dynamics facing these three companies are quite different. Of particular note, CrowdStrike’s earnings print highlights the company’s impressive momentum while recent negativity around Zscaler is a bit of a head scratcher for us, which we’ll try to explain. In this Breaking Analysis we take a more narrow look at the information security space and dig deeper into the continued success of CrowdStrike. With recent survey data from ETR, we continue to advance our premise that platforms beat products and we identify several levers that are powering CrowdStrike’s path to $5B by FY 2026 and to $10B by the end of the decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 218 – The unplanned genius of Broadcom’s route to AI dominance – Broadcom is perhaps the most unique company in the technology business. It doesn’t simply chase markets that are on steep growth curves and can deliver short term ROI. Rather it goes after established markets with durable franchises. Broadcom focuses its R&D on serving customers in these markets with major engineering investments to achieve a dominant position in each of its target sectors. And sometimes, the company lucks out with this strategy and catches a wave accidentally by design. In this Breaking Analysis we extract key nuggets from our sit down at MWC this week with Charlie Kawwas, president of Broadcom’s Semiconductor Solutions Group, and we unpack the contrarian business technology model of Broadcom. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 217 – Cloud optimization wanes as AI slowly lifts off – The past twenty-four months have seen cloud spending face dual headwinds of macroeconomics and the ability to dial down resources as needed – i.e. cloud optimization. Nonetheless, the big four hyperscalers clocked in between $170 – $190B in IaaS and PaaS revenue last year depending on how you factor the leaked court documents suggesting Azure is much smaller than previously believed. Regardless, hyperscaler growth continued to outpace almost all markets, accelerating between 18-19% in revenue terms last year, despite their enormous size. As we progress into 2024, IT decision makers are cautiously optimistic about spending levels, especially for the second half. All hyperscalers report that cloud optimization is slowing although pockets of cloud cost cutting remain. While AI gets all the headlines, its contribution to revenue is still a small fraction of the overall spending pie. For example, we estimate that Microsoft’s AI services accounted for around $800M this past quarter. But the trajectory for AI services and the potential uplift looks promising for all four hyperscalers. We think collectively the generative AI uplift in cloud will surpass $10B this year. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on our latest hyperscale cloud spending and market share data. We’ll analyze the ETR survey data on cloud optimization, assess the Gen AI updraft for the big 3 US cloud players and look at some of the industry trend data on cloud spend by platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 216 – Intel Foundry is a bold bet filled with uncertainty – As an American, you can’t help but root for Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger to succeed. His vision to bring semiconductor manufacturing leadership back to the United States is more than just a quaint nationalistic sentiment. Rather it’s a strategic imperative for the country, its military, global competitiveness and access to future technological innovations in the AI era. But his strategy is dependent upon the success of Intel both as a designer and a leading manufacturer of advanced chips. As such this choice puts Intel in a multi-front war with highly capable leaders in several markets, including names like AMD, NVIDIA, AWS, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Tesla and other chip designers…even perhaps OpenAI. As well Intel competes with with established manufacturers like Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung. Moreover, Intel’s business model has been disrupted by Arm which has created a volume standard powered by the iPhone and mobile technologies. Finally, China, Inc. looms as a long-term competitor further underscoring the imperative. But the trillion dollar questions are: 1) What are the odds that Intel’s strategy succeeds; and 2) Are there more viable alternative strategies for both Intel and the United States? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 215 – Slicing the Gordian Knot – A leap to real time systems of truth – In order to support the vision of the sixth data platform, that is, a capability that allows a globally consistent, real-time, intelligent digital representation of a business, we believe the industry must rethink the single system of truth. Specifically, we envision a new data platform that marries the best of relational and nonrelational capabilities and breaks the multi-decades tradeoffs between data consistency, availability and global scale. Further, we see the emergence of a modular data platform that automates decision-making by combining historical analytic systems with transactions to enable artificial intelligence to take action. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome two innovators, Eric Berg, chief executive of Fauna Inc., and S. Somasegar, managing director at Madrona Ventures. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 214 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2024 – Predictions about enterprise tech have never been more uncertain. They become even more challenging when you try to make forecasts that are measurable. Generally, our belief is we should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true – ideally with some quantifiable evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis and for the third year in a row, we collaborate with Erik Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research and to share our annual enterprise technology predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 213 – 2024 IT spending outlook shows cautious start with optimistic finish – According to recent spending intentions data from over 1,700 information technology decision-makers, executives anticipate a 4.3% growth in technology budgets for the year, which is an improvement from the 3.5% growth seen in 2023 and higher than the 3.8% expectation from October. However, the forecasts for 2024 are back-loaded, with Q1 2024 forecasts at 2.4%, indicating that the optimism is concentrated in the second half of the year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 212 – Unifying intelligence in the age of data apps – We believe the future of intelligent data apps will enable virtually all organizations to operate a platform that orchestrates an ecosystem similar to that of Amazon.com. By this we mean dynamically connecting and digitally representing an enterprise’s operations including its customers, partners, suppliers and even competitors. This vision includes the ability to rationalize top down plans with bottom up activities across the many dimensions of a business – e.g. demand, product availability, production capacity, geographies, etc. Unlike today’s data platforms, which generally are based on historical systems of truth, we envision a prescriptive model of a business’ operations enabled by an emerging layer that unifies the intelligence trapped within today’s application silos. In this Breaking Analysis, we explore in depth, the semantic layer we’ve been discussing since early last year. To do so we welcome Molham Aref, the CEO of RelationalAI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 211 – Grading Our 2023 Enterprise Technology Predictions – Predictions about the future of enterprise tech are streaming to our inboxes, literally by the thousands. Most are thoughtful and we will review those prior to publishing our 2024 predictions later in January. As is our tradition, we try to make our own predictions more challenging by citing forecasts that are measurable and have either a numeric tied to them or a binary outcome. Our belief is if we make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With some empirical evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we grade the 2023 predictions we made with ETR’s Erik Bradley. We look back at what we said in January about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security, generative AI, cloud, blockchain, data platforms, automation and tech events. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 210 – David vs Goliath reimagined – OpenAI’s approach to AI supervision – Artificial general intelligence, or AGI, has people both intrigued and fearful. As a leading researcher in the field, last July, OpenAI introduced the concept of superalignment via a team created to study scientific and technical breakthroughs to guide and ultimately control AI systems that are much more capable than humans. OpenAI refers to this level of AI as superintelligence. Last week, this team unveiled the first results of an effort to supervise more powerful AI with less powerful models. While promising, the effort showed mixed results and brings to light several more questions about the future of AI and the ability of humans to actually control such advanced machine intelligence. In this Breaking Analysis we share the results of OpenAI’s superalignment research and what it means for the future of AI. We further probe ongoing questions about OpenAI’s unconventional structure which we continue to believe is misaligned with its conflicting objectives of both protecting humanity and making money. We’ll also poke at a nuanced change in OpenAI’s characterization of its relationship with Microsoft. Finally we’ll share some data that shows the magnitude of OpenAI’s lead in the market and propose some possible solutions to the structural problem faced by the industry. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 209 – Moving beyond separation of compute & storage…Journey to the 6th data platform – We believe today’s so-called modern data stack, as currently envisioned, will be challenged by emerging use cases and AI-infused apps that begin to represent the real world, in real time, at massive data scale. To support these new applications, a change in underlying data and data center architectures will be necessary, particularly for exabyte scale workloads. Today’s generally accepted state of the art of separating compute from storage, must evolve in our view to separate compute from data and further enable compute to operate on a unified view of coherent and composable data elements. Moreover, our opinion is that AI will be used to enrich metadata to turn strings (i.e. ASCII code, files, objects, etc.) into things that represent real world capabilities of a business. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our quest to more deeply understand the emergence of a sixth data platform that can support intelligent applications in real time. To do so we are pleased to welcome two founders of VAST Data, CEO Renen Hallak and Jeff Denworth. VAST just closed a modest $118M financing round that included Fidelity at a valuation of ~$9B, which implies a quite minor change to the cap table. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 208 – re:Invent ’23 underscores a new simplicity mandate for AWS – Generative AI has created a new mandate in enterprise tech with significant implications for all companies generally and AWS specifically. Amazon’s powerful playbook based on agility, developer choice, power, scale, reliability and security must now evolve to accommodate simplicity and coherence for mainstream customers. This imperative came into clear focus at AWS re:Invent ’23. AWS continues to innovate at a fast pace, but must now do so in a changing customer environment that increasingly values direct user productivity gains through software. In this Breaking Analysis we share our take on how AWS is navigating this challenge. We’ll review Amazon’s strategy to compete in the nascent Gen AI era and we’ll provide commentary on the chess moves it’s making with Anthropic, Nvidia and other partners to maintain its leadership position. We’ll also discuss the challenges of doing so as a $90+B giant in a fast-moving market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 207 – The OpenAI meltdown…Winners and losers in the battle for AI supremacy – Conventional wisdom says Microsoft is the big winner in the recent OpenAI saga. We don’t quite see it that way. Both Microsoft and OpenAI are in a worse position today than they were last Thursday, prior to the firing of OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and the ongoing public drama that ensues. Microsoft and OpenAI had a huge lead in market momentum, AI adoption and feature acceleration and were setting the narrative in AI. Our discussions with customers and industry insiders leads us to conclude that the duo has put its substantial lead at risk. While Satya Nadella is making lemonade from lemons, the window was just cracked open for the competition and it’s more clear than ever that one large language model will not rule them all. In this Breaking Analysis we weigh in on the impacts of the OpenAI meltdown with a deeper look at the customer perspective and how it alters the competitive landscape in the battle for AI supremacy. As well, the amazing data team at ETR has run a quick survey of OpenAI Microsoft customers to gauge reactions and we’ll share that fresh data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 206 – The copilot era takes flight at Microsoft Ignite 2023 – Microsoft Ignite 2023 was one part a celebration of yearlong technological innovations, one part announcing the general availability of previously announced products, one part vision, one part ecosystem and four parts copilots everywhere. Copilots promise an historic software-led productivity increase. Perhaps for the first time in industry history we’re seeing huge demand for software coincide with the ability to make it easier to write software. Just as AWS turned the data center into an API, copilots are turning software development into natural language, enabling many more people to create. The implications on productivity are massive and we believe will kick off a new wave of growth that will become increasingly noticeable throughout 2024. In this Breaking Analysis we give you our impressions of Microsoft Ignite 2023. theCUBE Research Analyst George Gilbert and CUBE Collective contributor Sarbjeet Johal both weighed in for this episode and we’ll also share some recent ETR data that shows the progression of some of the major AI players in the past twelve months and the the relative impact Gen AI has had on each of their businesses. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 205 – IBM turns the corner with Watson, why 2.0 is a breakthrough opportunity – With Watson 1.0, IBM deviated from the silicon valley mantra, fail fast, as it took nearly a decade for the company to pivot off of its original vision. In our view, a different dynamic is in play today with Watson 2.0 – i.e. watsonx. IBM’s deep research in AI and learnings from its previous mistakes, have positioned the company to be a major player in the Generative AI era. Specifically, in our opinion, IBM has a leading technological foundation, a robust and rapidly advancing AI stack, a strong hybrid cloud position (thanks to Red Hat), an expanding ecosystem and a consulting organization with deep domain expertise to apply AI in industry-specific use cases. In this Breaking Analysis we share our takeaways and perspectives from a recent trip to IBM’s research headquarters. To do so we collaborate with analyst friends in theCUBE Collective, Sanjeev Mohan, Tony Baer and Merv Adrian. We’ll also share some relevant ETR spending data to frame the conversation. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 204 – The Gen AI power law – How data diversity influences adoption – Our research indicates that the adoption of generative AI is occurring across a variety of frameworks with diverse deployment models, data sets and domain specificities. The transformative power of generative AI for industries is colossal, and we are convinced that AI will gravitate to where data lives. The power law of Gen AI, developed by theCUBE Research team, describes the adoption patterns we see emerging in the cloud, on-premises and at the edge with a long tail of highly specific domain models across every industry. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the Gen AI power law which informs how we see adoption happening within industries and organizations globally. We introduce new survey data from ETR that looks at some of the vendors being adopted or considered with a special peek into the emerging technology sector with data on Hugging Face, Anthropic, Cohere and Jasper. We also comment on the adoption of Meta’s Llama 2 and the potential impact of open source and other third parties on the shape of the curve. We share our estimates of Microsoft Azure’s AI revenue impact, which we see approaching a $2B run rate exiting 2023. Finally, we dig into the impact of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) using real world examples with some caveats of RAG implementations that practitioners should consider. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 203 – AI revenue riddle – Azure sees gains, when will other cloud titans see the surge? – In 1987, Nobel Prize-winning economist Bob Solow famously observed, “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.” This proclamation became known as the productivity paradox. Ironically, Solow’s statement preceded the greatest productivity boom since the dawn of the computer age which subsequently came to fruition in the 1990’s. It can be argued that a similar pattern is being seen today where AI is everywhere but generally not showing up in earnings numbers or productivity statistics…yet. In this Breaking Analysis we squint through the latest earnings reports from Microsoft, Alphabet and Amazon to understand what’s happening in cloud, evaluate the impact or lack thereof of AI on cloud earnings momentum and explain how we think about the future impact of generative AI and cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 202 – From hype to reality, the true state of AI adoption – MIT professor and economist Erik Brynjolfsson said recently that he’d be disappointed if AI didn’t lift the current anemic 1.2% productivity growth rate to 3% or even 4%. This would be a good thing for business and government as it could potentially help with the labor shortage, drive earnings growth and increase tax revenues, which would ostensibly help address current debt levels. This is one of the promised impacts of AI. While the hype surrounding Gen AI has narrowly propped up certain sectors of the market, like AI startups and the magnificent seven, the macro effects have not been felt thus far as adoption remains largely experimental. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Supercloud 4, ETR’s Erik Bradley and Daren Brabham join the program to share the latest trends on AI adoption, how Gen AI is being used, some of the deployment models and the AI leaderboard based on spending momentum and presence in the market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 201 – Get Ready for the Sixth Data Platform – In the next 3-5 years, we believe a set of intelligent data apps will emerge requiring a new type of modern data platform to support them. We refer to this as a sixth data platform. In our previous research we’ve used the metaphor “Uber for everyone” to describe this vision; meaning software-based systems that enable a digital representation of a business. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 200 – Lower for longer…Tech spending remains tepid – We’re getting used to the phrase, “higher for longer,” referring to the realization that interest rates are expected to remain elevated for a period of time. This trend is having an inverse effect on enterprise tech spending growth rates. Prior to the Fed’s tightening binge for example, IT decision makers (ITDMs) in aggregate expected annual technology spending to increase by 7.5%. Eleven fed interest rate hikes later, ITDMs estimate that their 2023 budgets will be up only 2.9%, with an expectation, or perhaps it’s a wishful hope, that their budgets will increase 3.8% in 2024. In this our 200th Breaking Analysis, we preview the current spending climate and where AI fits in relation to other sectors. We’ll also share with you a snapshot of the leaders in terms of spending velocity for their platforms; and how their performance compares to peers relative to earlier survey periods. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 199 – Cisco Splunk under the microscope, joint customers weigh in – In this special Breaking Analysis, theCUBE’s Dave Vellante talks with Enterprise Technology Research’s Erik Bradley as he shares the results of ETR’s recent flash survey assessing joint customer perceptions and likely spending actions as a result of the Cisco acquisition of Splunk. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 198 – Bob Muglia on Uber for everyone…how the future of data apps will evolve – The future of intelligent data applications: Uber for everyone. In June, we put forth our scenario about “Uber for all.” We believe a new breed of data apps is emerging and we used Uber as an example where data about people, places and things is brought together in a data-coherent, real-time system. In this special Breaking Analysis, analysts Dave Vellante and George Gilbert sat down with friend of theCUBE, entrepreneur, investor and software executive, Bob Muglia. Bob formerly worked at Microsoft, was the CEO of Snowflake and is a visionary trend spotter. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 197 – Cloud security powers CrowdStrike momentum, Gen AI is next – George Kurtz is pumped up…and why not? CrowdStrike’s business appears to be on a fast track and entering a new phase of growth, despite the difficult macro and elongated sales cycles. The company’s products are considered best in class, its business is growing steadily and an improved profitability and cash flow outlook had investors excited, at least up until this week. A still challenging environment and a rich 13X revenue multiple perhaps led to some profit taking, but Gen AI could be the next catalyst for the company. In the race to close the SecOps staffing gap, CrowdStrike has what appears to be a strong play with a natural language-based intelligent assistant known as Charlotte AI. In this Breaking Analysis we update our scenario on security leader CrowdStrike. We’ll review the company’s recent progress, share survey data that shows where it is strong and where there may be icebergs ahead. And we’ll preview Fal.Con 2023 which takes place next week in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 196 – Copilot or competitor – How gen AI bolsters and buffets UiPath’s Northstar – UiPath’s recent earnings beat and raise provides some evidence that thus far, Gen AI has not been dilutive for the company. As an early leader that is transforming beyond RPA toward end-to-end enterprise automation, UiPath, like all automation providers, has always faced adoption headwinds beyond isolated deployments. In this sense, Gen AI should bolster adoption and be a positive force. The flip side is that widely available tools like chatbots and generalized foundation models could eat away at the low end of the automation TAM, highlighting the urgency for companies like UiPath to move up market and accelerate innovation that brings differentiation from commoditized tools; and, importantly, create distance from embedded AI within mainstream enterprise SaaS platforms like Slack GPT and Salesforce Einstein. In this Breaking Analysis we briefly review the recent earnings print from UiPath. We’ll look at ETR survey data that shows Microsoft Power Automate’s impact on the automation market and how it is forcing UiPath to target larger accounts with a more functional product set. As well we’ll look at the impact that AI is having in these larger accounts and test UiPath management assertions that Gen AI will be a tailwind for the company. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 195 – Google goes all in on the AI cloud – At Cloud Next, Google showcased its strong leadership position in data and AI. In our view, Google’s messaging, demos and tech-centric narrative have broad appeal for developers and next generation startups. As well, the company’s focus on solutions, contrasts its strategy to the typically disjointed services we’ve seen from AWS over the past decade. Google also showed off an expanded ecosystem of GSIs and smaller CSPs, encouraging the broad use of Google’s kit globally. While Google remains a distant third in the Iaas/PaaS race, with revenue one-fifth the size of AWS, it is playing the long game and betting the house on AI as a catalyst to its cloud future. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the key takeaways from Google Cloud Next with Rob Strechay and George Gilbert. We’ll share ETR data that positions Google’s AI relative to other leaders and we’ll contrast Google’s data-centric strategy with traditional architectural models. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 194 – Snowflake has Momentum with AWS & Microsoft…Why Google may not be Next – Recent earnings prints from Amazon and Snowflake, along with new survey data, have provided additional context on top of the two events that Snowflake and Databricks each hosted last June. Specifically, we believe that the effects of cloud optimization are still being felt but are nearing the end of peak negative impact on cloud companies. Snowflake’s recent renewal with Microsoft better aligns sales incentives and should improve the company’s traction with Microsoft Azure, a platform that has long favored Databricks. Google however remains a different story as its agenda is to build out its own data cloud stack, rather than supporting Snowflake’s aspirations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 193 – VMware’s Future – Navigating Multi cloud Complexity & GenAI Under Broadcom’s Wing – The FTC continues to drag its feet on approving Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware. Ironically, in our view, these delays only hurt the very competitive environment the FTC claims to be protecting. The AI era is accelerating at a breakneck pace and the big 3 hyperscale cloud vendors already have a sizable lead on legacy incumbents. If preserving competition is truly the agenda of the U.S. government, it should recognize that VMware, its enterprise ecosystem and market forces have the potential to neutralize cross cloud complexity and give customers a viable alternative to increasingly powerful public cloud players. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of VMWare Explore 2023, we revisit our views on Broadcom’s rationale and likely actions post acquisition. We’ll share current ETR survey data to place VMware’s position in context to the major cloud players, speculate on its AI agenda and give a preview of next week’s VMware Explore. To do so we welcome CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and friend of theCUBE, Zeus Kerravala, principal of ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 192 – Cloud vs. On-Prem Showdown: The Future Battlefield for Generative AI Dominance – The data from enterprise customers is clear but conflicted. While 94% of customers say they’re spending more on AI this year, they’re doing so with budget constraints that will steal from other initiatives. As well, the choice of where customers plan to run generative AI is split almost exactly down the middle in terms of public cloud vs. on-premises/edge. Further complicating matters, developers report the experiences in the public cloud with respect to feature richness and velocity of innovation has been outstanding. At the same time, organizations express valid concerns about IP leakage, compliance, legal risks and cost that will limit their use of the public cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share the most recent data and thinking around the adoption of large language models and address the factors to consider when thinking about how the market will evolve. As always, we’ll share the latest ETR data to shed new light on key issues customers face balancing risk with time to value. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 191 – Tech Stocks Beyond the Magnificent Seven – After a tough 2022, the first half of 2023 has shown impressive strength paying off earlier technology bets. For sure investors in the so-called Magnificent Seven, i.e. Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla have been rewarded. But sharp investors have sought alpha beyond these names, riding the wave of secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure and software as well as other emerging spaces like cleantech and robotics. As we enter the second half of 2023, the run up in tech combined with macro uncertainty has many investors taking a cautious posture. But prudent earnings guidance sets up for a positive outlook in the mid-term, especially for those companies that can capitalize on the AI wave. In this Breaking Analysis we’re pleased to have back, founder and Chief Investment Officer of Spear Invest, Ivana Delevska to assess the current state of the market and explore how this investor is playing AI’s rising tide. We’ll also analyze ETR data to drill deeper into semis, cloud infrastructure, generative AI, cybersecurity and Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 190 – What Leaked Court Docs Tell us About AWS, Azure & Google Cloud Market Shares – Recently leaked court documents during the Microsoft Activision hearing require us to revisit our cloud forecasts and market share data. The poorly redacted docs, which have since been removed from public viewing, suggest that Microsoft’s Azure revenue is at least 25% lower than our previous estimates. As a result, we’ve cut and revised our Azure revenue figures which in turn increases AWS’ big 4 hyperscale cloud market share. Our new estimates show that AWS maintains a greater than 50% share of revenue through 2023. While the change also helps Google Cloud, its market share is only modestly affected. In this Breaking Analysis we update our hyperscaler cloud revenue estimates and market share data. We’ll also explain how the ETR data on cloud should be interpreted in this context and look forward to potential catalysts for cloud growth, including acceleration in Q4 attributable to generative AI. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 189 – AI gives cyber attackers the advantage…for now – Cloud complexity, tools sprawl and the AI awakening further tip the balance in favor of cyber attackers. Combined with corporate inertia, AI-washing, LLM inconsistency and the pace of change, we believe for now anyway, adversaries have the advantage over defenders. Moreover, macro spending headwinds continue to force organizations to make budget tradeoffs, not the least of which is how to fund AI experiments and deployments. Notably, however, 45% of organizations are using LLMs in production for use cases that may very well improve the productivity of SecOps teams in the long run and accelerate the cat and mouse game back to a state of quasi-equilibrium. In this Breaking Analysis we share key takeaways from Supercloud 3 – AI meets cloud security – and put forth new spending data from the latest ETR survey that shows which security firms are best positioned in the AI race to capitalize on the wave. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 188 – AI won’t be a winner takes all market – The AI heard ’round the world has put the machine intelligence sector back in the spotlight. But when you squint beyond the press hype, the data shows that artificial intelligence is now the number one sector in terms of relative spending velocity in the ETR taxonomy. Normally market hype leads deployments, but the data suggests that spending activity and market penetration for AI are coinciding with the hype. While hyperscale cloud players are reaping the rewards, we think this is a rising tide that’s going to lift all AI ships, those both plainly in sight and others that may not be so visible. In this Breaking Analysis we dig deeper into the AI space with spending data from ETR and one of the best minds in tech generally, and AI specifically, Jeff Jonas, CEO, founder, and chief scientist at Senzing. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 187 – Connecting the dots on the emerging Databricks tech stack – The recent Databricks Data+AI Summit attracted a large audience and, like Snowflake Summit, featured a strong focus on large language models, unification and bringing AI to the data. While customers demand a unified platform to access all their data, Databricks and Snowflake are attacking the problem from different perspectives. In our view, the market size justifies the current enthusiasm seen around both platforms but it’s unlikely that either company has a knockout blow for the other. This is not a head on collision. Rather Snowflake is likely years ahead in terms of operationalizing data. Developers can build applications on one platform, like Oracle when it won the market, that perform analysis and take action. Databricks likely has a similar lead in terms of unifying all types of analytic data – e.g. BI, predictive analytics & generative AI. Developers can build analytic applications across heterogeneous data, like Palantir today. But they have to access external operational applications to take action. In this Breaking Analysis we follow up last week’s research by connecting the dots on the emerging tech stack we see forming from Databricks. With an emphasis on how the company is approaching generative AI, unification and governance…and what it means for customers. To do so we tap the knowledge of three experts who attended the event, CUBE analysts Rob Strechay and George Gilbert and AI market maven Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 186 – Connecting the Dots on Snowflake’s Data Cloud Ambitions – Over the past several months we’ve produced a number of in-depth analyses laying out our mental model for the future of data platforms. There are two core themes: 1) Data from people, places, things, and activities in the real world drives applications, not people typing into a UI; and 2) Informing and automating decisions means all data must be accessible. That drives a change from data locked in application silos to application logic being embedded in a platform that manages an end-to-end representation of an enterprise in its data. This week’s Snowflake Summit further confirmed our expectations with a strong top line message of “All Data / All Workloads” and a technical foundation that supports an expanded number of ways to access data. Squinting through the messaging and firehose of product announcements, we believe Snowflake’s core differentiation is its emerging ability to be a complete platform for data applications. Just about all competitors either analyze data or manage data. But no one vendor truly does both. To be precise, managing data doesn’t mean running pipelines or serving analytic queries or AI/ML models. It means managing operational data so that analytics can inform or automate operational activities captured in transactions. With data as the application foundation, the platform needs robust governance. In this week’s Breaking Analysis, we try to connect the dots between Snowflake’s high level messaging and its technical foundation to better understand the core value it brings to customers and partners. As well, we’ll explore the ETR data with some initial input from the Databricks Data + AI Summit to assess the position and prospects of these two leaders along with the key public cloud players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 185 – HPE wants to turn supercomputing leadership into gen AI profits – HPE’s announcement of an AI cloud for large language models highlights a differentiated strategy that the company hopes will lead to sustained momentum in its high performance computing business. While we think HPE has some distinct advantages with respect to its supercomputing IP, the public cloud players have a substantial lead in AI with a point of view that generative AI is fully dependent on the cloud and its massive compute capabilities. The question is can HPE bring unique capabilities and a focus to the table that will yield competitive advantage and ultimately, profits in the space? In this Breaking Analysis we unpack HPE’s LLM-as-a-service announcements from the company’s recent Discover conference and we’ll try to answer the question: Is HPEs strategy a viable alternative to today’s public and private cloud gen AI deployment models, or is it ultimately destined to be a niche player in the market? To do so we welcome to the program CUBE analyst Rob Strechay and Vice President / principal analyst from Constellation Research, Andy Thurai. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 184 – Uber’s architecture represents the future of data apps…meet its architects – Uber has one of the most amazing business models ever created. The company’s mission is underpinned by technology that helps people go anywhere and get anything. The results have been stunning. In just over a decade, Uber has become a firm with more than $30 billion in annual revenue, an annual bookings run rate of $126B and a market capitalization near $90 billion today. Moreover, the company’s productivity metrics are 3-5 times greater than what you’d find at a typical technology company when, for example, measured by revenue per employee. In our view, Uber’s technology stack represents the future of enterprise data apps where organizations will essentially create real time digital twins of their businesses and in doing so, deliver enormous customer value. In this Breaking Analysis, we introduce you to one of the architects behind Uber’s groundbreaking fulfillment platform. We’ll explore their objectives, the challenges they had to overcome, how Uber has done it and why we believe their platform is a harbinger for the future. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 183 – Snowflake Summit will reveal the future of data apps…here’s our take – Our research and analysis points to a new modern data stack that is emerging where apps will be built from a coherent set of data elements that can be composed at scale. Demand for these apps will come from organizations that wish to create a digital twin of their business to represent people, places, things, and the activities that connect them, to drive new levels of productivity and monetization. Further, we expect Snowflake, at its upcoming conference, will expose its vision to be the best platform on which to develop this new breed of data apps. In our view, Snowflake is significantly ahead of the pack but faces key decision points along the way to its future to protect this lead. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit later this month, we lay out a likely path for Snowflake to execute on this vision; and we address the milestones and challenges of getting there. As always, we’ll look at what the ETR data tells us about the current state of the market. To do all this we welcome back CUBE contributor, George Gilbert. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 182 – Cisco needs to simplify…Here’s how – With a nearly $60B revenue run rate, growing at 14% and throwing off over $5B in operating cash last quarter, Cisco has an awesome business. But customers are vocal about the complexity of Cisco’s portfolio and if not addressed head on, the company risks encountering friction beyond just economic headwinds. We believe Cisco’s challenges are most decidedly not product breadth and depth, rather the company’s mandate is to integrate the piece parts of its intricate offerings to create more facile and seamless experiences for customers. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Cisco Live US, we dig deeper into Cisco’s business and double click on three key areas of its portfolio including: 1) Security; 2) Networking; and 3) Observability. With spending data from ETR and a guest appearance from SiliconANGLE contributor and market watcher Zeus Kerravala, principal at ZK Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 181 – The future of AI is real time data…Meantime GPUs are making all the headlines – The era of AI everything continues to excite. But unlike the Internet era, where any company announcing a dotcom anything immediately rose in value, the AI gods appear to be more selective. Nvidia beat its top line whisper number by more than $300M and the company’s value is rapidly approaching one trillion dollars. Marvell narrowly beat expectations this week but cited future bandwidth demand driven by AI and the stock was up more than 20% on Friday. Broadcom was up nearly 10% on sympathy with the realization that connect-centricity beyond the CPU is what the company does really well. Meanwhile, other players like Snowflake, which also narrowly beat earnings Wednesday and touted AI as a future tailwind, got hammered as customers dial down cloud consumption. In this Breaking Analysis we look at the infrastructure of AI examining the action at the silicon layer specifically around Nvidia’s momentum. Since much of AI is about data, we’ll also look at the spending data on two top data platforms, Snowflake and Databricks to see what the survey data says and examine the future of real time data and automation as a catalyst for massive productivity growth in the economy. To do so we have a special Breaking Analysis panel with John Furrier and David Floyer. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 180 – The AI powered hybrid multi super cloud – AI will now add superpowers to every triggering buzzword, hence the title of this week’s post. Look past the buzz and you’ll find substance somewhere. The spring conference season is kicking into high gear, so it’s a time to get serious and extract the signal from the event noise. This week we’ll see Microsoft Build, which will no doubt volley shots back from the messaging at Google I/O. Two other big events will take place this week, Red Hat Summit / Ansible Fest in Boston and the annual Dell Technologies World in Las Vegas. theCUBE will be covering both of these shows and we want to take this opportunity to update you on the state of hybrid multi-cloud…what we call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we examine some of the key infrastructure players in hybrid multi-cloud with a focus on Red Hat and Dell Technologies, two firms that increasingly are partnering with each other as VMware’s future evolves. We’ll share recent ETR survey data on the position of several other hybrid/cross-cloud players including Cloudflare, Equinix, HPE, IBM, Oracle, VMware and others. We’ll also share what we expect to hear at Red Hat Summit and Dell Technologies World this year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 179 – Searching for gold in enterprise AI – The AI gold rush is on. The paths to monetization are seemingly endless but the most obvious converge on making humans more productive or supercharging existing business models like search advertising or subscription licenses. Much of AI adoption in enterprise IT is hidden. Our research shows a very high overlap (around 40-60%) between AI adoption in enterprise tech and embedded AI inside software from the likes of Salesforce, ServiceNow, Workday, SAP, Oracle and other major players. But the rapid advancements of tools from AI leaders and an emerging group of independent firms is causing customers to think differently. Catalyzed by the OpenAI Microsoft partnership, organizations are rapidly trying to figure out how to apply these tools to create competitive advantage. Every firm on the planet wants to ride the AI wave. Virtually overnight, investment capital has shifted to fund early stage AI startups with much less funding required relative to previous boom cycles. In this Breaking Analysis we review ETR data to quantify the state of AI spending in the enterprise and look at the positions of several key players in the space that offer AI tools and platforms. To do so we invite Andy Thurai, CUBE contributor, VP and principal analyst at Constellation Research. Andy will help us unpack the hits and misses from this past week’s Google IO conference and give us his perspectives on what it takes to catch the AI wave and avoid becoming driftwood. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 178 – Desperately Seeking Cloud Repatriation – While we’ve been skeptical about repatriation as a notable movement, anecdotal evidence suggests that it is happening in certain pockets. Even though we still don’t see cloud repatriation broadly showing in the numbers, certain examples have caught our attention. In addition, the potential impact of artificial intelligence raises some interesting questions about where infrastructure should be physically located and causes us to revisit our premise that repatriation is an isolated and negligible trend. In this Breaking Analysis we look at a number of sources, including the experiences of 37signals, which has documented its departure from public clouds. We’ll also examine the relationship between repatriation and SRE Ops skill sets. As always we’ll look at survey data from our partners at ETR, a recent FinOps study published by Vega Cloud and revisit the Cloud Repatriation Index, which we believe is breaking a three-year trend. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 177 – Don’t be fooled by slowing cloud growth…cost optimization is a feature not a bug – The big three US cloud players all announced earnings this past week and, as expected, cloud growth is slowing. But don’t kid yourselves. Hyperscale clouds remain the epicenter of innovation in tech and foundation models like GPT will only serve to harden this fundamental fact. Our data suggests the deceleration in cloud spend is a function of two related factors: 1) Cautious consumption patterns; and 2) Aggressive cloud optimization, which is being promoted by the big three cloud vendors in an attempt to lock in customers to longer term commitments. There is still no clear evidence in the numbers that repatriation is a factor. Rather, the ability to quickly dial down spending and pause projects is an attractive feature of cloud computing and one that, until now, has never really been seen on a broad market basis. In this Breaking Analysis we try to explain the implications of this seemingly simple but nuanced dynamic. We’ll review the latest hyperscale cloud data for the big three players, share our analysis of certain comments made by cloud executives and show you the latest ETR data on spending and market presence in the cloud, Watch the full video analysis. Episode 176 – RSA 2023 Security Identity Crisis Part 2 – The narrative from security vendors is organizations don’t spend enough money on cyber defense. Maybe…but will spending more actually address the problems organizations face? The conventional wisdom is it will help; or at least it can’t hurt, but as we and others have pointed out over the years, a crowded market and mega VC funding have created more tools, more complexity and more billionaires…but are we safer? In this Breaking analysis we follow up last week’s episode and continue with Part 2. In an homage to the keynote from RSA CEO Rohit Ghai, we ask, is there a looming identity crisis in the security industry? This week we’re excited to introduce the newest member of the SiliconANGLE editorial team, long time journalist, David Strom. With David, we’ll unpack the data and bring additional context to the ETR body of work. We’ll also look at some recent data from Unit 42, Palo Alto’s threat intelligence and response division. As well, we’ll dig into the anatomy of a recent double supply chain hack. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 175 – RSA 2023 highlights an identity crisis in the age of AI – In this Breaking Analysis, theCUBE host Dave Vellante updates on the latest trends in the cybersecurity market and what to expect at the RSA Conference 2023. Join our real-time analysis coverage from #RSAC here: https://www.thecube.net/rsa-conference-2023 We’ll also share the latest Enterprise Technology Research spending data and drill into the areas of cybersecurity that are seeing the most action. As always, we’ll highlight those companies with the strongest (and weakest) momentum and close with a look at some of the emerging technology players in security that might be ripe for acquisition. To do all this, we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 174 – Hidden Gems from HPE GreenLake Storage Day – On Tuesday, April 4, HPE invited a number of industry analysts to participate in HPE GreenLake Storage Day. Notably, HPE declared 2023 the year of storage. While the company made several storage-related announcements, perhaps even more interesting was what the event tells us about HPE’s culture, its strategy and the future direction of the company. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share our takeaways from HPE’s event, held in Houston, Texas, which included attendance at Antonio Neri’s quarterly all-hands meeting. We’ll try to emphasize areas that have not necessarily been the focus of most press and industry analyst write ups to date. We’ll also take a look at the latest ETR survey data to put HPE’s market position in context across several of its major segments. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 173 – Semis rebound but enterprise tech spending remains soft – A rebound in semiconductor stocks has many investors asking if this is a harbinger of good news for the broader enterprise tech sector. Indeed the SOXX semiconductor ETF is up nearly 30% year to date as of this posting, as are bellwether fab suppliers like Applied Materials and Lam Research. Nvidia is up over 90% YTD and AMD over 50%. Even the beleaguered Intel is up 22%. But key enterprise software names have not yet rebounded and according to this week’s guest, the divergence between semis and B2B software is getting hard to ignore. In this Breaking analysis we examine the the bifurcation between the performance of semis and broader enterprise tech. And we’ll try to answer the question: Is the uptick in semiconductors an early indicator of a broader enterprise tech recovery, or is this a false signal that warrants continued caution? To examine these issues we welcome back Ivana Delevska, the founder and chief investment officer of SPEAR Invest.

Episode 172 – Which tech firms are most exposed to the banking crisis? – The viral awareness and adoption of foundation models like ChatGPT have created both an opportunity and threat to automation platforms generally and RPA point tools specifically. On the one hand, large language models can reduce complexity and accelerate the adoption of enterprise automation platforms. The flip side is software robots are designed to improve human productivity through intelligent automation and GPT models could cannibalize some, if not many use cases initially targeted by RPA vendors. This reality is causing customers to rethink their automation strategies and vendors to rapidly evolve their messaging to position foundation models as an accelerant to their platforms. In this Breaking Analysis we provide you with a perspective on how foundation models could impact automation platforms. We review ETR data that quantifies the ascendency of OpenAI. We also show survey data that measures the overlap between ML/AI systems and automation platforms. Then we review the recent quarterly performance of UiPath and share how we think the company must position itself with respect to the onslaught of noise and potential disruption from GPT models.

Watch the full video analysis. Episode 170 – Databricks faces critical strategic decisions…here’s why – When Apache Spark became a top level project in 2014, and shortly thereafter burst onto the big data scene, it along with the public cloud disrupted the big data market. Databricks cleverly optimized its tech stack for Spark and took advantage of the cloud to deliver a managed service that has become a leading AI and data platform among data scientists and data engineers. However, emerging customer data requirements and market forces are conspiring in a way that we believe will cause modern data platform players generally and Databricks specifically to make some key directional decisions and perhaps even reinvent themselves. In this Breaking Analysis we do a deeper dive into Databricks. We explore its current impressive market momentum using ETR survey data. We’ll also lay out how customer data requirements are changing and what we think the ideal data platform will look like in the mid-term. We’ll then evaluate core elements of the Databricks portfolio against that future vision and close with some strategic decisions we believe the company and its customers face. To do so we welcome in our good friend George Gilbert, former equities analyst, market analyst and principal at Tech Alpha Partners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 169 – MWC 2023 goes beyond consumer & deep into enterprise tech – While never really meant to be a consumer tech event, over time, the rapid ascendancy of smartphones captured much of the agenda at Mobile World Congress, now MWC. And while device manufacturers continue to have a major presence at the show, the maturity of intelligent devices, longer lifecycles and the disaggregation of the network stack have created more interest in enterprise-class technologies than ever before. Semiconductor manufacturers, network equipment players, infrastructure companies, cloud vendors, software providers and a spate of startups are eyeing the trillion dollar plus telecommunications industry as one of the next big things to watch this decade. In this Breaking Analysis we bring you part 2 of our ongoing coverage of MWC 2023. With some new data on enterprise players specifically within large telco environments. We’ll also take a brief glimpse at some of the pre-announcement news from the show and corresponding themes ahead of MWC. We’ll close with the key innovation areas we’ll be covering at the show on theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 168 – MWC 2023 highlights telco transformation & the future of business – The world’s leading telcos are often branded as monopolies that lack innovation. Telcos have been great at operational efficiency, connectivity and living off of transmission services. But in a world beyond telephone poles and basic wireless services, how will telcos modernize, become more agile and monetize new opportunities brought about by 5G, private wireless and a spate of new innovations in infrastructure, cloud, data, AI and apps? It’s become table stakes for carriers to evolve their hardened, proprietary infrastructure stacks to more open, flexible, cloud-like models. But doing so brings risks that telcos must carefully balance as they strive to deliver consistent quality of service while at the same time moving faster and avoiding disruption. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of MWC23, we explore the evolution of the telco business and how the industry is in many ways, mimicking a transformation that took place decades ago in enterprise IT. We’ll model some of the traditional enterprise vendors using ETR data and investigate how they’re faring in the telecomms vertical. And we’ll pose some of the key issues facing the industry this decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 167 – Google’s Point of View on Confidential Computing – Confidential computing is a technology that aims to enhance data privacy and security by providing encrypted computation on sensitive data in use and isolating data from apps and other host resources in fenced off enclaves. The concept of confidential computing is gaining popularity, especially in the cloud computing space where sensitive data is commonly stored and processed. However, there are some who view confidential computing as an unnecessary technology and a marketing ploy by cloud providers, aimed at calming customers who are cloud-phobic. In this Breaking Analysis we revisit the notion of confidential computing and explore whether it’s just marketing or a key part of a trusted security strategy. To do so we’ll invite two Google experts to the show. But before we get there let’s summarize the overall market climate briefly with some ETR data. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 166 – Cloud players sound a cautious tone for 2023 – The unraveling of market enthusiasm continued in Q4 of 2022 with the earnings reports from the U.S. hyperscalers now all in. As we said earlier this year, even the cloud is not immune from the macro headwinds and the cracks in the armor we saw from the data we shared last summer are playing out into 2023. For the most part, actuals are disappointing beyond expectations, including our own. It turns out that our estimates for the big 3 hyperscale revenue missed by $1.2 billion or 2.7% lower than we had forecast from our most recent November estimates. We expect decelerating growth rates for the hyperscalers will continue through the summer of 2023 and won’t abate until comparisons get easier. In this Breaking Analysis we share our view of what’s happening in cloud markets – not just for the hyperscalers but other firms that have hitched a ride on the cloud. And we’ll share new ETR data that shows why these trends are playing out, tactics customers are employing to deal with their cost challenges and how long the pain is likely to last. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 165 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2023 – Making predictions about the future of enterprise tech is more challenging if you strive to lay down forecasts that are measurable. In other words if you make a prediction, you should be able to look back a year later and say with some degree of certainty whether the prediction came true or not. With evidence to back that up. In this Breaking Analysis we aim to do just that with predictions about the macro IT spending environment, cost optimization, security – lots to talk about there – generative AI, cloud and supercloud, blockchain adoption, data platforms, including commentary on Databricks, Snowflake and other key players, automation, events and we may even have some bonus predictions. To make all this happen we welcome back for the third year in a row, Erik Bradley our colleague from ETR. As well, you can check out how we did with our 2022 predictions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 164 – ChatGPT Won’t Give OpenAI First Mover Advantage – OpenAI, the company, and ChatGPT have taken the world by storm. Microsoft reportedly is investing an additional $10B in the startup. But in our view, while the hype around ChatGPT is justified, we don’t believe OpenAI will lock up the market with its first mover advantage. Rather we believe that success in this market will be directly proportional to the quality and quantity of data that a technology company has at its disposal, and the compute power it has to run the system. This market is unlikely to display winner take all dynamics and will probably evolve in a more fragmented fashion than cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack the excitement around ChatGPT and debate the premise that the company’s early entry into the space may not confer “game over” advantage to OpenAI. To do so we welcome CUBE collaborator Sarbjeet Johal & John Furrier, cohost of theCUBE. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 163 – Supercloud2 Explores Cloud Practitioner Realities & the Future of Data Apps – Enterprise tech practitioners, like most of us, want to make their lives easier so they can focus on delivering more value to their business. They want to tap best of breed services in the public cloud and at the same time connect their on-prem intellectual property to emerging applications which drive top line revenue and bottom line profits. But creating a consistent experience across clouds and on-prem estates has been an elusive capability for most organizations, forcing tradeoffs and injecting friction into the system. The need to create seamless experiences is clear and the technology industry is starting to respond with platforms, architectures and visions of what we call Supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we give you a preview of Supercloud2, share key findings leading up to the event and highlight some of the areas we’ll be probing in the live program. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 162 – CIOs in a holding pattern but ready to strike at monetization – Recent conversations with IT decision makers show a stark contrast between the period exiting 2023 versus the mindset leaving 2022. CIOs are generally funding new initiatives by pushing off or cutting lower-priority items. While security efforts are still being funded, those that enable business initiatives that generate revenue take priority over cleaning up legacy technical debt. The bottom line is, for the moment at least, the mindset is not to cut everything, rather it’s to put a pause on cleaning up legacy hairballs and continue to fund initiatives to drive monetization. Cloud has become fundamental and getting data “right” is a consistent theme that appears to be an underpinning of initiatives getting funded today. In this Breaking Analysis we tap recent discussions from two primary sources: year-end ETR roundtables with IT decision makers and conversations on theCUBE with data, cloud and IT architecture practitioners. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 161 – AI goes mainstream but ROI remains elusive – A decade of big data investments combined with cloud scalability, the rise of more cost effective processing and the introduction of advanced tooling has catapulted machine intelligence to the forefront of technology investments. No matter what job you have, your operation will be AI powered within five years and machines may be doing your job in the future. Artificial intelligence is being infused into applications, infrastructure, equipment and virtually every aspect of our lives. AI is proving to be extremely helpful at controlling vehicles, speeding medical diagnoses, processing language, advancing science and generally raising the stakes on what it means to apply technology for business advantage. But business value realization has been a challenge for most organizations due to lack of skills, complexity of programming models, immature technology integration, sizable up front investments, ethical concerns and lack of business alignment. Mastering AI technology and a focus on features will not be a requirement for success in our view. Rather figuring out how and where to apply AI to your business will be the crucial gate. That means understanding the business case, picking the right technology partner, experimenting in bite sized chunks and quickly identifying winners to double down on from an investment standpoint. In this Breaking Analysis we update you on the state of AI with a focus on interpreting the latest ETR survey data around ML/AI and data. We’ll explore what it means for the competitive environment and what to look for in the future. To do so we invite into our studios Andy Thurai of Constellation Research. Andy covers AI deeply, he knows the players and the pitfalls of AI investment. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 160 – Grading our 2022 enterprise technology predictions – Nailing technology predictions in 2022 was tricky business. Projections on the performance of markets, identifying IPO prospects and making binary forecasts on data, AI, the macro spending climate, along with other related topics in enterprise tech, carried much uncertainty. 2022 was characterized by a seesaw economy where central banks were restructuring their balance sheets, the war in Ukraine fueled inflation, supply chains were a mess and the unintended consequences of digital acceleration are still being sorted. In this Breaking Analysis we continue our annual tradition of openly grading our previous year’s enterprise tech predictions. You may or may not agree with our self-grading system but we give you the data to draw your own conclusions. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 159 – How Palo Alto Networks Became the Gold Standard of Cybersecurity – Palo Alto Networks has earned a reputation as the leader in security. You can measure this in revenue, market cap, execution and, most importantly, conversations with CISOs. The company is on track to double its revenues to nearly $7B in FY23 from FY20. This despite macro headwinds which will likely continue through next year. Palo Alto owes its position to a clarity of vision and strong execution of a TAM expansion strategy bolstered by key acquisitions and integrations into its cloud & SaaS offerings. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of Palo Alto Ignite, we bring you the next chapter on top of last week’s cybersecurity update. We’ll dig into the ETR spending data on Palo Alto Networks, provide a glimpse of what to look for at Ignite and posit what Palo Alto needs to do to stay on top of the hill. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 158 – Cyber Firms Revert to the Mean – While by no means a safe haven, the cybersecurity sector has outpaced the broader tech market by a meaningful margin. That is up until very recently. Cyber security remains the number one technology priority for the c-suite but as we’ve previously reported, the CISO’s budget has constraints; just like other technology investments. Recent trends show that economic headwinds have elongated sales cycles, pushed deals into future quarters and, just like other tech initiatives, are pacing cybersecurity investments and breaking them into smaller chunks. In this Breaking Analysis we explain how cybersecurity trends are reverting to the mean and tracking more closely with other technology investments. We’ll make a couple of valuation comparisons to show the magnitude of the challenge and which cyber firms are feeling the heat, and which aren’t as much. We’ll then show the latest survey data from ETR to quantify the contraction in spending momentum and close with a glimpse at the landscape of emerging cybersecurity companies that could be ripe for acquisition, consolidation or disruptive to the broader market. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 157 – re:Invent 2022 marks the next chapter in data & cloud – The ascendency of AWS under the leadership of Andy Jassy was marked by a tsunami of data and corresponding cloud services to leverage data. Those services mainly came in the form of primitives – i.e. basic building blocks that were used by developers to create more sophisticated capabilities. AWS in the 2020s, led by CEO Adam Selipsky, will be marked by four high level trends in our view: 1) A rush of data that will dwarf anything previously seen; 2) Doubling down on investments in the basic elements of cloud – compute, storage, database, security, etc; 3) Greater emphasis on end-to-end integration of AWS services to make data accessible to more professionals and further accelerate cloud adoption; and 4) Significantly deeper business integration of cloud, beyond IT, as an underlying element of organizational transformation. In this Breaking Analysis we extract and analyze nuggets from John Furrier’s annual sit down with the CEO of AWS. We’ll share data from ETR and other sources to set the context for the market and competition in cloud and we’ll give you our glimpse of what to expect at re:Invent 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 156 – Snowflake caught in the storm clouds – A better than expected earnings report in late August got people excited about Snowflake again but the negative sentiment in the market has weighed heavily on virtually all growth tech stocks. Snowflake is no exception. As we’ve stressed many times, the company’s management is on a long term mission to simplify the way organizations use data. Snowflake is tapping into a multi-hundred billion dollar total available market and continues to grow at a rapid pace. In our view the company is embarking on its third major wave of innovation, data apps, while its first and second waves are still bearing significant fruit. For short term traders focused on the next 90 or 180 days, that probably doesn’t matter much. But those taking a longer view are asking, should we still be optimistic about the future of this high flier or is it just another over-hyped tech play? In this Breaking Analysis we take a look at the most recent survey data from ETR to see what clues and nuggets we can extract to predict the near future and the long term outlook for Snowflake. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 155 – Cloudflare’s Supercloud…What Multi Cloud Could Have Been – Over the past decade, Cloudflare has built a global network that has the potential to become the fourth U.S.-based hyperscale-class cloud. In our view, the company is building a durable revenue model with hooks into many important markets. These include the more mature DDoS protection space, but also extend to growth sectors such as zero trust, a serverless platform for application development and an increasing number of services such as database and object storage. In essence, Cloudflare can be thought of as a giant, distributed supercomputer that can connect multiple clouds and act as a highly efficient scheduling engine– allocating and optimizing resources at scale. Its disruptive DNA is increasingly attracting novel startups and established global firms looking for a reliable, secure, high performance, low latency and more cost effective alternative to AWS and legacy infrastructure solutions. In this Breaking Analysis we initiate deeper coverage of Cloudflare. While the stock got hammered this past week on tepid guidance, we are optimistic about the company’s future. In this post, we’ll briefly explain our take on the company and its unique business model. We’ll then share some peer comparisons with both a financial snapshot and some fresh ETR survey data. Finally we’ll show some examples of how we think Cloudflare could be a disruptive force with a supercloud-like offering that, in many respects, is what multi-cloud should have been. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 154 – Even the Cloud Is Not Immune to the Seesaw Economy – Have you ever driven on the highway and traffic suddenly slows way down? And then after a little while it picks up again and you’re cruising along thinking…ok that was weird but it’s clear sailing now…only to find out in a bit that that traffic is building up again, forcing you to pump the brakes as the traffic patterns ebb and flow? Well welcome to the seesaw economy. The Fed induced fire that prompted a rally in tech is being purposely extinguished by that same Fed and virtually every sector of the tech industry is having to reset its expectations – including the cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review the implications of this week’s earnings announcements from the big 3 cloud players. The growth of AWS and Azure slowed while Google Cloud Platform’s growth accelerated. We’ll explain why GCP’s growth is still not fast enough. We’ll update you on our quarterly IaaS forecasts and share the latest cloud survey data from ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 153 – Survey Says! Takeaways from the latest CIO spending data – The overall technology spending outlook is deteriorating. And yet there are positive signs making things unpredictable. The negative sentiment is of course being driven by macroeconomic factors and earnings forecasts that have been coming down all year while interest rates keep rising. Making matters worse is many people think earnings estimates are still too high. It’s understandable why there’s so much uncertainty. Technology continues to boom. Digital transformations are happening in earnest. Leading companies have momentum and long cash runways. Moreover, the CEOs of these leading companies are still really optimistic. But strong guidance in an environment of uncertainty is risky and makes navigation more challenging. In this Breaking Analysis we try to put some guardrails on the market by sharing takeaways from from ETRs latest spending survey, which was released to their private clients on the 21st of October. Today we’re going to review the macro spending data, convey where CIOs think their cloud spend is headed, look at the actions organizations are taking to manage uncertainty and then review some of the technology companies that have the most positive and negative outlooks in the ETR data set. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 152 – CEO Nuggets from Microsoft Ignite & Google Cloud Next – This past week, we saw two of the “Big 3” cloud providers present an update of their respective cloud visions, business progress, announcements and innovations. The content at these events had many overlapping themes including modern cloud infrastructure at global scale, applying advanced machine intelligence, end-to-end data platforms, the future of work, automation and a taste of the metaverse/Web 3.0. And more. Despite the striking similarities, the differences between these two cloud platforms, and that of AWS, remain significant with Microsoft leveraging its massive application software footprint to dominate virtually all markets; AndGoogle doing everything in its power to keep up with the frenetic pace of today’s cloud innovation which was set into motion a decade and a half ago by AWS. In this Breaking Analysis, we unpack the immense amount of content presented by the CEOs of Microsoft and Google Cloud at Microsoft Ignite and Google Cloud Next. We’ll also quantify with ETR survey data, the relative position of these two cloud giants in four key sectors – Cloud IaaS, BI analytics, data platforms and collaboration software. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 151 – Analyst Take on Dell – Dave Vellante provides his take on the transformation of Dell to Dell EMC to Dell Technologies, the impact of the VMware spin out and what the future holds for this bellwether infrastructure player. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 150 – Latest CIO Survey Shows Steady Deceleration in IT Spend – Is the glass half full or half empty? Well, it depends on how you want to look at it. CIOs are tapping the brakes on spending that’s clear. The latest macro survey from ETR quantifies what we already know to be true, that IT spend is decelerating. CIOs and IT buyers forecast that their tech spend will grow by 5.5% this year, a meaningful deceleration from their year end 2021 expectations…but these levels are still well above historical norms – so while the feel good factor may be in some jeopardy, overall things are pretty good – at least for now. In this Breaking Analysis, we update you on the latest macro tech spending data from Enterprise Technology Research, including strategies organizations are employing to cut costs…and which project categories continue to see the most traction. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 149 – As the tech tide recedes, all sectors feel the pinch – Virtually all tech companies have expressed caution on their respective earnings calls. And why not… the macroeconomic environment is full of uncertainties and there’s no upside to providing aggressive guidance when sellers punish even the slightest miss. Moreover, the spending data confirms the market is softening across the board, so it’s becoming expected that CFOs will guide cautiously. But companies facing execution challenges can’t hide behind the macro. Which is why it’s important to understand which firms are best positioned to maintain momentum through the headwinds and come out the other side stronger. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll do three things: 1) Share a high-level view of the spending squeeze almost all sectors are experiencing; 2) Highlight some of those companies that continue to show notably strong momentum – and relative high spending velocity on their platforms – albeit less robust than last year; and 3) give you a peek at how one senior technology leader in the financial sector sees the competitive dynamic between AWS, Snowflake and Databricks. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 148 – UiPath is a Rocket Ship Resetting its Course – Like a marathon runner pumped up on adrenaline, UiPath sprinted to the lead in what is surely going to be a long journey toward enabling the modern automated enterprise. In doing so, the company has established itself as a leader in enterprise automation, while at the same time getting out over its skis on critical execution items and disappointing investors along the way. In our view, the company has plenty of upside potential but will have to slog through its current challenges including restructuring its go to market, prioritizing investments, balancing growth with profitability and dealing with a difficult macro environment. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Forward5, UiPath’s customer conference, we once again dig into RPA and automation leader UiPath, to share our most current data and view of the company’s prospects, its performance relative to the competition and market overall. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 147 – How CrowdStrike Plans to Become a Generational Platform – In just over ten years, CrowdStrike has become a leading independent security firm. It has more than $2B in annual recurring revenue, nearly 60% ARR growth, a roughly $40B market capitalization, very high retention and a path to $5B in revenue by mid-decade. The company has joined Palo Alto Networks as a gold standard pure play cyber firm. It has achieved this lofty status with an architecture that enables it to go beyond point product. Combine this with outstanding go to market, solid financial execution, some sharp acquisitions and an ever-increasing total available market and you have the formula for a great company. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Fal.Con, CrowdStrike’s user conference, we take a deeper look into the company, its performance, its platform and customer survey data from our partner ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 146 – We Have the Data…What Private Tech Companies Don’t Tell you About Their Business – The negative sentiment in tech stocks, caused by rising interest rates, less attractive discounted cash flow models and more tepid forward guidance, is easily measured by public market valuations. And while there’s lots of talk about the impact on private companies, their cash runways and 409A valuations, measuring the performance of non-public companies isn’t as easy. IPOs have dried up and public statements by private companies accentuate the good and hide the bad. Real data, unless you’re an insider, is hard to find. In this Breaking Analysis we unlock some of the secrets that non-public, emerging tech companies may or may not be sharing. We do this by introducing you to a capability from ETR that we’ve not previously exposed in Breaking Analysis. It’s called the ETR Emerging Technology Survey and is packed with sentiment and performance data based on surveys of more than 1,000 CIOs & IT buyers covering more than 400 private companies. The survey will highlight metrics on the evaluation, adoption and churn rates for private companies and the mindshare they’re able to capture. We’ve invited back our colleague Erik Bradley of ETR to help explain the survey and the data we’re going to cover in this post. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 145 – VMware Explore 2022 will mark the start of a Supercloud journey – While the precise direction of VMware’s future is unknown, given the planned Broadcom acquisition, one thing is clear; the subject of what Hock E. Tan plans will not be the main focus of the agenda at the upcoming VMware Explore event next week in San Francisco. We believe that despite any uncertainty, VMware will lay out for its customers what it sees as its future. And that future is multi-cloud or cross cloud services; what we would call supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis we drill into the latest ETR survey data on VMware. We’ll share with you the next iteration of the supercloud definition based on feedback from dozens of contributors. And we’ll give you our take on what to expect at VMware Explore next week. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 144 – What Black Hat ’22 tells us about securing the Supercloud – Black Hat 2022 was held in Las Vegas last week, at the same time as theCUBE’s supercloud event. Unlike AWS re:Inforce, where words are carefully chosen to put a positive spin on security, Black Hat exposes all the warts of cybersecurity and openly discusses its hard truths. It’s a conference attended by technical experts who proudly share some of the vulnerabilities they’ve discovered and of course by numerous vendors marketing their products and services. In this Breaking Analysis we summarize what we learned from discussions with several people who attended Black Hat and our analysis from reviewing dozens of keynotes, articles, videos, session talks, Dark Reading interviews and data from a recent Black Hat attendees survey conducted by Black Hat and Informa. We’ll also share data from ETR in a recent post discussing how Zscaler became the last line of defense for a manufacturing firm. We’ll end with a discussion of what it all means for the challenges around securing the supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 143 – Further defining Supercloud With tech leaders VMware, Snowflake, Databricks & others – At our inaugural Supercloud22 event we sought community input to evolve the concept of a supercloud by iterating on the definition, the salient attributes and examples of what is and is not a supercloud. We asked several technologists including experts from VMware, Snowflake, Databricks, HashiCorp, Confluent, Intuit, Cohesity and others to help test the supercloud definition, operational models, service models and principles. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack our discussions with these technology leaders and apply their input to iterate the definition of supercloud. We then go in-depth to examine Snowflake’s Data Cloud architecture as a leading example of supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 142 – What we hope to learn at Supercloud22 – The term supercloud is relatively new, but the concepts behind it have been bubbling for years. Early last decade when NIST put forth its original definition of cloud computing, it said services had to be accessible over a public network…essentially cutting the on-prem crowd out of the conversation. A guy named Chuck Hollis, a CTO at EMC and prolific blogger objected to that criterion and laid out his vision for what he termed a private cloud. In that post he showed a workload running both on premises and in a public cloud, sharing the underlying resources in an automated and seamless manner – what later became more broadly known as hybrid cloud. That vision, as we now know, really never materialized and we were left with multi-cloud…sets of largely incompatible and disconnected cloud services running in separate silos. The point is, what Hollis put forth – i.e. the ability to abstract underlying infrastructure complexity and run workloads across multiple heterogeneous estates with an identical experience – is what supercloud is all about. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 141 – How the cloud is changing security defenses in the 2020s – AThe rapid pace of cloud adoption has changed the way organizations approach cybersecurity. Specifically, the cloud is increasingly becoming the first line of cyber defense. As such, along with communicating to the board and creating a security-aware culture, the CISO must ensure that the shared responsibility model is being applied properly. The DevSecOps team has emerged as the critical link between strategy and execution, while audit becomes the “free safety” in the equation – i.e. the last line of defense. In this Breaking Analysis we share our puts and takes from AWS re:Inforce with an update on the latest hyperscale IaaS market shares; and insights from ETR survey data. We’ll also dig deeper into some technical aspects of AWS Nitro, a system we believe is one of AWS’ secret weapons, with a focus on confidential computing and what it means for the future of systems architecture. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 140 – AWS re:Inforce marks a summer checkpoint on cybersecurity – After a two year hiatus, AWS re:Inforce is back on as an in-person event in Boston next week. Like the all-star break in baseball, re:Inforce gives us an opportunity to evaluate the cybersecurity market overall, the state of cloud security and what AWS is up to in the sector. In this Breaking Analysis, we’ll share our view of what’s changed since our last cyber update in May, we’ll look at the macro environment, how it’s impacting cybersecurity plays in the market, what the ETR data tells us and what to expect at next week’s AWS re:Inforce. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 139 – Amping it up with Frank Slootman – Organizations have considerable room to improve their performance without making expensive changes to their talent, structure or fundamental business model. You don’t need a slew of consultants to tell you what to do. You already know. What you need is to immediately ratchet up expectations, energy, urgency and intensity. Fight mediocrity every step of the way. Amp it up and the results will follow. This is the fundamental premise of a hard hitting new book written by Frank Slootman, CEO of Snowflake, and published earlier this year. It’s called, Amp it Up, Leading for Hypergrowth by Raising Expectations, Increasing Urgency and Elevating Intensity. At Snowflake Summit last month, I was invited to interview Frank on stage about his book. I’ve read it several times and if you haven’t picked it up, you should. Even if you have read it, in this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig deeper into the book and share some clarifying insights and unpublished nuances of Frank’s philosophy. You’ll hear directly from Slootman himself with excerpts from my one on one conversation with him. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 138 – Answering the top 10 questions about SuperCloud – As we exited the isolation economy last year, supercloud is a term we introduced to describe something new that was happening in the world of cloud. In this Breaking Analysis we address the ten most frequently asked questions we get on supercloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 137 – H1 of ‘22 was ugly…H2 could be worse…Here’s why we’re still optimistic – After a two year epic run in tech, 2022 has been an epically bad year in the market. Through yesterday, the Nasdaq composite is down 30%, the S&P 500 is off 21%, the DJIA down 16% and the poor HODLers of BTC have had to endure a nearly 60% decline year to date. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 136 – Tech Spending Intentions are Holding Despite Macro Concerns – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 135 – Snowflake Summit 2022…All About Apps & Monetization – Much of the energy around data innovation that dispersed with the decline of Hadoop’s relevance is coalescing in a new ecosystem spawned by the ascendency of Snowflake’s Data Cloud. What was once seen as a simpler cloud data warehouse and good marketing with Data Cloud, is evolving rapidly with new workloads, a vertical industry focus, data applications, monetization and more. The question is will the promises of data be fulfilled this time around or is it same wine, new bottle? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 134 – How Snowflake Plans to Make Data Cloud a De Facto Standard – When Frank Slootman took ServiceNow public, many people undervalued the company, positioning it as just a better help desk tool. It turns out the firm actually had a massive TAM expansion opportunity in ITSM, HR, logistics, security, marketing and customer service management. NOW’s stock price followed the stellar execution under Slootman and CFO Mike Scarpelli’s leadership. When they took the reins at Snowflake, expectations were already set that they’d repeat the feat but this time, if anything, the company was overvalued out of the gate. It can be argued that most people didn’t really understand the market opportunity any better this time around. Other than that it was a bet on Slootman’s track record of execution…and data. Good bets; but folks really didn’t appreciate that Snowflake wasn’t just a better data warehouse. That it was building what the company calls a data cloud…and we’ve termed a data supercloud. In this Breaking Analysis and ahead of Snowflake Summit, we’ll do four things: 1) Review the recent narrative and concerns about Snowflake and its value; 2) Share survey data from ETR that will confirm almost precisely what the company’s CFO has been telling anyone who will listen; 3) Share our view of what Snowflake is building – i.e. trying to become the de facto standard data platform; and 4) Convey our expectations for the upcoming Snowflake Summit next week at Caesar’s Palace in Las Vegas. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 133 – MongoDB Sends Strong Signals Despite Cautious Macro Tones – Earnings season has shown a conflicting mix of signals for software companies. Most firms are expressing caution over macro headwinds citing a combination of Ukraine, inflation, interest rates, EMEA softness, currency, supply chain and general demand for technology. But MongoDB, along with a few other names appeared more sanguine, thanks to a beat in the recent quarter and a cautious but upbeat outlook for the near term. In this Breaking Analysis, ahead of MongoDB World 2022, we drill into the company’s business and what ETR survey data tells us in the context of overall demand and the patterns from other software companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 132 – Broadcom, Taming the VMware Beast – In the words of CUBE analyst and former CTO David Nicholson, Broadcom buys old cars. Not to restore them to their original beauty…nope…they buy classic cars to extract the platinum that’s inside the catalytic converter. Broadcom’s planned $61B acquisition of VMware will mark yet another new era for the virtualization leader, a mere seven months after finally getting spun out as a fully independent company by Dell. For VMware this means a dramatically different operating model, with financial performance and shareholder value creation as the dominant and perhaps sole agenda. For customers it will mean a more focused portfolio, less aspirational vision pitches and most certainly higher prices. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll share data, opinions and customer insights about this blockbuster deal and forecast the future of VMware, Broadcom and the broader ecosystem. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 131 – Supercloud is becoming a thing – Last year we noted in a Breaking Analysis that the cloud ecosystem is innovating beyond the notion of multicloud. We’ve said for years that multicloud is really not a strategy but rather a symptom of multivendor. We used the term supercloud to describe an abstraction layer that resides above and across hyperscale infrastructure, connects on premises workloads and eventually stretches to the edge. Our premise is that supercloud goes beyond running services in native mode on each individual cloud. Rather supercloud hides the underlying primitives and APIs of the respective cloud vendors and creates a new connection layer across locations. Since our initial post, we’ve found many examples within the ecosystem of technology companies working on so-called supercloud in various forms. Including some examples that actually do not try to hide cloud primitives but rather are focused on creating a consistent experience for developers across the devsecops tool chain, while preserving access to low level cloud services. In this Breaking Analysis we share some recent examples of supercloud that we’ve uncovered. We also tap theCUBE network to access direct quotes about supercloud from the many CUBE guests we’ve recently had on the program. Here we test the concept’s technical and business feasibility. We’ll also post some recent ETR data to put into context some of the players we think are going after this opportunity and where they’re at in their supercloud buildout. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 130 – Are Cyber Stocks Oversold or Still too Pricey? – Cybersecurity stocks have been sending mixed signals as of late…Mostly negative like much of tech. But some, such as Palo Alto Networks, despite a tough go of it recently, have held up better than most tech names. Others like CrowdStrike had been outperforming broader tech in March but then flipped in May. Okta’s performance was somewhat tracking along with CrowdStrike for most of the past several months but then the Okta hack changed the trajectory of that name. Zscaler has crossed the critical $1B ARR revenue milestone and sees a path to $5B, but the company’s stock fell sharply after its last earnings report and has been on a downtrend since last November…Meanwhile CyberArk’s recent beat and raise was encouraging and the stock acted well after its last report. Security remains the #1 initiative priority amongst IT organizations and the spending momentum for many high flying cyber names remains strong. So what gives in cybersecurity? In this Breaking Analysis we focus on security and will update you on the latest data from ETR to try and make sense out of the market and read into what this all means in both the near and long term for some of our favorite names in the sector. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 129- What you May not Know About the Dell Snowflake Deal – In the pre-cloud era, hardware companies would run benchmarks showing how database and application performance ran best on their systems relative to competitors and previous generation boxes. They would make a big deal out of it and the independent software vendors would do a “golf clap” in the form of a joint press release. It was a game of leapfrog amongst hardware competitors that became pretty commonplace over the years. The Dell-Snowflake deal underscores that the value prop between hardware companies and ISVs is changing and has much more to do with distribution channels and the amount of data that lives on-prem in various storage platforms. For cloud-native ISVs like Snowflake, they are realizing that despite their cloud-only dogma, they have to grit their teeth and deal with on-premises data or risk getting shut out of evolving data architectures. In this Breaking Analysis we unpack what little is known about the Snowflake announcement from Dell Technologies World… and discuss the implications of a changing cloud ecosystem landscape. We’ll also share some new ETR data for cloud and database platforms that shows Snowflake has actually entered the earth’s orbit when it comes to spending momentum on its platform. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 128- The Ever expanding Cloud Continues to Storm the IT Universe – Despite a mixed bag of earnings reports from tech companies, negative GDP growth this past quarter and rising inflation…the cloud continues its relentless expansion on the IT landscape. AWS, Microsoft and Alphabet have all reported earnings and, when you include Alibaba’s cloud in the mix, the big 4 hyperscalers are on track to generate $167B in revenue this year based on our projections. But as we’ve said many times the definition of cloud is expanding. And hybrid environments are becoming the norm at major organizations. We’re seeing the largest enterprise tech companies focus on solving for hybrid and every public cloud company now has a strategy to bring their environments closer to where customers’ workloads live – in data centers and the edge. Hello and welcome to this week’s Wikibon CUBE Insights, Powered by ETR. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest cloud projections and outlook. We’ll share the latest ETR data and some commentary on what’s happening in the “hybrid zone” of cloud. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 127- Does Hardware Still Matter – The ascendancy of cloud and SaaS has shone new light on how organizations think about, pay for, and value hardware. Once-sought-after skills for practitioners with expertise in hardware troubleshooting, configuring ports, tuning storage arrays and maximizing server utilization have been superseded by demand for cloud architects, DevOps pros and developers with expertise in microservices, container app development and similar skills. Even a company like Dell, the largest hardware company in enterprise tech, touts that it has more software engineers than those working in hardware. It begs the question: Is hardware going the way of COBOL? Well, not likely — software has to run on something. But the labor and skills needed to deploy, troubleshoot and manage hardware infrastructure is shifting quite dramatically. At the same time we’ve seen the value flow also changing in hardware. Once a world dominated by x86 processors, value is flowing to alternatives like Nvidia and Arm-based designs. Moreover, other components like NICs, accelerators and storage controllers are becoming more advanced, integrated and increasingly important. The question is: Does it matter? If so, why does it matter and to whom? What does it mean to customers, workloads, OEMs and the broader society? In this Breaking Analysis we try to answer these questions and to do so we’ve organized a special CUBE Power Panel of industry analysts and experts to address the question: Does Hardware (Still) Matter? Watch the full video analysis. Episode 126 – Technology & Architectural Considerations for Data Mesh – The introduction and socialization of data mesh has caused practitioners, business technology executives and technologists to pause and ask some probing questions about the organization of their data teams, their data strategies, future investments and their current architectural approaches. Some in the technology community have embraced the concept, others have twisted the definition while still others remain oblivious to the momentum building around data mesh. We are in the early days of data mesh adoption. Organizations that have taken the plunge will tell you aligning stakeholders is a non-trivial effort. But one that is necessary to break through the limitations that monolithic data architectures and highly specialized teams have imposed over frustrated business and domain leaders. However, practical data mesh examples often lie in the eyes of the implementer and may not strictly adhere to the principles of data mesh. Part of the problem is the lack of open technologies and standards that can accelerate adoption and reduce friction. This is the topic of today’s Breaking Analysis where we investigate some of the key technology and architectural questions around data mesh. To do so, we welcome back the founder of data mesh and Director of Emerging Technologies at ThoughtWorks, Zhamak Dehghani. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 125 – Customer ripple effects from the Okta breach are worse than you think – The recent security breach of an Okta third party supplier has been widely reported. The criticisms of Okta’s response have been harsh and the impact on Okta’s value has been obvious. Investors shaved about $6B off the company’s market cap during the week the hack was made public. We believe Okta’s claim that the customer technical impact was “near zero,” may be semantically correct. However, based on customer data, we feel Okta has a blind spot. There are customer ripple effects that require clear action, which are missed in Okta’s public statements. Okta’s product portfolio remains solid. It is a clear leader in the identity space. But in our view, one part of the long journey back to credibility requires Okta to fully understand and recognize the true scope of this breach on its customers. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome our ETR colleague Erik Bradley to share new data from the community. In addition, we’ll analyze some of the statements made by Okta CEO Todd McKinnon in an interview with Emily Chang on Bloomberg to see how they align with what customers tell us.

Episode 124 – New Data Signals C Suite Taps the Brakes on Tech Spending – Fresh survey data from ETR shows a clear deceleration in spending and a more cautious posture from technology buyers. Just this week we saw sell side downgrades in hardware companies like Dell and HP; and revised guidance from high flier UiPath, citing exposure to Russia, Europe and certain sales execution challenges. But these headlines we think are a canary in the coal mine pointing to broader tech spending softness. According to ETR analysis and channel checks in theCUBE community, the real story is these issues are not isolated. Rather we’re seeing signs of caution from buyers across the board in enterprise tech. In this Breaking Analysis we are the bearers of bad news, relatively speaking. We’ll share a first look at new data that suggest a tightening in tech spending, calling for 6% growth this year, which is below our January prediction of 8% for 2022. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 123 – Governments Should Heed the History of Tech Antitrust Policy – There are very few political issues that get bipartisan support these days, never mind consensus spanning geopolitical boundaries. But whether we’re talking across the aisle or over the pond, there seems to be common agreement that the power of big tech firms should be regulated. However the government’s track record when it comes to antitrust aimed at tech is mixed, at best. History shows that market forces, rather than public policy, have been much more effective at curbing monopoly power in the technology industry. Moreover, the standard for antitrust action has always been demonstrating consumer harm. Many of today’s policy makers are challenging that notion and using market dominance and the potential for consumer harm as the new benchmark for intervention. In this week’s Breaking Analysis we welcome in frequent CUBE contributor David Moschella, author and senior fellow at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. We explore several issues including the efficacy of governments’ antitrust actions against big tech, what types of remedies have been and can be most effective and a first pass assessment of the new rules EU regulators just agreed to try and rein in big tech companies. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 122 – Snowflake’s Wild Ride – Snowflake…they love the stock at 400 and hate it at 165. That’s the nature of the business isn’t it? Especially in this crazy cycle over the last two years of lockdowns, free money, exploding demand and now rising inflation and rates. But with the Fed providing some clarity on its actions, the time has come to really look at the fundamentals of companies and there’s no tech company more fun to analyze than Snowflake. In this breaking analysis we take look at the action of Snowflake’s stock since its IPO, why it’s behaved the way it has, how some sharp traders are looking at the stock and most importantly, what customer demand looks like. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 121 – Pat Gelsinger has the Vision Intel Just Needs Time, Cash & a Miracle – Intel’s future would be a disaster without Pat Gelsinger. Even with his clear vision, fantastic leadership, deep technical and business acumen and amazing positivity, the company’s future is in serious jeopardy. It’s the same story we’ve been telling for years. Volume is king in the semiconductor industry and Intel no longer is the volume leader. Despite Intel’s efforts to change that dynamic with several recent moves, including making another go at its foundry business, the company is years away from reversing its lagging position relative to today’s leading foundries and design shops. Intel’s best chance to survive as a leader in our view will come from a combination of a massive market, continued supply constraints, government money and luck – perhaps in the form of a deal with Apple in the mid- to long term. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest assessment of Intel’s competitive position and unpack nuggets from the company’s February investor conference. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 120 – RPA has Become a Transformation Catalyst, Here’s What’s New – In its early days, robotic process automation emerged from rudimentary screen scraping, macros and workflow automation software. Once a script-heavy and limited tool that was almost exclusively used to perform mundane tasks for individual users, RPA has evolved into an enterprise-wide megatrend that puts automation at the center of digital business initiatives. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly update of the trends in RPA and share the latest survey data from Enterprise Technology Research. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 119 – Cyber Stocks Caught in the Storm While Private Firms Keep Rising – The pandemic precipitated what is shaping up to be a permanent shift in cyber security spending patterns. As a direct result of hybrid work, CISOs have invested heavily in endpoint security, identity access management, cloud security and further hardening the network beyond the HQ. Moreover, the need to build security into applications from the start, rather than bolting protection on as an afterthought, has led to vastly heightened awareness around DevSecOps. Finally, attacking security as a data problem with automation and AI is fueling new innovations in cyber products and services; and is spawning well-funded, disruptive startups. In this Breaking Analysis we present our quarterly findings on the security sector. We’ll share the latest ETR survey data, identify the companies with customer spending momentum and share some of the market movers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 118 – The Improbable Rise of Kubernetes – The rise of Kubernetes came about through a combination of forces that were in hindsight, quite a long shot. AWS’ dominance created momentum for cloud native application development and the need for simpler experiences beyond easily spinning up compute as a service. This wave crashed into innovations from a startup named Docker and a reluctant open source benefactor in Google that needed a way to change the game on Amazon in the cloud. Factor in Red Hat, which needed a path beyond Linux and was just about to opt for an alternative to Kubernetes to power OpenShift. Finally, figure out a governance structure to herd all the cats in the ecosystem so you can win out over other competition and create a de facto standard. Make all that happen and you get the remarkable ascendancy of Kubernetes. Such was the story unveiled recently in a new two-part documentary series from Honeypot simply titled “Kubernetes.” In this Breaking Analysis we tap the back stories of this documentary, which explains the improbable events leading to the creation of Kubernetes. We’ll share commentary from early Kubernetes committers and key players who came on theCUBE to piece together how it all happened. Finally, we’ll present new survey data from ETR on containers. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 117 – What to Expect in Cloud 2022 & Beyond – We’ve often said that the next ten years in cloud computing won’t be like the last ten. Cloud has firmly planted its footprint on the other side of the chasm with the momentum of the entire multi-trillion dollar technology business behind it. Both sellers and buyers are leaning in by adopting cloud technologies and many are building their own value layers on top of cloud. In the coming years we expect innovation will continue to coalesce around the big 3 U.S. clouds, plus Alibaba in APAC, with the ecosystem building value on top of the hardware, software and tools provided by the hyperscalers. Importantly, we don’t see this as a race to the bottom. Rather our expectation is that the large public cloud players will continue to take cost out of their platforms through innovation, automation and integration. Other cloud providers and the ecosystem, including traditional IT buyers, will leverage hyperscale clouds and mine opportunities in their respective markets. This is not a zero sum game. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll update you on our latest projections in the cloud market, share some new ETR survey data with some surprising nuggets; and drill into the important cloud database landscape. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 116 – Securing Snowflake – The amount of data ingested into a data warehouse overwhelmed the system. Every time Intel came out with a new microprocessor, practitioners would “chase the chips” in an effort to try and compress the overly restrictive elapsed time to insights. This cycle repeated itself for decades. Cloud data warehouses generally and Snowflake specifically changed all this. Not only were resources virtually infinite, but the ability to separate compute from storage permanently altered the cost, performance, scale and value equation. But as data makes its way into the cloud and is increasingly democratized as a shared resource across clouds – and at the edge – practitioners must bring a SecDevOps mindset to securing their cloud data warehouses. This Breaking Analysis takes a closer look at the fundamentals of securing Snowflake. An important topic as data becomes more accessible and available to a growing ecosystem of users, customers and partners. To do so we welcome two guests to this episode. Ben Herzberg is an experienced hacker, developer and an expert in several aspects of data security. Yoav Cohen is a technology visionary and currently serving as CTO at Satori Cyber. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 115 – Enterprise Technology Predictions 2022 – The pandemic has changed the way we think about, and predict the future. As we enter the third year of COVID, we see the significant impact it’s had on technology strategies, spending patterns and company fortunes. Much has changed and while many of these changes were forced reactions to a new abnormal, the trends we’ve seen over the past twenty-four months have become more entrenched and point the way to what’s ahead in the technology business. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome our data partner and colleague Erik Porter Bradley from ETR and we put forth our annual predictions for enterprise technology in 2022 and beyond. We’ll do our best to backup our predictions specific supporting data and more granular detail that can be measured as accurate or not. Please refer to the grading of our 2021 predictions to judge for yourself how we did last year. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 114 – Cyber, Blockchain & NFTs Meet the Metaverse – When Facebook changed its name to Meta last fall it catalyzed a chain reaction throughout the tech industry. Software firms, gaming companies, chip makers, device manufacturers and others have joined in the hype machine. It’s easy to dismiss the metaverse as futuristic hyperbole, but do we really believe that tapping on a smartphone, staring at a screen or two dimensional Zoom meetings are the future of how we work, play and communicate? As the Internet itself proved to be larger than we ever imagined, it’s very possible that the combination of massive processing power, cheap storage, AI, blockchains, crypto, sensors, AR/VR, brain interfaces and other emerging technologies will combine to create new and unimaginable consumer experiences; and massive wealth for creators of the metaverse. In this Breaking Analysis we explore the intersection of cybersecurity, blockchain, crypto currency, NFTs and the emerging metaverse. To do so we welcome in cyber expert, hacker, gamer, NFT expert and founder of Ore System, Nick Donarski. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 113 – Analyst Predictions 2022: The Future of Data Management – In the 2010’s, organizations became keenly aware that data would become the critical ingredient in driving competitive advantage, differentiation and growth. But to this day, putting data to work remains a difficult challenge for many if not most organizations. As the cloud matures it has become a game changer for data practitioners by making cheap storage and massive processing power readily accessible. We’ve also seen better tooling in the form of data workflows, streaming, machine intelligence/AI, developer tools, security, observability, automation, new databases and the like. These innovations accelerate data proficiency but at the same time add complexity for practitioners. Data lakes, data hubs, data warehouses, data marts, data fabrics, data meshes, data catalogs and data oceans are forming, evolving and exploding onto the scene. In an effort to bring perspective to this sea of optionality, we’ve brought together some of the brightest minds in the data analyst community to discuss how data management is morphing and what practitioners should expect in 2022 and beyond. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 112 – Grading our 2021 Predictions – Predictions are all the rage this time of year. On December 29th, 2020, in collaboration with Erik Porter Bradley of Enterprise Technology Research, we put forth our predictions for 2021. The focus of our prognostications included tech spending, remote work, productivity apps, cyber, IPOs, SPACs, M&A, data architecture, cloud, hybrid cloud, multi-cloud, AI, containers, automation and semiconductors. We covered a lot of ground! In this Breaking Analysis, as a warmup for our 2022 predictions post, we’ll review each of our predictions for this past year and grade the accuracy of our forecasts Watch the full video analysis. Episode 111 – Why Oracle’s Stock is Surging to an All time High – On Friday, Oracle announced a meaningful earnings beat and strong forward guidance on the strength of its license business; and slightly better than expected cloud performance. The stock rose sharply on the day and closed up nearly 16% surpassing $280B in market value. Oracle’s success is due largely to its execution of a highly differentiated strategy that has evolved over the past decade or more; deeply integrating its hardware and software, heavily investing in next generation cloud, creating a homogenous experience across its application portfolio and becoming the number one platform for the world’s most mission critical applications. While investors piled into the stock, skeptics will point to the beat being tilted toward license revenue and investors will likely keep one finger on the sell button until they’re convinced Oracle’s cloud momentum is more consistent and predictable. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review Oracle’s most recent quarter and pull in some ETR survey data to frame the company’s cloud business, the momentum of Fusion ERP, where the company is winning and some gaps/opportunities we see that can be addressed in the coming quarters. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 110 – Rise of the Supercloud – Last week’s AWS re:Invent underscored the degree to which cloud computing generally and AWS specifically have impacted the technology landscape. From making infrastructure deployment simpler, to accelerating the pace of innovation, to the formation of the world’s most active and vibrant technology ecosystem; it’s clear that AWS has been the number one force for industry change in the last decade. Going forward we see three high level contributors from AWS that will drive the next 10 years of innovation, including: 1) the degree to which data will play a defining role in determining winners and losers; 2) the knowledge assimilation effect of AWS’ cultural processes such as two pizza teams, customer obsession and working backwards; and 3) the rise of superclouds– that is clouds built on top of hyperscale infrastructure that focus not only on IT transformation, but deeper business integration and digital transformation of entire industries. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll review some of the takeaways from the 10th annual AWS re:Invent conference and focus on how we see the rise of superclouds impacting the future of virtually all industries. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 109 – Break up Amazon? Survey Suggests it May Not be Necessary – Despite the posture that big tech generally and Amazo.com Inc.specifically should be regulated and/or broken apart, recent survey research suggests that Amazon faces many disruption challenges, independent of any government intervention. Specifically, respondents to our survey believe that history will repeat itself in that there’s a 60% probability that Amazon will be disrupted by market forces, including self-inflicted wounds. Amazon faces at least seven significant disruption scenarios of varying likelihood and impact, perhaps leading to the conclusion that the government should let the market adjudicate Amazon’s ultimate destiny. In this Breaking Analysis, and ahead of AWS re:Invent, we share the results of our survey designed to asses what, if anything, could disrupt Amazon. We’ll also show you some data from ETR that indicates the strong momentum of AWS is likely to continue, which could be a factor in any government intervention. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 108 – AWS & Azure Accelerate Cloud Momentum – Despite all the talk about repatriation, hybrid and multi-cloud opportunities and cloud as an increasingly expensive option for customers…the data continues to show the importance of public cloud to the digital economy. Moreover, the two leaders, AWS and Azure are showing signs of accelerated momentum that point to those two giants pulling away from the pack in the years ahead. Each of these companies is demonstrating broad-based momentum across their respective product lines. It’s unclear if anything other than government intervention or self-inflicted wounds will slow these two companies down this decade. Despite the commanding lead of the two leaders, a winning strategy for companies that don’t run their own cloud continues to be innovating on top of their massive CAPEX investments. The most notable example of this approach in our view continues to be Snowflake. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will provide our quarterly market share update of the big four hyperscale cloud providers. We’ll share some new data from ETR based on the most recent survey, drill into some of the reasons for the momentum of AWS and Azure; and drill further into the database and data warehouse sector to see what if anything has changed in that space. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 107 – Cutting Through the Noise of Full Stack Observability – Full stack observability is the new buzz phrase. As businesses go digital, customer experience becomes ever more important. Why? Because fickle consumers can switch brands in the blink of an eye – or the click of a mouse. Every vendor wants a piece of the action in this market including companies that have provided traditional monitoring, log analytics, application performance management, and related services. These companies are joined by a slew of new entrants claiming end-to-end visibility across the so-called “modern tech stack.” Recent survey research however confirms our thesis that no one company has it all. New entrants have a vision and are not encumbered by legacy technical debt. However their offerings are immature. Established players with deep feature sets in one segment are pivoting through M&A and organic development to fill gaps. Meanwhile, cloud players are gaining traction and participating through a combination of native tooling combined with strong ecosystems to address this opportunity. In this Breaking Analysis we dive into a recent ETR drill down study on full stack observability. And to do so we once again welcome in our colleague Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at ETR. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 106 – What Could Disrupt Amazon? – Five publicly traded, US-based companies have market valuations over or just near one trillion dollars. As of Oct. 29th, Apple and Microsoft top the list, each at $2.5T, followed by Alphabet at $2T, Amazon at $1.7T and Facebook (now Meta) at just under $1T – off from its high of $1.1T prior to its recent troubles. These companies have reached extraordinary levels of success and power. What, if anything could disrupt their market dominance? In his book Seeing Digital, Author David Moschella made three key points that are relevant: In the technology industry, disruptions are the norm – The waves of mainframes, Minis, PCs, Mobile and the Internet all saw new companies emerge and power structures that dwarfed previous eras of innovation. Is that dynamic changing? Every industry has a disruption scenario. Silicon Valley – broadly defined to include Seattle, or at least Amazon – has a dual disruption agenda. The first being horizontally targeting the technology industry and the second as digital disruptors in virtually any industry. How relevant is that to the future power structure of the technology business? In this Breaking Analysis we welcome in author, speaker, researcher, thought leader and senior fellow at ITIF, David Moschella to assess what could possibly disrupt today’s trillionaire companies. And we’ll start with Amazon. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 105 – Data Mesh…A New Paradigm for Data Management – Data mesh is a new way of thinking about how to use data to create organizational value. Leading edge practitioners are beginning to implement data mesh in earnest. Importantly, data mesh is not a single tool or a rigid reference architecture. Rather it’s an architectural and organizational model that is designed to address the shortcomings of decades of data challenges and failures. As importantly, it’s a new way to think about how to leverage and share data at scale across an organization and ecosystems. Data mesh in our view will become the defining paradigm for the next generation of data excellence. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome the founder and creator of data mesh, author, thought leader, technologist Zhamak Dehghani, who will help us better understand some of core principles of data mesh and the future of decentralized data management. With practical advice for data pros who want to create the next generation of data-driven organizations. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 104 – The Hybrid Cloud Tug of War Gets Real – It looks like Hybrid cloud is finally here. We’ve seen a decade of posturing, marketecture, slideware and narrow examples but there’s little question that the definition of cloud is expanding to include on-premises workloads in hybrid models. Depending on which numbers you choose to represent IT spending, public cloud accounts for less than 5% of the total pie. As such there’s a huge opportunity in hybrid, outside of the pure public cloud; and everyone wants a piece of the action. The big question is how will this now evolve? Customers want control, governance, security, flexibility and a feature-rich set of services to build their digital businesses. It’s unlikely they can buy all that – so they’re going to have to build it with partners. Specifically vendors, SIs, consultancies, and their own developers. The tug-of-war to win the new cloud day has finally started in earnest – between the hyperscalers and the largest enterprise tech companies in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 103 – The Future of the Semiconductor Industry – Semiconductors are at the heart of technology innovation. For decades, technology improvements have marched to the cadence of silicon advancements in performance, cost, power and packaging. In the past ten years, the dynamics of the semiconductor industry have changed dramatically. Soaring factory costs, device volume explosions, fabless chip companies, greater programmability, compressed time to tape out, more software content, the looming Chinese presence…these and other factors have permanently changed the power structure of the semiconductor business. We rely on chips for every aspect of our lives, which has led to a global semiconductor shortage that has impacted more industries than we’ve ever seen. Our premise is that silicon success in the next twenty years will be determined by volume manufacturing expertise, design innovation, public policy, geopolitical dynamics, visionary leadership and innovative business models that can survive the intense competition in one of the most challenging businesses in the world. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 102 – UiPath Fast Forward to Enterprise Automation | UiPath FORWARD IV – UiPath has always been an unconventional company. It started with humble beginnings as essentially a software development shop. It then caught lightning in a bottle with its computer vision technology and simplification mantra…creating easy to deploy software robots for bespoke departments to automate mundane tasks. The story is well known…the company grew rapidly and was able to go public earlier this year. Consistent with its out of the ordinary approach, while other firms are shutting down travel and physical events, UiPath is moving ahead with Forward IV, its annual user conference next week…with a live audience at the Bellagio in Las Vegas. It’s also “Fast Forwarding” as a company, determined to lead the charge beyond RPA point tools and execute on a more all-encompassing enterprise automation agenda. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 101 – CIOs Signal Hybrid Work Will Power Spending Through 2022 – Throughout the pre-vaccine COVID era, IT buyers indicated budget constraints would squeeze 2020 spending by roughly 5% relative to 2019 levels. But the forced March to digital combined with increased cyber threats for remote workers, created a modernization mandate that powered Q4 spending last year. This momentum has carried through to 2021. While COVID variants have delayed return to work and business travel plans, our current forecast for global IT spending remains strong at 6-7%, slightly down from previous estimates. But the real story is CIOs and IT buyers expect a 7-8% increase in 2022 spending, reflecting investments in hybrid work strategies and a continued belief that technology remains the underpinning of competitive advantage in the coming decade. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will share the latest results of ETR’s macro spending survey and update you on industry and sector investment patterns. Watch the full video analysis. Following is the complete collection to date, crystallizing the key topics of the past year or so. We hope you enjoy these episodes and, as always, welcome your feedback. Episode 100 – How Cisco can win cloud’s ‘Game of Thrones’ – Cisco is a company at the crossroads. It is transitioning from a high margin hardware business to a software subscription-based model through both organic moves and targeted acquisitions. It’s doing so in the context of massive macro shifts to digital and the cloud. We believe Cisco’s dominant position in networking, combined with a large market opportunity and a strong track record of earning customer trust, put the company in a good position to capitalize on cloud momentum. But there are clear challenges ahead, not the least of which is the growing complexity of Cisco’s portfolio, transitioning a large legacy business and the mandate to maintain its higher profitability profile as it moves to a new business model. In this Breaking Analysis, we welcome in Zeus Kerravala, Founder and Principal Analyst at ZK Research and long time Cisco watcher who collaborated with us to craft the premise of this session. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 99 – The Case for Buy the Dip on Coupa, Snowflake & Zscaler – Buy the dip has been an effective strategy since the market bottomed in early March last year. The approach has been especially successful in tech and even more so for those tech names that: 1) were well-positioned for the forced march to digital – i.e. remote work, online commerce, data-centric platforms and certain cybersecurity plays; and 2) already had the cloud figured out. The question on investors’ minds is where to go from here. Should you avoid some of the high flyers that are richly valued with eye-popping multiples? Or should you continue to buy the dip? And if so, which companies that capitalized on the trends from last year will see permanent shifts in spending patterns that make them a solid long term play. In this Breaking Analysis we shine the spotlight on three companies that may be candidates for a buy the dip strategy over the next 3-5 years. To do so it’s our pleasure to welcome Ivana Delevska, the Chief Investment Officer and founder of SPEAR Alpha, a new, research-centric ETF focused on industrial technology. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 98 – Thinking Outside the Box…AWS Signals a New Era for Storage – By our estimates, AWS will generate around $9B in storage revenue this year and is now the second largest supplier of enterprise storage behind Dell. We believe AWS storage revenue will surpass $11B in 2022 and continue to outpace on-prem storage growth by more than 1,000 basis points for the next three to four years. At its third annual Storage Day event, AWS signaled a continued drive to think differently about data storage and transform the way customers migrate, manage and add value to their data over the next decade. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will give a brief overview of what we learned at AWS’ Storage Day, share our assessment of the big announcement of the day – a deal with NetApp to run the full ONTAP stack natively in the cloud as a managed service – and share some new data on how we see the market evolving. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 97 – Tech Earnings Signal a Continued Booming Market – Tech earnings reports from key enterprise software and infrastructure players this week, underscore that IT spending remains robust in the post isolation economy. This is especially true for those companies that have figured out a coherent and compelling cloud strategy. Despite COVID variant uncertainties and hardware component shortages, most leading tech names outperformed expectations. That said, investors weren’t in the mood to reward all stocks and any variability in product mix, earnings outlook or bookings/billings nuances were met with a tepid response from the street. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will provide our commentary and new data points on key technology companies including Snowflake, Salesforce, Workday, Splunk, Elastic, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, Dell, Pure Storage, HP Inc. and NetApp. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 96 – Can anyone tame the identity access beast? Okta aims to try… – Chief information security officers cite trust as the most important value attribute they can deliver to their organizations. And when it comes to security, identity is the new attack surface. As such, identity and access management continue to be the top priority among technology decision makers. It also happens to be one of the most challenging and complicated areas of the cyber security landscape. Okta, a leader in the identity space, has announced its intent to converge privilege access and identity governance in an effort to simplify the landscape and reimagine identity. Our research shows that interest in this type of consolidation is high, but organizations believe technical debt, compatibility issues, expense and lack of talent are barriers to reaching cyber nirvana with their evolving zero trust networks. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave will explore the complex and evolving world of identity access and privileged account management. With an assessment of Okta’s market expansion aspirations and fresh data from ETR and input from Erik Bradley. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 95 – Rethinking Data Protection in the 2020s – Techniques to protect sensitive data have evolved over thousands of years, literally. The pace of modern data protection is rapidly accelerating and presents both opportunities and threats for organizations. In particular, the amount of data stored in the cloud, combined with hybrid work models, the clear and present threat of cyber crime, regulatory edicts and ever-expanding edge use cases should put CxOs on notice that the time is now to rethink your data protection strategies. In this Breaking Analysis, Dave is going to explore the evolving world of data protection and share some data on how we see the market evolving and the competitive landscape for some of the top players. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 94 – Cyber, Cloud, Hybrid Work & Data Drive 8% IT Spending Growth in 2021 – Every CEO is figuring out the right balance for new hybrid business models. Regardless of the chosen approach, which will vary, technology executives understand they must accelerate digital and build resilience as well as optionality into their platforms. This is driving a dramatic shift in IT investments at the macro level as we expect total spending to increase at 8% in 2021, compared to last year’s contraction. Investments in cyber security, cloud, collaboration to enable hybrid work and data, including analytics, AI and automation are the top spending priorities for CxOs. In this Breaking Analysis Dave welcomes back Erik Bradley, Chief Engagement Strategist at our partner ETR. In this post we’ll share some takeaways from ETR’s latest survey and provide our commentary on what it means for markets, sellers and buyers. We’ll also explain what we think Wall Street is missing about Amazon’s latest earnings. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 93 – ServiceNow’s Collision Course with Salesforce.com – ServiceNow is a company that investors love to love. But there’s caution in the investor community right now as confusion about transitory inflation and higher interest rates looms. ServiceNow also suffers from perfection syndrome and elevated expectations. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will dig into ServiceNow, one of the companies we began following almost ten years ago, and provide some thoughts on ServiceNow’s march to $15B by 2026. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 92 – Survey Data Shows no Slowdown in AWS & Cloud Momentum – Despite all the chatter about cloud repatriation and the exorbitant cost of cloud computing, customer spending momentum continues to accelerate in the post isolation economy. If the pandemic was good for the cloud it seems that the benefits of cloud migration remain lasting in the late stages of COVID. And we believe this stickiness will continue. In this Breaking Analysis Dave will share some fresh July survey data that indicates accelerating momentum for the largest cloud computing firms. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 91 – How JPMC is Implementing a Data Mesh Architecture on the AWS Cloud – A new era of data is upon us. The technology industry generally and the data business specifically are in a state of transition. Even our language reflects that. For example, we rarely use the phrase “Big Data” anymore. Rather we talk about digital transformation or data-driven companies. In this Breaking Analysis we want to share our assessment of the state of the data business. We’ll do so by looking at the data mesh concept and how a division of a leading financial institution, JPMC, is practically applying these relatively new ideas to transform its data architecture for the next decade. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 90 – Mobile World Congress Highlights Telco Transformation – AMobile World Congress is on for 2021. theCUBE will be there and we’ll let you know if it’s alive and well. As we approach a delayed MWC it’s appropriate to reflect on the state of the telecoms industry. Let’s face it – the telcos have done a great job of keeping us all connected during the pandemic. In this Breaking Analysis we welcome a long time telecoms industry analyst and the Founding Director of Lewis Insight, Mr. Chris Lewis. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 89 – How AWS is Revolutionizing Systems Architecture – AWS is pointing the way to a revolution in system architecture. Much in the same way that AWS defined the cloud operating model last decade, we believe it is once again leading in future systems. In this Breaking Analysis we’ll dig into the moves that AWS has been making, explain how they got here, why we think this is transformational for the industry and what this means for customers, partners and AWS’ many competitors. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 88 – Learnings from the hottest startups in cyber & IT infrastructure – As you well know by now, the cloud is about shifting IT labor to more strategic initiatives. Or as Andy Jassy posited at the first AWS re:Invent conference in 2012, removing the undifferentiated heavy lifting associated with deploying and managing IT infrastructure. In this Breaking Analysis Dave is pleased to welcome a special guest, Erik Suppiger, author of the Elite 80 – a report that details the hottest privately held cybersecurity and IT infrastructure companies in the world. Erik is a senior analyst at JMP Securities and will share insights from this report. Watch the full video analysis. Episode 87 – Chasing Snowflake in Database Boomtown – Database is the heart of enterprise computing. The market is both growing rapidly and evolving. Major forces transforming the space include cloud and data – of course – but also new workloads, advanced memory and IO capabilities, new processor types, a massive push toward simplicity, new data sharing and governance models; and a spate of venture investment.

Title: The Best Of 2024 From AI Stock Analyst

We regret any inconvenience. The world today was engineered to be ephemeral and noisy. This is a terrible combination for an investor. On Twitter alone, there are 456,000 messages sent every minute. On Facebook, there are 510,000 comments posted every minute and 293,000 status updates. Outside of social media, there are 16 million text messages sent every minute and 156 million emails. NEW YORK, NEW YORK - MARCH 27: Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange during ... [+] afternoon trading on March 27, 2024 in New York City. Stocks closed out high with the Dow Jones leading closing over 400 points and is on pace to end March with its fifth straight positive month, the longest streak since August 2020 and the S&P snapping a three day streak of losses. (Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images) For an investor, the antidote to noise is quality stock analysis. Due diligence requires dozens of hours per equity, and it takes hundreds of hours every year to produce a free newsletter with quality analysis. My firm, the I/O Fund, strives to offer some of the team’s best analysis for free, and I believe the consistency and depth of what my firm provides for free is hard to replicate. My firm offers this in the most challenging sector for investors, which is hands-down the tech sector. The tech sector is unusually difficult because it involves many different verticals – artificial intelligence, crypto, consumer, media, cloud, and more. It’s also the highest risk and highest reward sector in the market. Due to sudden price movements in both directions, the stakes are high. Perhaps I am biased, but quality analysis particularly in the tech sector can be hard to come by. Below are highlights from my free analysis on Forbes during a strong year for AI and crypto. Although numerous investor favorites rose more than 100% during the year, many other popular tech stocks declined significantly. My firm offered our readers clues and insights for the leading stocks in AI semiconductors and software, providing unparalleled depth and quality to our free readers. Right out the gate in 2024, I expanded on my highly regarded 2021 prediction that Nvidia would surpass Apple’s valuation within 5 five years; which at the time, this prediction was inconceivable as it would require not only Nvidia to go up more than 300%, but also for the tech leader Apple to plateau. I explained why Nvidia would deliver on this prediction a whole 2 years early in the February 2024 analysis, Nvidia Stock Gained $1.5 Trillion To Surpass The FAANGs - Apple Is Next. In the analysis, I pointed out that it was not just the consistency and magnitude of Nvidia’s multi-billion dollar revenue beats, but the expansion of its margins and earnings as revenue grew >200% for multiple quarters as it approached a $90 billion annualized scale. From that August 2021 prediction to the February 2024 update, Nvidia posted some staggering growth numbers: · Data center revenue grew 676% to $18.4 billion. Data center revenue scaled from a $10 billion run rate to a $75 billion run rate in 2.5 years, a feat that took AWS 6 years to accomplish. · Nvidia’s total revenue increased 240% during the period driven by blazing data center growth, versus a 43% increase for Apple, with iPhone revenue rising just 4.5% from fiscal 2021 to fiscal 2023. · Nvidia’s quarterly EPS grew nearly 400% during the period, versus just 14% for Apple. · Nvidia’s operating margin increased from 47% to nearly 67%, while Apple’s expanded from 28% to 34%. My firm provided a handful of reasons that would propel Nvidia to quickly become the world’s most valuable company. This included the long runway for AI accelerators – AMD’s executives forecast the market to reach $400 billion by 2027 – with Nvidia taking the lion’s share. Nvidia’s accelerated product roadmap to a one-year release cadence lets it continue to pry away Big Tech capex, while the software opportunity beckons, already reaching a $1B+ run rate. These tailwinds combined with a valuation that was “eerily low” at the time considering the rapid ascent shares had made through 2023. Supply chain and demand signals point to 2025 being another strong year for Nvidia as Blackwell comes to market, with my firm tracking these data points to assess Nvidia’s growth potential in the year to come. I published numerous free analyses on Nvidia’s Blackwell; some of this explaining back in May why there was still room in the stock price as I called out institutional analyst estimates being too low (which later materialized). I also boldly wrote that delays on Blackwell were overblown, and we have gotten yet another confirmation from Nvidia’s management team at CES that Blackwell is shipping on time. My firm’s ongoing consistency and accuracy on this stock dating back to 2018 for up to 4,000% returns has been unparalleled —premium members received nine real-time buy alerts below $20 in 2021 and 2022; learn more here. · Nvidia Q1 Earnings Preview: Blackwell And The $200B Data Center · Nvidia Stock: Blackwell Suppliers Shrug Off Delay Ahead Of Q2 Earnings · Here’s Why Nvidia Stock Will Reach $10 Trillion Market Cap By 2030 · Nvidia Stock Is A Buy On Dips Before Blackwell Arrives In 2025 · Nvidia’s Stock Has 70% Potential Upside For 2025 My firm provided two crucial updates on our game plan for Bitcoin, with his first update from April 2024 increasing our target price zones. At the time, Bitcoin was an overlooked asset compared to the over-hyped Mag 7, yet the asset has delivered superior returns compared to all of the great large-cap tech stocks in this bull cycle, minus Nvidia, while having a low inverse correlation to tech. Utilizing technical analysis and on-chain data in the analysis We Are Raising Our Bitcoin Targets To $106K - $190K, my firm explained that it was now raising its target zones for Bitcoin to $106,000 to $190,000, up from the previous zone of $75,000 to $130,000. Bitcoin was trading in the mid-$60,000 range at the time, as my firm noted that “the $42,750 support region holds on any ongoing volatility, then we have no reason to doubt the uptrend in place.” My firm provided another update to the Bitcoin thesis at the end of July 2024 in the analysis, Bitcoin Update: Next Stop $100,000; Bitcoin finally surpassed that historic level as 2024 came to a close. My firm explained that Bitcoin had “a full corrective pattern in place that ended around $54,000 in early July,” which “suggests we are in the early stages of the next rally.” My firm had systematically been accumulating since the start of this cycle while raising our critical supports along the way — below is the history of Bitcoin buy alerts that my firm issued to our subscribers in real-time since early 2023. The I/O Fund sent out numerous buy alerts for BTC below $60,000 since early 2023. Notably, my firm assisted readers in capturing immense upside from the two top-performing large-cap tech positions in 2023 and 2024 with Nvidia and Bitcoin; the fact my firm also provided ongoing entries and risk management for these mega-winners should not be understated in terms of the value my firm has delivered.

In the January 2024 analysis, Social Media Stocks: One Metric Shows Meta’s Clear Leadership, I pointed out what separated Meta as a clear social media leader and why Snapchat would struggle with monetization. Since then, Meta shares have risen nearly 65%, while Snapchat has declined -28%. Meta was demonstrating improvements in ad pricing with strong ad impressions growth of >30% in Q2 and Q3 2023, while average revenue per user (ARPU) accelerated in those quarters; whereas Snapchat was struggling to effectively monetize its user base. Additionally, I explained that Meta was much more efficient with spending, maintaining R&D spending below 40% of gross profit while improving ARPU, significantly improving operating margin, and investing in AR/VR and AI technologies. Snapchat was “spending around 80% of its gross profit dollars on R&D,” a disproportionately high amount on R&D relative to peers while failing to increase ARPU and monetization within its user base.” I pointed out that what makes Meta a clear leader is that “it can maintain a high level of R&D spend … while remaining a cash cow with strong operating cash flow and free cash flow growth,” with OCF margin nearing 60% in Q3 2023 and OCF tracking for 50% YoY growth to $75 billion in 2023. In a follow-up analysis in March 2024, Top 3 Ad-Tech Stocks For 2024, I said that Meta’s “key metrics [were] supporting a return to >40% operating margin for the full year and a possible >33% net margin, driven by increasing ad pricing, strong engagement trends and impressions growth, aided by the release of numerous AI features.” Q3 2024’s results put this prediction very close to coming true, with 9M operating margin at 39.6% and net margin at 35.8%. In the February 2024 analysis AI Driving Acceleration For Big 3 Cloud Stocks, I discussed how AI was impacting cloud growth at Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet. For Amazon, I explained that in Q4 2023, “AWS finally accelerated in Q4 for the first time in 2 years, with Amazon reporting 13.2% growth in Q4, up just over 1 point from Q3’s 12%.” However, the more important metric was AWS’ operating leverage improving in the second half of 2023, with operating income growth at 3x the rate of revenue in Q4. At the time, AWS was generating the majority of Amazon’s company-wide operating income (67% of 2023) due to its higher operating margin (27% in Q4 2023), which I had said was “a trend that can strengthen with AI driving accelerated customer and revenue growth and decreased costs.” This has played out, with AWS reporting a 37.8% operating margin in Q3 2024. What I had seen in February 2024 was a combination of increased customer migrations, larger and longer duration contracts, increased incremental revenue QoQ, and opportunities to better monetize the suite via AI. These factors were the necessary ingredients for AWS to show “a sustained AI-driven acceleration,” even though its quarterly growth rates lagged Azure and Google Cloud. AWS growth has now re-accelerated to 19%. In a follow-up article in May, Amazon Stock: Nearing $2 Trillion Club From AWS Growth & Ads Catalyst, I provided evidence that AWS was a primary contributor to Amazon’s push to the $2 trillion milestone. I noted that AWS was contributing more than 60% of Amazon’s total operating income despite contributing less than 20% of total revenue, one reason that corporate gross profit margin has quickly approached 20% and operating margin reached double-digits for the first time ever, at 10.7%. Growth from AI quickly reached a multi-billion dollar run rate, while improvements in operating leverage at AWS aided Amazon’s bottom line and stock price — shares have risen nearly 30% since the February 2024 analysis. My firm was also early to call out a fundamental acceleration for one of 2024’s best performing AI stocks, alongside another AI-exposed ad-tech winner and an AI theme that quickly came to the forefront thanks to Nvidia. In December 2023, my firm outlined four cloud stocks set to see revenue accelerate in 2024, with Palantir one of the four. My firm had said that Palantir was “exhibiting multiple signs of acceleration heading into 2024 with an improved fundamental backdrop driven by increasing AI demand. Palantir’s Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) is driving a significant acceleration in its US commercial business, while underlying metrics and the bottom line are rapidly improving: Palantir posted its first GAAP profitable quarter in February and has since reported four consecutive GAAP profitable quarters.” My firm explained that “revenue growth is poised to accelerate in Q4 and through 2024, boosted by AI demand, a reacceleration in Palantir’s US government segment, and continued strength in the US commercial segment stemming from [AIP].” Palantir’s shares ended 2024 as the S&P 500’s best performer with a 341% return. In April 2024, my firm discussed Taiwan Semiconductor’s (TSMC) revenue acceleration stemming from the strength of AI/HPC revenue, with April sales surging after Q1 showed strong advanced node revenue growth and record HPC revenue. My firm discussed how TSMC was “riding the enormous wave of demand from Big Tech,” with HPC revenue rising 3% QoQ to $8.68 billion in Q1 2024, “a fresh record despite the first quarter typically being seasonally weaker.” Additionally, my firm said reports of “Nvidia and AMD fully booking out TSMC’s advanced packaging capacity through the end of 2025” lent “to a strong AI-driven outlook.” April’s sales numbers gave my firm confidence that TSMC was “on track to land in the upper half of or above the guided range” for Q2 revenue — it ultimately beat estimates by $500 million, the largest in more than two years. In June 2024, my firm published a thematic analysis on AI power consumption, and the rising power draw from next-generation GPUs. This analysis was underpinned by the “rise of generative AI and surging GPU shipments [which] is causing data centers to scale from tens of thousands to 100,000-plus accelerators, shifting the emphasis to power as a mission-critical problem to solve.” My firm explained how Nvidia’s Hopper and AMD’s MI300X accelerators consume 50% to 75% more power than the prior generation, while Blackwell represented “up to a 300% increase in power consumption across one generation of GPUs with AI systems increasing power consumption at a higher rate.” With power draw now quickly becoming mission-critical for data centers to address due to each generation of GPUs becoming increasingly more powerful than the last, my firm pointed out that this was driving a shift to liquid cooling. For 2025, my firm has worked to identify key Nvidia suppliers with Blackwell on deck to ramp significantly, sharing our in-depth research on the AI networking stack.

We are experiencing some temporary issues. The market data on this page is currently delayed. Please bear with us as we address this and restore your personalized lists. We recently compiled a list of the 12 Best Growth Stocks Under $25 to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Lumen Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:LUMN) stands against the other growth stocks. Most experts agree that the AI wave is not over yet. On January 8, Wendy Sheehan Donnell, Editor-in-Chief at PCMag, joined Yahoo Finance from CES 2025 to share her take on trending innovations and the increasing role of artificial intelligence in revolutionizing industries. Donnell unveiled some of the groundbreaking innovations spearheaded by companies from across the globe and emphasized that "AI is the prevailing theme" across all these new products and services. She highlighted the incidence of AI-powered home devices such as smart microwaves and fridges to help people live smarter and tech-immersed lives. She also shed light on the growing role of AI in healthcare and biotechnology, which will contribute to the well-being of people. The market close on Tuesday reiterated a similar pattern where tech stocks continued to shine, however, some analysts expect the market to broaden over the course of 2025. On January 7, Joe Mazzola, head trading and derivatives strategist at Charles Schwab, joined Yahoo Finance, to discuss his market thesis for the tech sector especially. Mazzola suggested that the market breadth was of importance in the earnings season, and pointed towards the strengthening of the US dollar and how it may impact the earnings of tech names. He added that the market needs the other "493 names" in the S&P 500 to catch up. Mazolla also emphasized that while 2025 can be a win for Big Tech like 2024, a broadening would help the overall market immensely in terms of earnings. He added that the financials sector would supposedly catalyze the broadening of the market, because of favorable economic and market conditions. He then discussed the tailwinds for financials and how the same factors serve as headwinds to Big Tech, emphasizing that the bullishness on tech has been slower than it was at the end of 2024. Our Methodology We used Finviz to look for companies operating in growth sectors such as technology, financials (fintech), biotech, and communication services. We only focused on companies with a market cap of at least $2 billion and that gained more than 50% over the past 2 quarters. We then examined the hedge fund sentiment surrounding 25 stocks and picked the 12 stocks that were the most widely held by hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Close-up of a technician's hands adjusting a communication router. Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 26 Share Price as of January 8, 2024: $5.55 Lumen Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:LUMN) is a telecommunications company offering cloud solutions, network services, security services, and other managed services. The company offers its services to multiple leading names such as Zoom, Vikings, VSP Vision, Seattle Seahawks, BlackStar Group, and Horizon Bank. Over the past few months, the company has expanded its services and line-up by partnering with key stakeholders in the technology sector. For instance, on November 5, Lumen Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:LUMN) announced a partnership with Google Cloud to speed up its digital transformation and innovation process. The partnership will allow Lumen to power AIOps and provide data insights across its network using Google Cloud. Similarly, in October, LUMN announced a partnership with Meta to help the company accelerate its AI goals. The company's partnerships and collaborations with tech giants have significantly boosted its position in the industry. In addition to that, the advent of AI has pushed the stock higher. 26 hedge funds were bullish on the stock at the end of Q3 2024. Overall LUMN ranks 8th on our list of the best growth stocks under $25 to buy now. While we acknowledge the potential of LUMN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than LUMN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

In the January 2024 analysis, Social Media Stocks: One Metric Shows Meta’s Clear Leadership, I pointed out what separated Meta as a clear social media leader and why Snapchat would struggle with monetization. Since then, Meta shares have risen nearly 65%, while Snapchat has declined -28%. Meta was demonstrating improvements in ad pricing with strong ad impressions growth of >30% in Q2 and Q3 2023, while average revenue per user (ARPU) accelerated in those quarters; whereas Snapchat was struggling to effectively monetize its user base. Additionally, I explained that Meta was much more efficient with spending, maintaining R&D spending below 40% of gross profit while improving ARPU, significantly improving operating margin, and investing in AR/VR and AI technologies. Snapchat was “spending around 80% of its gross profit dollars on R&D,” a disproportionately high amount on R&D relative to peers while failing to increase ARPU and monetization within its user base.” I pointed out that what makes Meta a clear leader is that “it can maintain a high level of R&D spend … while remaining a cash cow with strong operating cash flow and free cash flow growth,” with OCF margin nearing 60% in Q3 2023 and OCF tracking for 50% YoY growth to $75 billion in 2023. In a follow-up analysis in March 2024, Top 3 Ad-Tech Stocks For 2024, I said that Meta’s “key metrics [were] supporting a return to >40% operating margin for the full year and a possible >33% net margin, driven by increasing ad pricing, strong engagement trends and impressions growth, aided by the release of numerous AI features.” Q3 2024’s results put this prediction very close to coming true, with 9M operating margin at 39.6% and net margin at 35.8%. In the February 2024 analysis AI Driving Acceleration For Big 3 Cloud Stocks, I discussed how AI was impacting cloud growth at Microsoft, Amazon and Alphabet. For Amazon, I explained that in Q4 2023, “AWS finally accelerated in Q4 for the first time in 2 years, with Amazon reporting 13.2% growth in Q4, up just over 1 point from Q3’s 12%.” However, the more important metric was AWS’ operating leverage improving in the second half of 2023, with operating income growth at 3x the rate of revenue in Q4. At the time, AWS was generating the majority of Amazon’s company-wide operating income (67% of 2023) due to its higher operating margin (27% in Q4 2023), which I had said was “a trend that can strengthen with AI driving accelerated customer and revenue growth and decreased costs.” This has played out, with AWS reporting a 37.8% operating margin in Q3 2024. What I had seen in February 2024 was a combination of increased customer migrations, larger and longer duration contracts, increased incremental revenue QoQ, and opportunities to better monetize the suite via AI. These factors were the necessary ingredients for AWS to show “a sustained AI-driven acceleration,” even though its quarterly growth rates lagged Azure and Google Cloud. AWS growth has now re-accelerated to 19%. In a follow-up article in May, Amazon Stock: Nearing $2 Trillion Club From AWS Growth & Ads Catalyst, I provided evidence that AWS was a primary contributor to Amazon’s push to the $2 trillion milestone. I noted that AWS was contributing more than 60% of Amazon’s total operating income despite contributing less than 20% of total revenue, one reason that corporate gross profit margin has quickly approached 20% and operating margin reached double-digits for the first time ever, at 10.7%. Growth from AI quickly reached a multi-billion dollar run rate, while improvements in operating leverage at AWS aided Amazon’s bottom line and stock price — shares have risen nearly 30% since the February 2024 analysis. My firm was also early to call out a fundamental acceleration for one of 2024’s best performing AI stocks, alongside another AI-exposed ad-tech winner and an AI theme that quickly came to the forefront thanks to Nvidia. In December 2023, my firm outlined four cloud stocks set to see revenue accelerate in 2024, with Palantir one of the four. My firm had said that Palantir was “exhibiting multiple signs of acceleration heading into 2024 with an improved fundamental backdrop driven by increasing AI demand. Palantir’s Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) is driving a significant acceleration in its US commercial business, while underlying metrics and the bottom line are rapidly improving: Palantir posted its first GAAP profitable quarter in February and has since reported four consecutive GAAP profitable quarters.” My firm explained that “revenue growth is poised to accelerate in Q4 and through 2024, boosted by AI demand, a reacceleration in Palantir’s US government segment, and continued strength in the US commercial segment stemming from [AIP].” Palantir’s shares ended 2024 as the S&P 500’s best performer with a 341% return. In April 2024, my firm discussed Taiwan Semiconductor’s (TSMC) revenue acceleration stemming from the strength of AI/HPC revenue, with April sales surging after Q1 showed strong advanced node revenue growth and record HPC revenue. My firm discussed how TSMC was “riding the enormous wave of demand from Big Tech,” with HPC revenue rising 3% QoQ to $8.68 billion in Q1 2024, “a fresh record despite the first quarter typically being seasonally weaker.” Additionally, my firm said reports of “Nvidia and AMD fully booking out TSMC’s advanced packaging capacity through the end of 2025” lent “to a strong AI-driven outlook.” April’s sales numbers gave my firm confidence that TSMC was “on track to land in the upper half of or above the guided range” for Q2 revenue — it ultimately beat estimates by $500 million, the largest in more than two years. In June 2024, my firm published a thematic analysis on AI power consumption, and the rising power draw from next-generation GPUs. This analysis was underpinned by the “rise of generative AI and surging GPU shipments [which] is causing data centers to scale from tens of thousands to 100,000-plus accelerators, shifting the emphasis to power as a mission-critical problem to solve.” My firm explained how Nvidia’s Hopper and AMD’s MI300X accelerators consume 50% to 75% more power than the prior generation, while Blackwell represented “up to a 300% increase in power consumption across one generation of GPUs with AI systems increasing power consumption at a higher rate.” With power draw now quickly becoming mission-critical for data centers to address due to each generation of GPUs becoming increasingly more powerful than the last, my firm pointed out that this was driving a shift to liquid cooling. For 2025, my firm has worked to identify key Nvidia suppliers with Blackwell on deck to ramp significantly, sharing our in-depth research on the AI networking stack.

Sean Pyles: Well, here we are. It's a new year. Time to take stock of how things are going with our investments. Are you thinking maybe it's time to take a bit more risk or are you looking at your portfolio and wondering if it's time to pull back? We've got some ways for you to consider all the options for investing in your financial future. Sam Taube: I do believe that people should generally build a safe and boring portfolio of index funds first and then they can speculate with whatever money they've got left over, and I'm practicing what I preach there. Sean Pyles: Welcome to NerdWallet's Smart Money podcast. I'm Sean Pyles. Sam Taube: And I'm Sam Taube. Sean Pyles: It's 2025. Do you know how your stocks are doing? Are you doing that classic new year exercise of checking the batteries in your fire detector and rebalancing your portfolio? Will you be investing some time in your investing strategy? It's a great time of year to do that, and Sam, today we've got a whole slew of tips for getting started. Sam Taube: Yes, we do, and let's say upfront what we always say at the end of the show, which is that we are not investment advisors, and this nerdy investment info is for general educational purposes only. It may not apply to your specific circumstances. That said, a lot of us touch the investing world in some way, whether it's through retirement accounts, college savings plans, or maybe a health savings account. Sean Pyles: The latest Federal Reserve survey of consumer finances showed that some 58% of US households had some sort of stock ownership as part of their finances. That was the highest number on record. The survey measured the year 2019 to 2022, so it included the COVID era and the meme stock era, for whatever that's worth. Sam Taube: For some people, that era was worth a lot. For others, not so much. That Fed survey is also borne out by another survey, this time the Economy and Personal Finance survey from Gallup. That one found that around 62% of American adults invest in stocks. That's everything from what we already mentioned—savings for retirement or college—to people holding individual stock portfolios. If you're interested in investing, well, you have a lot of company. Sean Pyles: Sam, how about you tell us exactly what's going to happen in the stock market this year so we can all make a lot of money? Sam Taube: I would be a very rich man if I could do that, but unfortunately, I can't. Sean Pyles: Bummer. Sam Taube: What we can do here is prepare for both the best and the worst, and make it so that the daily stock market gyrations don't factor that much into our overall well-being. Our goal today is to make that possible for you. Sean Pyles: Fair enough. We want to hear what you think too, listeners. What are you working on in your financial life as we start the new year? Leave us a voicemail or text the Nerd hotline at (901) 720-6373. That's 901-730-N-E-R-D, or email a voice memo to [email protected]. Sam, last week we talked with fellow Nerd and chief economist, Elizabeth Renter, about financial regrets. Let me ask you to gaze back on last year and talk about what the investing year was like, and maybe some regrets or at least lessons we might be able to take away from it. Sam Taube: It was a rip-roaring year for a lot of different kinds of investments. The S&P 500 was up over 25% year-to-date by early December, which is when we're recording this. That's an exceptionally good return compared to the long-term average of 10% per year. It was also a really big year for crypto. Bitcoin more than doubled in price last year, and certain tech stocks did even better than that. Nvidia shareholders, for example, almost tripled their money last year. If you spend enough time on social media, you find stories of people who have gotten very rich very quickly from big bets on these things over the last year. If you weren't one of those people, it's easy to get retroactive FOMO about it. Sean Pyles: Yeah, I feel that. Sam Taube: In truth, if you diversify your investments enough, you're not really missing out. As a personal example, I did not own individual shares of Nvidia at any point last year, but I did indirectly profit from Nvidia's gains because I own S&P 500 index funds, which contain Nvidia. My returns for the year were probably lower than someone who went all in on that single stock. On the other hand, that person was probably a lot more stressed about their investment than I was. Sean Pyles: Let's talk about some of the standout sectors that did especially well or especially poorly. I know you were all over the Nvidia story and came on the show a couple of times to talk about it. What were some other winners? Sam Taube: Tech in general had a pretty good year. The NASDAQ composite is actually doing even better than the S&P 500 at the time of recording in late 2024. There's still a lot of hype for certain kinds of AI and semiconductor-related companies like Taiwan Semiconductor, and as we previously mentioned, Nvidia. They've kind of carried the tech sector this year. Another sector that outperformed the market in 2024 was communications. There's a blurred line between communications and tech. For example, Meta, which was formerly known as Facebook, had a really great year, as have certain kinds of big media conglomerates like Disney and Netflix. Another big outperformer last year was the financial services sector. A lot of the big banks like Goldman Sachs and Bank of America also outperformed the market by quite a bit, and then, as we mentioned, crypto had a really great year. Sean Pyles: That's right. My Dogecoin shot up quite a bit after the election. As of this recording, it's at a whopping 38 cents, and it was often much, much lower, maybe closer to 1 cent at different points in the year. I'm really proud of the performance of my joke cryptocurrency. Sam Taube: Congrats. Sean Pyles: So, Sam, how about some loser industries in 2024? Sam Taube: The energy sector was kind of a laggard last year. It had a positive return, but less than the S&P 500. The performance of oil and gas stocks, generally speaking, is very dependent on the market price of oil, and that has actually decreased slightly over the course of 2024. You might think that poor performance in the fossil fuel industry would mean that clean energy has done well, but that has not been the case. Clean energy, particularly solar, has actually had a really rough year. The Invesco Solar ETF, which is sometimes used as a benchmark for the solar industry, was down almost 30% last year, despite the strong performance of so many other stocks. Sean Pyles: What, if anything, do these poor performers tell us about what might be coming for the markets in 2025? Sam Taube: A lot of these trends, both the winners and some of the losers, are likely related to the election. There's a theory that the stock market was anticipating that President-elect Donald Trump would win. Many of these trends may reflect expected changes in government policy or regulations that have been priced into the market over the last year. For example, the Biden administration has made some moves toward trying to break up some of the big monopolistic tech companies. Shareholders in that industry may be betting that those antitrust actions are just going to go away under Trump. Another thing that's really important for the tech industry is there's a perception that we may be getting a looser regulatory approach to AI under Trump than we might've gotten under Vice President Kamala Harris. Bank shareholders may also be anticipating looser regulations. In his first term, Trump loosened some of the banking regulations that were put in place after the 2008 financial crisis, and there's a chance he may do more of that in his second term. It's a similar deal with crypto. Markets may be just betting on less regulation in that space. Sean Pyles: Going back to the clean energy industry, do you think the dip there is also election-related? Sam Taube: There is a good case for it. The solar industry, in particular, has really benefited from tax credits under Biden, and shareholders may be predicting that those tax credits won't last. But there's an important caveat here, which is that there are a lot of assumptions in this thinking. We don't necessarily know what's going to come out of this new administration, and if these policy changes I've talked about don't happen — say the new government doesn't loosen banking regulations or it keeps the solar tax credit going — then these trends that we've been talking about might reverse somewhat. Sean Pyles: The main stock indices — S&P 500, Dow — hit new records last year over and over again. What does that mean historically? The saying is that what goes up must come down, but what do we know about how markets and investors behave in an environment of rising stock prices? Sam Taube: "What goes up must come down" is very true in physics, but in some ways, the inverse is true when we're talking about the stock market. When it comes to stock indexes like the S&P 500, it's kind of "what goes down must come up." Bear markets do happen, and they can feel really gnarly while they're happening, but they're generally followed by much longer bull markets that tend to surpass previous highs by quite a bit. Since 1932, the average S&P 500 bear market has lasted less than two years. The average bull market, on the other hand, has lasted more than four years, and we just had a bear market in 2022. History suggests that we've got a lot more upside ahead, even after a very strong 2024. Sean Pyles: At a high level, Sam, should we even pay attention when we hear news items about stocks hitting records? Sam Taube: For long-term investors, I can't really think of an immediate action anyone needs to take when we hit a new high, but it's something to keep in mind. A lot of people set up their portfolio to contain a particular mix of stocks and bonds, say 80% stocks, 20% bonds, and when we have a really strong year in the stock market, it can sometimes mess up those proportions. If stocks go up more than bonds, you might log into your retirement account or whatever after a while away and find that you now have a 90:10 stock and bond portfolio. This is why financial advisors recommend rebalancing your portfolio once or twice a year, which you mentioned at the beginning of this episode. That means selling off some of the investments that have done really well and then using the proceeds to purchase some more of the investments that have lagged so that you maintain your target mix over time. Sean Pyles: Okay. We're going to take a short break. We are back in a moment with more investing information for 2025. Stay with us. Sean Pyles: Sam, it's time to get personal. How are you approaching investing in 2025? Doing anything different, new, exciting, boring? What are you keeping your eye on? Sam Taube: I'm mostly very boring. Almost all my investments are in index funds, and I'm planning to hold them for years. For the most part, I'm just going to keep holding and adding money to them in 2025. I do also have a tiny amount of Bitcoin and Ethereum. It's spare money, and I don't have a particularly strong investment thesis for it, but one Bitcoin was worth a few hundred dollars in the early 2010s, and recently, it passed a hundred thousand dollars. I want to see what it does in the years ahead. In our line of work, people can sometimes sound a little bit scoldy when we talk about high-risk speculative investments like crypto. I don't know if it's realistic to tell people that they should never, ever touch stuff like that. I know how risky crypto is, but I'm a human being, and I'm curious about it. But I do believe that people should generally build a safe and boring portfolio of index funds first, and then they can speculate with whatever money they've got left over, and I'm practicing what I preach there. Sean Pyles: I think that's good advice. You cover your fundamentals first, make sure that you are saving and investing for retirement, and then if you have some leftover cash, maybe dabble a bit in other areas. But I think if people are putting all of their money into crypto for retirement, that's a very risky, potentially dangerous idea. Sam Taube: Exactly. Very well said. Sean Pyles: Let's talk about how to get into investing if it's something that you're not already immersed in but maybe want to experiment with, especially outside of retirement and other savings funds. With the caveat once again that we are not investment advisors, what's a good way to dip a toe into the stock market waters—or maybe the bond waters if that's your thing? Sam Taube: The first step is going to be to open an investment account if you don't have one. NerdWallet has some really helpful roundups of the best brokerage accounts if you don't know where to look. Once you have an account, you need to put some money in, and then you also need to invest that money. I've mentioned index funds a couple of times already. For listeners who don't know, these are baskets of stocks that mirror the performance of a stock market index like the S&P 500. They're really good for beginners. The nice thing about S&P 500 index funds and most other index funds is that they give you exposure to dozens or hundreds of stocks in a single purchase. They're pretty low maintenance. You don't really have to research the individual stocks or worry about whether or not they're doing better or worse than the overall market because index funds just give you the overall market's return. Sean Pyles: And what are some red flags to keep an eye out for if you are new to the investing world? Sam Taube: There's a lot of bad faith and scammy information out there, and I think a big red flag is any kind of promised return. If you come across some crypto product or investment guru or something who promises that they can double your money in a year, that's probably a scam. A milder red flag is if someone or something is bragging about its past returns. If you go on TikTok, you can find these stock-picking gurus who advertise themselves by bragging about the big 500% score they made on Nvidia options last year or whatever the case may be. The thing is, even if that claim is legitimate, past performance doesn't guarantee future performance. It's still good to be skeptical of any kind of influencer or financial product that advertises itself that way. There's a common thread here, which is to be aware of things that sound like get-rich-quick schemes. If it seems too good to be true, there's a good chance that it is. Sean Pyles: Sam, what are some ways to figure out which investing platform is best for you? There are so many apps and websites out there. What advice do you have for picking one over another? What factors should people be considering? Sam Taube: The best investing platform for a particular person is going to depend on their goals and also on their skill level. Again, I'm going to plug NerdWallet's roundups here because we have a whole bunch of them that cater to different kinds of needs. If you're looking for a retirement account, we have a roundup of the best IRAs. If you're really new to investing, we have a roundup of the best brokerage accounts for beginners. If you're more experienced and you're looking to trade options, we have a roundup of the best brokerage accounts for options, too. On each of these roundups, we have a really easy-to-read table that lists each broker's fees, account minimums, active promotions, and our NerdWallet rating, and also detailed pros and cons lists for each one. We want to make it easy for you to do all your comparison shopping in one place. Of course, we'll include a link to those in today's show notes. Sean Pyles: Sam, I wonder if you could talk a bit about the relative importance of stock markets in our financial lives. There's a common saying that the stock market is not the economy, right? Yes, it's a large part of the financial world, but would you agree that it's not the end-all, be-all? When we hear news headlines about the stock market, we need to understand that there are other aspects of the economy that are just as important. Sam Taube: Absolutely. For that matter, if you're really just starting out from square one financially, investing probably isn't even going to be your top priority, and ditto if you're trying to recover from some kind of setback or get out of debt. Many advisors would say that building up an emergency fund and paying down high-interest debts like credit card debt are good things to tackle before you even start thinking about long-term savings and investments. Sean Pyles: Very sound advice. Sam Taube, thank you so much for helping us out today. Sam Taube: Always great to be here. Sean Pyles: And be sure to join us next week as we continue to look at your money in 2025. We're going to hear all about budgeting and how to manage your credit life. Kim Palmer: The main caution to watch out for with credit cards is overspending. Credit cards can just be really tricky because it doesn't necessarily feel like real money, and other than the credit limit on the card, there's really nothing stopping us to keep swiping away to buy what we want.

Title: What’s Happening With eBay Stock?
URL: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2025/01/09/whats-happening-with-ebay-stock/
Time Published: 2025-01-09T14:24:22Z
Full Content:
POLAND - 2024/12/17: In this photo illustration, the eBay company logo is seen displayed on a ... [+] smartphone screen. (Photo Illustration by Piotr Swat/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) The stock price of eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) saw a 10% jump on Wednesday, January 8, after Meta announced that it would allow certain eBay listings to appear on Facebook Marketplace. A collaboration with Meta might strengthen eBay’s competitive standing in the e-commerce landscape. eBay has been struggling with falling gross merchandise volume, which fell from$87.4 billion in 2021 to $73.2 billion in 2023, due to a challenging macroeconomic environment. Higher inflation and weak consumer sentiment have weighed on the company’s top-line growth. However, the company has seen a slight recovery in 2024. The recent move from Meta will help eBay improve its GMV, given the solid traffic Facebook sees. For Meta, this move comes after the European Commission imposed a penalty over alleged anticompetitive practices in its online classifieds business. eBay stock has had a good past year – thanks to the recovery in GMV. It was up 45% in 2024, outperforming the broader S&P 500 index, up 23%. Looking at a slightly longer period, eBay has seen its stock rise 75% from levels of $40 in early 2023 to $63 now. This can be attributed to: eBay’s revenue growth lately has been driven by growth in its focus categories, which includes auto parts and accessories, collectibles, handbags, refurbished goods, and luxury fashion. This has helped it see higher GMV and take rate over the recent quarters. The company has been targeting AI to bolster its sales by offering personalized recommendations. Its focus on certain categories, such as auto parts and accessories, seems to be working well for the company. Still, eBay faces tough competition from the likes of Amazon, Walmart, Etsy, and Temu, among others. Separately, look at What’s Happening With RGTI Stock? Looking at the company’s profitability, its operating margin declined from 24% in 2022 to 21.3% now. Given the fall in revenue and operating margin, eBay’s adjusted net income declined from $2.7 billion in 2022 to $2.4 billion now. However, its share repurchases helped the bottom line expand from $4.02 to $4.69 over this period. Although EBAY has outperformed the broader markets lately, the increase in EBAY stock over the recent years has been far from consistent, with annual returns being more volatile than the S&P 500. Returns for the stock were 34% in 2021, -36% in 2022, 8% in 2023, and 45% in 2024. While EBAY stock has seen mixed growth over recent years, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark S&P 500 index over the last four year period; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment around rate cuts and weak consumer sentiment, could EBAY face a similar situation as it did in 2022 and 2023 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months — or will it see a strong jump?

Recent statistical approaches have shown that the set of all available genetic variants explains considerably more phenotypic variance of complex traits and diseases than the individual variants that are robustly associated with these phenotypes. However, rapidly increasing sample sizes constantly improve detection and prioritization of individual variants driving the associations between genomic regions and phenotypes. Therefore, it is useful to routinely estimate how much phenotypic variance the detected variants explain for each region by taking into account the correlation structure of variants and the uncertainty in their causal status. Here we extend the FINEMAP software to estimate the effect sizes and regional heritability under the probabilistic model that assumes a handful of causal variants per region. Using the UK Biobank (UKB) data to simulate genomic regions, we demonstrate that FINEMAP provides higher precision and enables more detailed decomposition of regional heritability into individual variants than the variance component model implemented in BOLT or the fixed-effect model implemented in HESS, particularly when there are only a few causal variants in the fine-mapped region. Using data from 2,940 plasma proteins from the UKB study, we observed that on average FINEMAP identified 2.5 causal variants at an association signal and captured 36% more regional heritability than the variant with the lowest P-value. We estimate that in genomic regions with notable contribution to the total heritability, FINEMAP captures on average 13% and 40% more heritability than BOLT and HESS respectively. Our analysis shows how FINEMAP, BOLT and HESS relate to each other in cases where inference of a variant-level picture of the regional genetic architecture is possible. Advancements in statistical methodologies to analyze Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have revealed that numerous genetic variants across the whole genome significantly contribute to the phenotypic variation in quantitative traits and disease risk. As sample sizes in GWAS grow, there is a continuous improvement in identifying and prioritizing individual variants that drive associations between genomic regions and phenotypes. To better understand both the individual and joint contribution of these variants to phenotypic variation, we extend the FINEMAP software to simultaneously estimate effect sizes of individual variants and heritability of genomic regions. Using simulations, we study how regional heritability estimates of FINEMAP and existing heritability approaches relate to each other and when a fine-mapping model is able to accurately narrow down the regional heritability into contributions from individual variants. In the analysis of plasma biomarkers, we demonstrate that FINEMAP offers more precise regional heritability estimates than existing heritability approaches in genomic regions that contribute notably to the total heritability. These new features in FINEMAP enable routine comparisons between the regional heritability estimates originating from different modeling assumptions, and inform us about the genetic architecture of each genomic region.

Over the last decade, GWAS have accumulated a massive catalog of robust statistical associations between numerous genomic regions and complex traits or diseases [1]. Typically, genetic variants highlighted by GWAS explain only a small fraction of total phenotypic variation (the missing heritability problem [2]) and are clustered into clumps of even hundreds of highly correlated variants giving rise to the fine-mapping problem [3]. The missing heritability problem has spurred highly successful methodological research in variance components models to evaluate the heritability contribution from the whole genome, not just from the statistically significantly associated variants [4–6]. Software packages implementing variance component models include EMMAX [7], GCTA [8], GEMMA [9], MMM [10] and BOLT [5]. Common to these implementations is the requirement of individual-level genotype-phenotype data and the assumption that the phenotype has a polygenic architecture under which all variants are causal with tiny effects. Heritability estimation using a polygenic model has also been carried out with LD Score regression [6] and a polygenic score method AVENGEME [11] from GWAS summary statistics without access to the original genotype-phenotype data. Together these methods have considerably narrowed the gap between estimated SNP heritability and heritability estimates from twin studies for many phenotypes and, importantly, shed light on the genetic architecture and enrichment of functional genetic variation in complex traits and diseases [12–13]. With increasing statistical power of GWAS comes a possibility to narrow the heritability down into specific regions of the genome. Heritability estimation in genomic regions from GWAS summary statistics was introduced in the software package HESS [14] under the assumption of arbitrary genetic architecture and a fixed-effect model for causal effect sizes. HESS estimates heritability through a regularized quadratic form built on marginal effect size estimates of all variants and their pairwise correlations to account for Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) between them. HESS was shown to be more accurate than LD Score regression in regional heritability estimation on simulated data when both methods were run with pairwise correlations either from the original genotype data or a reference panel. Although polygenic and fixed-effect models have been very useful approaches for the estimation of genome-wide or regional heritability, the model assumptions of polygenicity or arbitrary genetic architecture likely leave room for improvement in accuracy if regional heritability can be attributed to only a few causal variants. Furthermore, our ultimate goal is to pinpoint the individual variants contributing to heritability and obtain accurate effect size estimates for them. Because existing heritability estimation methods do not provide such information, we turn to the fine-mapping framework instead. The decisive solution to the fine-mapping problem is often hindered by the lack of information due to small effect sizes, high LD between variants and imperfect genotype information. Therefore, many recent fine-mapping methods [15–19] implement principled probabilistic quantification of causal variants that can then be used for downstream analyses. As GWAS sample sizes are soon counted in millions providing unprecedented accuracy for statistical fine-mapping, it would be useful to routinely evaluate how much of the regional heritability can be explained by the fine-mapped variants. In particular, we may expect that fine-mapping captures a large part of the regional heritability in 1) molecular endophenotypes with moderate to large effect sizes at causal variants, and 2) in large-scale biobank projects and ongoing GWAS meta-analyses with adequate statistical power to detect most individual causal variants even with smaller effect sizes. On the other hand, fine-mapping is likely not informative in regions with only tiny effect sizes or in GWAS with very small sample sizes. In cases where the fine-mapping seems to explain the total regional heritability, we have a much more informative picture of the regional architecture than is given by the existing heritability estimation methods that do not identify individual causal variants. Therefore, we have extended the FINEMAP software [18] to provide estimates of effect sizes and regional heritability. Our previously published FINEMAP algorithm (version 1.1) [18] worked only with small causal effect sizes and did not provide estimates of effect sizes or regional heritability. Here we introduce FINEMAP version 1.4 that estimates causal effects of arbitrary magnitude and estimates regional heritability by accounting for the uncertainty of the causal configuration and the LD-adjusted joint effect sizes of causal variants. We compare regional heritability estimation using FINEMAP with both the variance component model implemented in BOLT and the fixed-effect model implemented in HESS. Ideally, with such comparisons, we can evaluate how much of the total regional heritability we capture with fine-mapped variants. Previously, Gusev et al. [20] have studied how the variance explained by the variant with the lowest P-value of a GWAS region compares to the results of a variance component model applied to the same region. They reported that on average the variance component model explained 1.29 times more heritability over nine diseases. We use plasma level concentrations of 2,940 unique proteins from the UKB, with a broad spectrum of genome-wide heritability levels. As an example where both FINEMAP and BOLT give a similar estimate of about 41% regional heritability, we study in detail the association between the PON1 gene and Paraoxonase 1 levels. To interpret the results from our protein data analysis more generally, we also perform a simulation study to evaluate FINEMAP, BOLT and HESS under different genetic architectures. As our ultimate goal is to narrow down the polygenic regional heritability into individual variants, it is useful to know how the heritability estimates of FINEMAP, BOLT and HESS relate to each other in cases where such decomposition is indeed possible. More generally, an ability to do routine comparisons between the regional heritability estimates originating from different modeling assumptions, including a fine-mapping model, further informs us about the genetic architecture of each region. We start with a motivating example of a region with a large contribution to the total heritability. Next, we study by simulation how a fine-mapping method FINEMAP, a variance component model BOLT and a fixed-effect heritability estimation model HESS perform more generally. Finally, we apply the methods to estimate the regional heritability of Protein Quantitative Trait Loci (pQTLs). Paraoxonase 1 (PON1) is a protein encoded by the PON1 gene on chromosome 7. Serum levels of PON1 have been reported to be reversely associated with systemic oxidative stress and atherosclerosis risk [21]. The strongest genetic associations with the serum level of PON1 were indeed located near the PON1 gene, which agrees with an earlier GWAS [21]. We applied FINEMAP on a 5.9Mb genomic region around the PON1 gene with 1,095 variants. FINEMAP estimated that with over 95% probability 16 variants are needed to explain the association signal and the fine-mapped variants together explain a heritability of h2 = 0.42 (CI0.95: 0.40–0.43) which is considerably more than the lead variant rs854560 alone (h2 = 0.21, CI0.95: 0.20–0.22). The top configuration from FINEMAP included 16 variants which were compared to the top 16 variants identified by the stepwise conditioning (S1 Table). The log-likelihood difference was 48.2 in favor of the configuration identified by FINEMAP demonstrating the efficiency of the search algorithm of FINEMAP compared to the stepwise conditional analysis. BOLT estimated regional h2 = 0.41 (CI0.95: 0.39–0.44) which was similar to the estimate from FINEMAP but with a wider confidence interval. HESS with the default regularization gave an unexpectedly small value h2 = 0.33 (CI0.95: 0.32–0.34), that was larger than the marginal heritability contribution of the lead variant alone but clearly smaller than FINEMAP and BOLT. HESS without regularization of the LD matrix yielded a value h2 = 0.53 (CI0.95: 0.52–0.54) that was much larger than the values from FINEMAP and BOLT. As a conclusion, the PON1 cis-pQTL is an example of a large effect region where FINEMAP provides fine-mapping that is statistically preferred over both the stepwise conditioning and single-variant analysis, and produces heritability estimates that are more detailed and more precise than the results from BOLT or HESS. However, paraoxonase 1 levels are an extreme case with a very large regional heritability contribution from the cis-pQTL and low polygenicity for the levels of PON1 outside of the PON1 locus (BOLT h2 = 0.06, CI0.95: 0.02–0.10). Therefore, we next performed simulation studies to assess more generally the performance of FINEMAP, BOLT and HESS under different genetic architectures. Using datasets on 100 GWAS regions, we evaluated heritability estimation implemented in FINEMAP, HESS and BOLT in simulations with three randomly chosen causal variants. This setting of a very sparse genetic architecture is particularly suitable for FINEMAP and we are interested in how BOLT and HESS perform relative to FINEMAP in order to later interpret results from our protein data analysis. The FINEMAP results verified our implementation as the estimates were nearly unbiased and the precision increased with the sample size (Fig 1 and S2A Table). When the sample size was small or the heritability was low, FINEMAP tended to underestimate the heritability but this effect disappeared with increasing sample size. This phenomenon shows how our prior distributions favor sparse models and smaller effect sizes in cases where the information in the data is weak, but how the effect of the priors diminishes with more informative data. However, when the heritability is tiny and the data are uninformative (n = 5,000, h2 = 0.025%), FINEMAP can also overestimate the heritability (Fig 1A and S2A Table). BOLT was downwardly biased for the larger heritabilities but upwardly biased for the smaller heritabilities (Fig 1 and S2A Table). The downward bias for the large heritabilities may result from a clear violation of the polygenic model whereas the upward bias for the small heritabilities may exist because BOLT constrains the REML-estimates to reside in the interval [0,1] and hence can overestimate heritability values close to zero. Root mean square error (RMSE) of BOLT improved with increasing sample size except for a heritability value of 5%. Compared to FINEMAP, BOLT had larger RMSE (S2B Table). This suggests that the polygenic assumption of BOLT leads to less accurate estimates compared to FINEMAP in cases where heritability can be attributed to a few causal variants. Genotype data from UKB over 100 GWAS regions were used for phenotype generation. Three GWAS sample sizes (n) and four heritability values (h2) were considered and for each combination of region, sample size and heritability, 10 datasets were generated per GWAS region. Each dataset included three causal variants with joint effect sizes chosen so that the three variants together account for the regional heritability in proportions of 61.8%, 25.8% and 12.4%. For each of the three estimation methods, we show the boxplots of point estimates over the datasets. The horizontal lines mark the true value of heritability.

This may indicate that the regularization method applied by HESS can cause considerable underestimation of heritability in regions with only a few causal variants. We observed that HESS without regularization was upwardly biased across the sample sizes. The RMSE values from HESS were always larger than those from FINEMAP and, in most cases, also larger than those from BOLT (S2B Table). To assess the calibration of uncertainty estimates of h2, we study the coverage of 95% credible and confidence intervals defined as the proportion of intervals that covered the true level of heritability (S2B Table). For FINEMAP, the coverage was always at least 86% while for some of the 95% intervals of BOLT the coverage dropped below 10%. For all sample sizes, the 95% intervals from HESS with and without regularization were clearly miscalibrated for the larger heritabilities because of the systematic bias in heritability estimates. S2B Table also shows the ratio between the average standard error (BOLT and HESS) or average posterior standard deviation (FINEMAP) and the standard deviation of the heritability estimates of the respective method. If the estimated standard error or posterior standard deviation was frequentistically well calibrated, we would expect this ratio to be close to one. We see that for FINEMAP and HESS without regularization, in most scenarios, the ratio is in the range of 0.8–1.2 showing a reasonably good frequentist calibration. For BOLT and HESS with regularization the ratio is systematically above one and often clearly above 1.2, which indicates a worse frequentist calibration of the standard error estimates. S1A Fig shows a comparison of marginal posterior inclusion probabilities (PIPs) between FINEMAP and CAVIARBF across datasets with three causal variants. The strategies for handling large effect regions yield similar PIPs for both methods, but we note that CAVIARBF does not produce estimates of effect sizes or regional heritability. S1B Fig shows a comparison of PIPs from FINEMAP using different strategies to model large effect regions. FINEMAP v1.4 performs well in all settings whereas we observe many false positives when large effects are not appropriately accounted for in the previously published FINEMAP v1.1. This is because when we incorrectly assume that all effects are small, the only way to explain large regional heritability is by stipulating that also many non-causal variants contribute to the heritability. We also evaluated FINEMAP, BOLT and HESS in simulations with fifty randomly chosen causal variants using the 100 GWAS regions. This setting is less suitable for FINEMAP than the previous setting with three causal variants because individual causal variants now explain much less heritability. However, as large biobank data can provide adequate statistical power to detect many individual causal variants even with small effect sizes, these results are useful when we interpret the results from our protein data analysis. FINEMAP was downwardly biased for the smallest h2 of 0.025% and 0.15% (Fig 2A–2C) for all sample sizes except for the smallest sample size n = 5,000 when h2 was 0.025% (Fig 2A). For larger h2 of 5% and 50%, FINEMAP underestimated the heritability when n = 5,000 but this effect diminished with increasing sample size. These results show how the fine-mapping priors, that favor sparse causal models, tend to underestimate the heritability when the heritability is scattered across numerous tiny effects but this underestimation decreases when both the effect sizes and the sample sizes increase. BOLT was weakly upwardly biased for the smallest h2 of 0.025% and 0.15% except when h2 was 0.15% and n = 300,000 (Fig 2A–2C). For larger heritabilities, BOLT provided downwardly biased heritability estimates (Fig 2D–2F). Heritability estimates from HESS in simulations with fifty causal variants were similar to results in simulations with three causal variants (S2A, S2B, S3A and S3B Tables). Genotype data from UKB over 100 GWAS regions were used for phenotype generation. Three GWAS sample sizes (n) and four regional heritability values (h2) were considered and for each combination of region, sample size and heritability, 10 datasets were generated per GWAS region. Each dataset included 50 causal variants with equal effect size. For each of the three estimation methods, we show the boxplots of point estimates over the datasets. The horizontal lines mark the true value of heritability. Genotype data from UKB over 100 GWAS regions were used for phenotype generation.

The coverage of BOLT was always above 72%, except at h2 of 0.025% when n = 5,000 and at h2 of 50% when n = 300,000 the coverage dropped below 60%. For all sample sizes, the 95% intervals from HESS with and without regularization were clearly miscalibrated for the larger heritabilities because of the systematic bias in heritability estimates. For FINEMAP, BOLT and HESS with regularization the ratio between the average standard error (BOLT and HESS) or average posterior standard deviation (FINEMAP) and the standard deviation of the heritability estimates of the respective method was systematically above one and often clearly above 1.2, which indicates a worse frequentist calibration of the standard error estimates. For HESS without regularization the ratio is in the range of 0.8–1.0 showing a reasonably good frequentist calibration. We observed that as heritability and sample size increase, the expected number of causal variants estimated by FINEMAP becomes a reliable statistic to inform us about whether the genetic architecture in the region is sparse or polygenic. In S2 Fig we see that this statistic makes a clear distinction between the sparse and polygenic architectures starting from the setting when h2 = 0.15% and n = 300,000. GWAS of 2,490 unique proteins identified 14,189 genome-wide significant pQTL regions. Using BOLT, we estimated an average polygenic component of heritability from outside the pQTL regions of 0.11 per protein ranging from 0.00 (Transgelin-3, UniProt: Q9UI15) to 0.37 (Cystatin-M, UniProt: Q15828), whereas in 23% of the proteins causal variants in pQTLs estimated by FINEMAP explained more protein level variation than the polygenic component (Fig 3) and on average 36% more regional heritability than the lead variant alone (Fig 4A). FINEMAP analyses further showed that the posterior expected number of causal variants is 2.5 on average, ranging from 1 (Uromodulin, UniProt: P07911) to 30 (Amnionless, UniProt: Q9BXJ7), and that the minor allele frequency (MAF) of causal variants is 0.24 on average, ranging from 0.02 (ADAMTS-like protein 4, UniProt: Q6UY14) to 0.47 (Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 5, UniProt: P06731). The region-specific results are given in S4 Table. Each circle represents the point estimate of heritability (h2) for the pQTL component (sum of variance explained across all pQTLs) vs. the polygenic component (genome-wide heritability excluding regions defined by pQTLs ±5Mb). Heritability was estimated with FINEMAP and BOLT using up to 28,008 unrelated individuals of European ancestry from UKB and genotyped biallelic variants with MAF greater than 1%.

When FINEMAP estimated regional heritability above h2 = 0.01 (2,302 / 14,189 regions), we observed 6.28 (CI0.95: 1.24–18.70) causal variants on average and the heritability estimates from FINEMAP were on average 13% larger than BOLT and 40% larger than HESS with default regularization (Fig 4B and 4C). This suggests that the regional genetic architecture of these pQTLs is not highly polygenic. For the regions where FINEMAP estimated a heritability level below 0.0l, the estimates from FINEMAP were on average 14% lower than BOLT and HESS with default regularization (Fig 5B and 5C). Compared to FINEMAP, the heritability estimates from HESS without regularization (Figs 4D and 5D) were 57% larger on average.

When the heritability captured by FINEMAP was more than h2 = 0.01, BOLT and HESS with default regularization provided respectively 83% and 20% wider 95% confidence intervals on average compared to FINEMAP. HESS without regularization provided 95% confidence intervals that were 162% wider on average compared to 95% credible intervals from FINEMAP. Large biobanks with hundreds of thousands of samples are boosting our ability to fine-map genomic regions, that is, to probabilistically quantify which of the many correlated genetic variants have a putative causal effect on complex traits and diseases. As the power to identify causal variants and the precision of their effect size estimates increases, it is useful to be able to routinely evaluate how much of the phenotypic variance these causal variants explain together and how that compares to regional heritability estimates from models with different assumptions about the genetic architecture. To our knowledge, an estimate of the regional heritability of the fine-mapped variants is not given by the existing probabilistic fine-mapping methods. In this work, we extended the FINEMAP software to output estimates of effect sizes and regional heritability by taking into account the LD structure among the variants and the posterior probability of each putative causal configuration of variants. We performed simulations to verify our implementation and to assess how existing heritability estimation methods BOLT and HESS work in the case where a genomic region truly contains only a few causal variants. Previously, BOLT and HESS have been tested under highly polygenic architectures and here we assessed how they perform when there is considerable regional heritability but its source is not polygenic. We see this as an important piece of information since our goal is to interpret what the possible differences in the regional heritability estimates from FINEMAP, BOLT and HESS reveal about the genetic architecture of the region. We also considered highly polygenic settings where genetic effects would be distributed among numerous variants with tiny effects. In such settings, we expect that reduced statistical power to detect individual causal variants makes fine-mapping difficult and consequently also keeps the regional heritability estimate of FINEMAP low, which was confirmed by our results. Based on previous analyses [14], we expected that some existing methods, such as BOLT and HESS, could still provide reasonable heritability in such highly polygenic regions. Our simulation results show that FINEMAP is nearly unbiased for larger sample sizes and provides accurate uncertainty quantification of the regional heritability estimates when there are only a few causal variants in the region. With BOLT, there was an upward bias for the smallest heritability values possibly because BOLT constrains the REML-estimates to be positive. BOLT overestimated the standard error and had wider confidence intervals compared to FINEMAP, likely due to the simulation setup which differed from the polygenic modeling assumptions of BOLT and was similar to the FINEMAP model. In simulations with 50 causal variants per region, we observed that FINEMAP underestimated the heritability, especially when both the regional heritability and the sample size were small. This is expected since the fine-mapping model assumes sparse genetic architecture, and therefore is not expected to perform well when there are as many as 50 causal variants with small effects. In this setting, BOLT typically provided smaller mean square error and better calibration of 95% intervals than FINEMAP. We also observed that the default regularization method applied by HESS induces a systematic downward bias and low precision in the estimates. The default regularization corresponds to using only the first 50 principal components of the correlation structure of the variants to remove noise present in the trailing components, especially when the LD structure does not match the GWAS summary statistics. A possible explanation for the downward bias is that the weight of the variants contributing to heritability may be weak on the leading principal components and therefore using the default settings in HESS misses important information. In our simulations, we had a perfect match between the LD structure and GWAS summary statistics and we observed that by deactivating the regularization method we could remove the bias for the smallest heritability levels. However, this could not solve the problem for the largest heritability level and led to larger confidence intervals that increased with GWAS sample size. In the protein data analysis, we also observed that deactivating regularization of HESS does not always work even when we have access to the original LD structure. Based on our simulations, our expectation in the analysis of protein data was that the FINEMAP heritability estimates would be bounded from below by the contribution from the variant with the lowest P-value alone and from above by polygenic and fixed-effect models, such as BOLT and HESS, that conceptually consider all variants causal. We indeed observed such a pattern with FINEMAP explaining 36% more regional heritability on average than the variant with the lowest P-value alone. The regional heritability estimates from BOLT tended to be lower than the values from FINEMAP in 58% of pQTLs (977 / 2,302 regions) in which FINEMAP estimated a heritability greater than 0.01 (2,302 / 14,182 regions). A possible explanation is that these pQTLs may contain a heritability contribution that is not highly polygenic and fine-mapping accurately captures it with our sample size of 28,008 individuals. In 78% of pQTLs (9,313 / 11,880 regions) in which regional heritability estimates from FINEMAP were less than 0.01 (11,880 / 14,182 regions), BOLT regional heritability estimates were larger compared to FINEMAP. Similar to our simulations, a part of the higher point estimates of BOLT may result from BOLT constraining the REML-estimates to reside in the interval [0,1] and hence overestimating heritability values close to zero and/or FINEMAP not capturing the lower heritability levels in these pQTLs. The estimates from HESS with default regularization were on average 5% larger compared to FINEMAP. Deactivation of the regularization method of HESS increased the HESS estimates so that they became 57% larger than the values from FINEMAP. A possible explanation is the presence of (nearly) perfectly correlated variants in the pQTL regions making the correlation matrices not invertible or unstable in genomic regions with (nearly) perfectly correlated variants. An ultimate goal in genetics research is to narrow down the polygenic regional heritability into individual variants contributing to heritability and to obtain accurate effect sizes for them. The extensions for effect size and heritability estimation that we have introduced in the FINEMAP software provide a computationally efficient framework to deduce a variant-level picture of the regional genetic architecture. We expect that these new features prove useful as the accuracy of fine-mapping constantly increases with rapidly growing sample size of biobank-scale studies. We used data from the UKB [22] using the Application number 44257. Ethics approval for the UKB study was obtained from the North West Centre for Research Ethics Committee (11/ NW/0382). Proteomic profiling of the UKB was approved by the Access Subcommittee of UKB, under Access Management System Application No. 65851. All participants of the UKB provided written informed consent. The goal of statistical fine-mapping is to refine a large set of genetic variants simply associated with a phenotype down to a much smaller set of variants with direct effect on the phenotype by accounting for the complex correlations between the variants. Although we call the variants with such direct effects “causal”, we bear in mind that further laboratory experiments would be required to establish the exact biological mechanisms of those variants. The statistical framework in FINEMAP (see Web Resources) to infer causal variants is built on Bayesian variable selection for linear regression models [23] using Bayes factors. Previously [18], we derived the Bayes factor to assess the support for each combination of k variants denoted by γ, and hereafter called causal configuration, over the null configuration. Our previous derivation18 implemented in FINEMAP v.1.1, started with a likelihood approximation for the joint linear regression model for all variants in the region and assumed small enough effect sizes that we could ignore the differences in residual variance between causal configurations. In the following, we derive a corresponding Bayes factor by using a likelihood approximation of only the causal variants, which makes the effect size estimation feasible, and by allowing different residual variances for different configurations. For this, we assume the following Bayesian linear regression model for the causal configuration γ, (1) where y is a standardized vector with phenotypic values for n individuals (with is a matrix of dimension n×k with standardized genotypes at the variants, λγ are the additive effect sizes of the standardized variants, is the user-given prior variance for the effect sizes and is the point estimate of the residual variance in the multiple linear regression that we learn from the data (details below). Integrating out effect sizes λγ analytically yields the marginal likelihood of the causal configuration where we reduced computational complexity by applying the Matrix determinant lemma and Woodbury matrix identity on line 2. The computational complexity of evaluating the marginal likelihood can be further reduced substantially by replacing the phenotype-genotype data with GWAS summary statistics and pairwise correlations between variants [15–19]. That is, we replace individual-level data (y,X) with GWAS summary data in which case where is a vector of ratios of effect size estimates and their standard errors from individual univariate linear regressions of each variant in the causal configuration, is a matrix of pairwise sample correlations among the variants and is a diagonal matrix of estimates for residual variances in the univariate linear regressions. Thus, we can compute the Bayes factor to assess the support for a causal configuration γ over the null configuration γ0, that contains no variants, by using only GWAS summary data on variants included in the causal configuration γ Numerically, this Bayes factor agrees with our earlier derivation [18] when causal variants have small effect sizes and hence . With the current derivation of the Bayes factor, we can also account for causal variants with larger effect sizes by allowing for different residual variances for different configurations and we provide a simple way to extract the posterior distribution of the effect sizes as explained next. The posterior distribution of the effect sizes of variants included in a causal configuration is where and . An estimate of the heritability of a causal configuration γ is given by the ratio between the variance explained by the causal variants and the total variance of the phenotype, which we here compute conditional on the effect sizes λγ as (2) where the empirical estimate from the data equals zero because of centered genotypes. Hence our point estimate is and we compute the posterior distribution of by evaluating Eq (2) for each draw from the posterior for λγ. This approach allows us to obtain the mean, standard deviation and 95% credible interval (equal tail area interval) of the posterior. We expect high quality posterior inference if is a good approximation to the pairwise sample correlations computed from the original GWAS genotype data [24]. For quantitative traits, setting the estimates for residual variances in equal to one is a good approximation in genomic regions with small causal effects and FINEMAP v1.1 uses this approximation. However, this approach can lead to problems when causal variants have larger effect sizes [25]. Since FINEMAP v1.2, we account for different magnitudes of effect sizes by calculating, for each variant ℓ, the maximum likelihood estimate for the residual variance in univariate linear regression. If all variants individually account for less than heritability of 1%, we keep in Eq (1) fixed at a value of 1.0 and set the prior variance for the effect size equal to 0.052; this means that a causal variant contributes less than heritability of 1% with probability 0.95 [18]. Otherwise, we expect to see larger effect sizes. In this case, we set in Eq (1) equal to the maximum likelihood estimate for the residual variance from multiple linear regression of variants in the causal configuration γ. For each causal configuration, we further use an equidistant grid of four values for the prior variance with a lower bound at 0.052 and an upper bound where, with probability 0.95, a causal variant contributes less than the point estimate of heritability of a causal configuration γ of the variants with pairwise absolute correlations less than 0.95 that are marginally the most significant and that each contribute more than heritability of 1%. For each grid value, we compute the Bayes factor for assessing the evidence against the null configuration. We obtain the final Bayes factor by computing the average value of the individual Bayes factors. This model averaging corresponds to a uniform prior distribution on over the grid points. Our strategy for adapting to large effect sizes requires no actions from the user and therefore differs from the approach [25] of CAVIARBF v0.2.1 (see Web Resources) which requires user-given values for the prior standard deviation sλ. We compare FINEMAP v1.4 with CAVIARBF and FINEMAP v1.1 on simulated datasets with three causal variants among 150 variants in a genomic region (see “Simulations with GWAS regions”). Each dataset was analyzed with FINEMAP and CAVIARBF using default values and allowing for a maximum of four causal variants in the region. For CAVIARBF, we excluded the null configuration from the output and used multiple values 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8 to specify the prior standard deviation sλ as recommended [25]. The Bayesian variable selection approach to fine-mapping causal variants is a hard combinatorial problem which precludes exhaustive enumeration of all possible causal configurations. In previous work [18], we tackled the combinatorial problem with Shotgun Stochastic Search [26] algorithm to identify a list of causal configurations which captures a large majority of the total posterior probability [18]. According to the Bayesian paradigm, we account for model uncertainty through Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) [27]. BMA combines inference about a quantity common to all models by averaging the posterior distribution of that quantity under each model using posterior model probabilities as weights. Using BMA, we compute the PIP for the ℓth variant by summing up the posterior probability of all causal configurations in which this variant is included. We model-average estimates of heritability to quantify the contribution of causal variants. Examples of other useful model-averaged estimates are the posterior effect size mean and standard deviation of the ℓth variant. We output marginalized shrinkage estimates of the posterior effect size mean and standard deviation by averaging over all causal configurations assuming that the effect size of the ℓth variant is zero if the variant is absent from a causal configuration. We also output the conditional estimates of the posterior effect size mean and standard deviation conditional on inclusion by averaging over only those causal configurations in which the ℓth variant is included. The magnitude of the conditional model-averaged estimate of the ℓth variant is much larger than the shrinkage model-averaged estimate if the PIP for the ℓth variant is small. Variance component models are extensively used for heritability estimation under a polygenic model assumption. We performed regional heritability estimation from individual-level genotype-phenotype data with BOLT v2.3 (see Web Resources) using default settings. In genome-wide analyses, we used an LD pruned set of variants (—indep-pairwise 1000 100 0.8, see Web Resources) while in regional analyses we used an unpruned set of variants to maintain comparability to other methods that estimate regional heritability. Since the model assumption of polygenicity may not hold in any particular genomic region [14], we also estimated regional heritability with HESS v0.5.2 (see Web Resources) to avoid assumptions about causal effect sizes. HESS requires GWAS summary statistics and genotype data to compute pairwise correlations between the variants to account for LD. To keep the allele coding between GWAS summary statistics and pairwise correlations consistent and maintain comparability with FINEMAP, we modified HESS to read in the same pre-computed pairwise correlations obtained from the original GWAS genotype data as we use in FINEMAP. We further used marginal effect size estimates on the standardized scale as input to HESS (personal communication with the authors of HESS). We ran HESS on approximately independent LD blocks [28] using all variants in the genomic region and default settings. We also ran HESS without default adjustment for noise in the LD matrix by setting the command-line flags—max-num-eig m and—min-eigval 10−8, as recommended by the authors of HESS, where m is the number of variants in the genomic region. We used genotype data on 426,844 individuals of EUR ancestry (see Web Resources) provided by UKB. For documentation about imputation of the UKB genotype data see Web Resources. We retained genotyped biallelic variants with MAF greater than 1% and excluded related individuals with KING’s [29] kinship coefficient greater than 0.0442 using a greedy algorithm that maximizes the final sample size. This left us with 374,073 samples in UKB. We used plasma level concentrations of 2,940 unique proteins measured with the antibody-based Olink Explore 3072 Proximity Extension Assay (PEA) across a randomly chosen set of 32,867 unrelated individuals of European ancestry included in UKB. Details about the proteomics data are given in Sun et al. [30]. Protein level concentrations were adjusted by age, age2, sex, age × sex, age2 × sex, batch, UKB assessment center, UKB genetic array, time between blood sampling and measurement and the first 20 genetic principal components using a linear regression model. Regression residuals were normalized using a rank-based transformation to the standard Normal distribution. The UK Biobank Pharma Proteomics Projects (UKB-PPP) used REGENIE (see Web Resources) to test genome-wide associations with 2,940 proteins. We defined the level of statistical significance as P < 1.7×10−11 corresponding to the standard genome-wide significance level (P < 5 × 10−8) corrected for the number of proteins analyzed (5 × 10−8 / 2940 = 1.7×10−11). The pQTLs were defined through clumping ±1Mb around statistically significant variants, excluding the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region which is treated as one locus due to complex and extensive LD patterns. Physically overlapping regions were merged into one, deeming the variant with the lowest P-value as the lead variant. We estimated regional heritability with BOLT, HESS and FINEMAP across 14,189 pQTLs from the UKB-PPP in 28,008 unrelated individuals of European ancestry. Our motivation to use unrelated individuals is to prevent the possibility of bias across the three methods. For FINEMAP and HESS we generated summary statistics with a linear model implemented in PLINK2 (see Web Resources). With FINEMAP we either allowed for thirty causal variants or only one causal variant to estimate the heritability captured by the lead variant. The polygenic component of heritability was estimated with BOLT using genome-wide variants outside of regions defined by pQTLs ±5Mb. In the Paraoxonase 1 cis-pQTL, we performed a stepwise conditional analysis implemented in PLINK2 by first conditioning on the variant with the lowest P-value, hereafter called the lead variant, and then iteratively adding to the model the variant with the lowest conditional P-value until no further variant reached the standard genome-wide significance threshold (P < 5 × 10−8) or until we had conducted a pre-specified number of iterations. To assess how different methods estimate regional heritability we performed comprehensive simulations over genomic regions chosen from GWAS meta-analyses for coronary artery disease (CAD) [31], Crohn’s disease (CD) [32], lipid traits (LIPs) [33], schizophrenia (SCZ) [34], and type 2 diabetes (T2D) [35]. For each study, we retained the lead variants outside the HLA region with a marginal P-value less than 5 × 10−8 and selected 100 lead variants (18 from CAD, 20 from CD, 21 from LIPs, 21 from SCZ, and 20 from T2D) for further analyses. Around each lead variant, we defined genomic regions of 3 Mb. We considered the following fine-mapping setting: Increasing regional heritability (h2 = 0.00025, 0.0015, 0.05, 0.5) Increasing number of causal variants (m = 3, 50) Increasing GWAS sample size (n = 5,000, 50,000, 300,000) A total of 1,000 datasets (10 replicates per each region) were generated under each of the 24 combinations of scenarios H, M and N using the following linear model where C is the set of causal variants, gc the vector of standardized genotypes from 374,073 UKB individuals at the cth causal variant, βc the standardized effect size of the cth variant and ϵ is Normal noise with mean 0 and variance . Causal variants were randomly chosen. In datasets with three causal variants, the joint causal effect sizes were specified such that in the true causal configuration, the three variants accounted for 61.8%, 25.8% and 12.4% of the regional heritability, respectively (That is, the effect size of a standardized genotype variable of a causal variant was (h2×p)1/2, where h2 is the regional heritability and p is the proportion of heritability accounted for by the variant). These per-variant proportions were chosen from a meta-analysis of the association between MC4R locus and body mass index [36]. In simulations with fifty causal variants, joint causal effect sizes were specified such that each causal variant accounted for the same proportion of regional heritability. For each set of 1,000 simulations, we report the average heritability estimates and the average standard error (BOLT, HESS) or posterior standard deviation (FINEMAP). We also assess the uncertainty of heritability estimates across 100 simulated datasets of the same region with causal variants kept fixed. For 95% credible and confidence intervals (normal approximations), we calculate their coverage as the proportion of intervals that covered the true level of heritability. We also compute the RMSE defined as the square root of the average squared deviation of the estimated heritability from the true level of heritability. RMSE summarizes both bias and precision of the estimation procedures with smaller RMSE values indicating better performance.

Title: Crypto Daybook Americas: Turmoil Across The Pond as Bitcoin Defends $93K After $300B Wipeout

You are viewing Crypto Daybook Americas, your new morning briefing on what happened in the crypto markets overnight and what's expected during the coming day. In the coming weeks, this daily update will replace the First Mover Americas newsletter, and arrive in your inbox at 7 a.m. ET to kickstart your morning with comprehensive insights. If you're not already subscribed, click here. You won't want to start your day without it. By James Van Straten (All times ET unless indicated otherwise) The total cryptocurrency industry is now under $3.2 trillion in market capitalization, as over $300 billion has been wiped out since Jan. 6, taking away all early gains for the year, according to the TradingView metric TOTAL. As a result, bitcoin (BTC) is now hovering above $93,000 but has been making a succession of higher lows starting from Dec. 30. Adding to the bearish sentiment, market is digesting the unconfirmed reports from DB News which suggest that the U.S. government has been given the green light to liquidate as much as 69,370 BTC ($6.5B) from the Silk Road seizure. This makes the political theatre between the outgoing and incoming U.S. administrations even more intriguing, as president-elect Donald Trump, who is just few days away from being sworn in on Jan. 20, vowed not to sell any of the bitcoin held by U.S. authorities, which, according to Glassnode data, amounts to 187,236 BTC. The onslaught in the crypto industry stems from an extremely high DXY index, above 109, which measures the value of the U.S. Dollar relative to a weighted basket of major foreign currencies. In addition, for a brief moment, the U.S. treasury yields were rising before retreating slightly yesterday. The benchmark for 10-year yield was as high as 4.73%. The inflation concerns that paddled the selloff in the broader market is picking up alongside growth expectations, LondonCryptoClub told CoinDesk. "The combination of rising growth and inflation expectations alongside rising term premia as the market struggles to digest huge treasury supply to fund these deficits is pushing U.S. yields higher, which is dragging global yields higher, excluding China." However, turmoil is occurring across the pond in the U.K., with gilt yields continuing to march higher this morning. Records were set today, as the 30-year U.K. jumped to almost 5.45%, the highest level since 1998. While the benchmark U.K. 10-year challenged 4.95%, the highest since 2008, the treasury was forced to intervene in the market to calm investors, according to reports from The Telegraph. LondonCryptoClub mentioned the key reasons for the turmoil, "the U.K. is under pressure after a disastrous budget which has increased borrowing needs with little to no positive growth impact, exacerbating the negative debt/GDP dynamics and driving a larger fiscal deficit." As a result, the not-so-Great British pound, falling yet again, is now 1.22 against the dollar, the lowest level since November 2023, and has fallen almost 4% in the past month. Today, Jan. 9, is declared a mourning day in the U.S. to remember the death of former President Jimmy Carter. Therefore, the stock market will be closed. So, all eyes will be turning to the jobs report on Friday. The market is in a good news is bad news scenario as rate cuts for 2025 get pushed back with only one rate cut expected for 2025. A strong jobs report could remove this rate cut, with unemployment expected to come in at 4.2%, while nonfarm payroll is estimated at 154,000. A hot jobs print could send the dollar to 110, putting further pressure on risk-assets. Stay alert! By Shaurya MalwaA parody token just got its own parody. AI Agents upstart ai16z, a platform mimicking venture fund a16z that uses AI to manage user funds, saw a mockery of its token raffle among smallcap speculators in the past day, running to a peak of $130 million market capitalization as of European morning hours. Where ai16z tried to blend AI with investment, LLM — short for “Large Language Model” laughs at the very concept, suggesting that if AI can be anything, it can certainly be a meme with no real utility. X users were quick to dub LLM as the "McDonald's version of $ai16z," mixing fast food with AI, creating a narrative where the only intelligence was in the marketing. Some thoughts about $LLM: it's the perfect token to mock $ai16z.1. It uses an AI-related term but is actually a funny meme without any utility, much like $fartcoin.2. It emerged organically and has a perfect distribution—everyone had a chance to buy it even before pf bonding.… It has no inherent utility or technological backing; its value is purely speculative and community-driven, based on the meme's popularity and the humor it brings to the crypto conversation. I bought it because it was funny — But now, it’s turned into a community + the ticker is ideal for the meta we’re in + the word play on the ticker can’t be funnier. AI Agent projects virtuals (VIRTUALS), ai16z (AI16Z) and the broader category are down more than 20% since peak on average in the past weeks amid criticism of their claimed AI models, as a CoinDesk analysis previously noted.

With a new Presidential administration set to take office in less than two weeks, there’s a feeling of change in the air. Some of the changes are already clear – President-elect Trump has made clear his intent to implement new tax policies, and his previous term in office has already shown that he favors pro-business, growth-oriented economic policies, along with economic deregulation. The combination promises to keep the good times rolling in the stock markets. Discover outperforming stocks and invest smarter with Top Smart Score Stocks Filter, analyze, and streamline your search for investment opportunities using Tipranks' Stock Screener Watching the situation from Wolfe Research, analyst Shweta Khajuria sees plenty of options for investors who aim to cash in on a rising tide. Sound consumer demand, lower interest rates, and low unemployment, in her view, will provide a broad base of support for the overall economy – and for her own preference, of internet stocks. “We remain opportunistic within the Internet sector. We expect fundamentals to remain stable with healthy top-line growth from penetration gains & product launches, ongoing margin expansion, and capital allocation efforts,” Khajuria opined. Getting into specifics, the 5-star analyst has selected Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) as two of the best internet stocks to buy right now. According to the TipRanks database, these ‘Magnificent 7’ stocks have also earned a ‘Strong Buy’ rating from the rest of the Street. Let’s dive into the details and take a closer look at each of them. Amazon The first stock we’ll look at, Amazon, is the world leader in e-commerce, and a fast-growing giant in both cloud computing and AI services. Amazon was founded in 1994 and has proven itself to be a survivor – the company lived through the dot-com bubble burst and has grown out of its origins as ‘the online bookseller’ to become the digital world’s one-stop shop. As the global e-commerce leader, Amazon boasts that it can deliver any product to any place, and it follows through. The result is a behemoth of a company, with a market cap of $2.39 trillion. Amazon’s online retail is its core business, and made up 83% of its total revenue in the third quarter of 2024, the last period reported. Of its $131.4 billion revenue haul, $95.5 billion came from the North America segment; $35.9 billion came from international sales. The company saw its highest year-over-year revenue growth in its cloud computing subscription service, AWS, which expanded 19% y/y to reach $27.5 billion. Amazon’s overall Q3 revenue came to $158.9 billion, up 11% from the prior year and beating the forecast by $1.6 billion. Amazon reported a free cash flow of $47.7 billion for the 12 months ending on September 30, 2024, up 123% year-over-year, and the company finished Q3 with more than $78 billion in cash and liquid assets on hand. What all of this means is that Amazon has deep pockets and plenty of resources to expand and modernize both its e-commerce and cloud computing activities. The company is doing just that and is making strong use of AI as it does so. On the retail activity side, Amazon is using AI to improve its customer interfaces. The company has introduced an AI-powered shopping assistant to smooth out the process of searching the retail database for exactly the right product at the right price, and already uses AI to improve its online advertising activities. On the cloud side, Amazon is integrating AI capabilities and tools into the AWS platform and is working with the AI development company Anthropic to build generative AI models for Bedrock, Amazon’s own AI cloud platform. In addition, Amazon, under the AWS aegis, is developing and releasing a family of semiconductor chips, Trainium, designed specifically to train AI and natural language systems. At the bottom line, all of this has made Amazon enormously profitable. The company realized earnings of $1.43 per share in 3Q24, a figure that was 29 cents better than the forecasts. In addition, Amazon’s stock is up 49% in the last 12 months, outperforming the NASDAQ’s 31% gain by a wide margin. Checking in with analyst Khajuria and the Wolfe view, we find her bullish on Amazon, specifically citing the company’s strengths. Khajuria writes, “We named AMZN as a top pick at the time of our launch in July ’24, and we continue to remain constructive on it based on our three-pronged thesis: i) Upside to retail margins driven by operational efficiency gains, automation, Ad revenue growth, and sustainable Int’l profitability; ii) Healthy, sustainable AWS revenue growth in the HT% range driven by demand for AI-based workloads and inference, Trainium chips, and Anthropic; iii) Ongoing market share consolidation driven by fast delivery speeds and availability of non-discretionary items.” Moving forward from this stance, Khajuria puts an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating on AMZN stock. This is complemented by a $270 price target that implies a one-year upside potential of 21%. (To watch Khajuria’s track record, click here) Overall, this mega-cap e-commerce giant has earned a Strong Buy consensus rating from the Street, based on 47 recent analyst reviews that show a lopsided split of 46 Buys to just 1 Hold. The shares are priced at $222.11 and their average target price of $249.62 suggests they will gain 12% in the year ahead. (See AMZN stock forecast) Meta Platforms The second stock we’ll look at here today is Meta Platforms, the global leader in social media and the parent company of Facebook, along with Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. Meta’s family of social apps had a collective DAP, or daily active people, of 3.29 billion in September 2024 – meaning that this company can effectively reach 41% of the world’s population. That’s a huge number, and it underscores just how effective Mark Zuckerberg’s company has been at building social media into a global force. Meta has used its unprecedented reach to support its revenue-generating activities, primarily digital advertising. The company’s huge audience gives it access to an enormous well of data, which can be used to fine-tune online advertising campaigns or simply sold to advertisers. In its last quarterly report, covering 3Q24, Meta reported an 11% year-over-year increase in the average price paid per ad on its platform. This solid metric helped push the company’s total revenue in the quarter to $40.59 billion, beating the forecast by $280 million while growing 19% year-over-year. Meta’s stock, like Amazon’s above, has outperformed the broader markets by a wide margin, gaining 73% in the last 12 months. That Meta is successful is beyond doubt. The company has achieved this success by adapting to changes in the digital landscape – some of those changes brought on by the very social media revolution that it helped to start. One good example is the company’s reaction to the strength of Twitter, or X, as owner Elon Musk has rebranded it. Meta developed its own threads-based app, appropriately dubbed Threads, which it launched in July 2023 as a competitor. While Threads has not yet reached the popularity of X, it has reached the milestone of 200 million active users. Meta also stands to gain from an Act of Congress which was upheld at the Federal appeals level last month. The act orders the Chinese company ByteDance to divest itself of the popular social video app TikTok – if it wants to keep the app available in the US. If the Chinese company does not comply, it risks having TikTok banned from US internet providers. While enforcement of such a ban would be difficult at best, the prospect of it may give a boost to Meta. Meta has developed several social video apps of its own (Reels and Stories on Facebook) and is strongly positioned to grab a large part of TikTok’s 170 million-strong audience should the Chinese app face a ban. The upshot to all of this is that, while Meta may be the ‘old man’ in the rapidly evolving social media world, it is hardly moribund. The company is smart and adaptable, and has proven itself capable of meeting changing conditions while realizing sound profits. Its 3Q24 earnings figure came to $6.03 per share, beating the forecast by 74 cents and growing 37% year-over-year. For Wolfe’s Khajuria, the key here is that Meta’s combination of social apps, its strength in video apps, and its ability to meet changing conditions make the company a ‘top pick.’ As she puts it, “We remain constructive despite the significant outperformance over the last two years given our view that Street estimates offer upside. Our thesis: i) We think video unification remains underappreciated based on our detailed analysis, we forecast upside to 2025 Street ests. by MSD $B; ii) We size Threads opportunity as potentially adding LSD $Bs with monetization starting in ’25; iii) TikTok divestiture remains uncertain, but should that happen, we see 8 to 10% upside to EPS; iv) Cleaner AI narrative as multi-year investments have better positioning to show ROIC potential.” Bottom line, Khajuria puts an Outperform (i.e. Buy) rating on Meta, and backs that with a $730 price target, showing her confidence in a 16% upside potential over the next 12 months. Meta has 43 recent analyst reviews on file, and these break down to 39 Buys, 3 Holds, and 1 Sell. The shares are currently trading for $617.89 and the average target price of $683.72 implies a one-year potential gain of 10.5%.
